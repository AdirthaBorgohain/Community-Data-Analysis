1199315,22736,65,Enhancing the robot avateering metaphor discreetly with an assistive agent and its effect on perception,2014,"We present a modeling approach to develop an agent that assists users discreetly in teleoperation when avateering a robot via an inexpensive motion sensor. Avateering is a powerful metaphor, and can be an effective teleoperating strategy. Avateering a Humanoid Robot (HR) with no wearable device encumberment, such as using the popular Kinect/NUI motion sensor, is also desirable and very promising. However, this control scheme makes it difficult for the slave robot to make contact and interact with objects with high accuracy due to factors such as viewpoint, individually-unique and unilateral human-side control imprecision, and lack of informative tactile feedback. Our research explores the addition of an assistive agent that arbitrates user input without disrupting the overall experience and expectation. Additionally, our agent assists with maintaining a higher level of accuracy for interaction tasks, in our case, a grasping and lifting scenario. Using theWebots robot simulator, we implemented 4 assistive agents to augment the user in avateering the Darwin-OP robot. The agent iterations are described, and results of a user study are presented. We discuss user perception towards the avateering metaphor when enhanced by the agent and also when unassisted, including perceived easiness of the task, responsiveness of the robot, and accuracy."
57827,22736,20332,Affective recruitment of distributed heterogeneous agents,2004,"Members of multi-robot teams may need to collaborate to accomplish a task due to differences in capabilities. This paper describes an extension of the ALLIANCE architecture that enables agent recruitment within a decentralized UAV-UGV robot team without task preemption but 1) uses a formal model of emotions and 2) handles heterogeneity. Affective computing allows recruitment to be robust under loss of communication between agents and minimizes the number of messages passed. Data from 66 simulations show that the affective strategy succeeds with a random message loss rate up to 25% and requires 19.1% fewer messages to be sent compared to greedy and random, and that of these, affective scales best with team size. Comparisons of broadcast to unicast messaging are also made in simulation."
1881493,22736,65,Towards retro-projected robot faces: An alternative to mechatronic and android faces,2009,"This paper presents a new implementation of a robot face using retro-projection of a video stream onto a semitransparent facial mask. The technology is contrasted against mechatronic robot faces, of which Kismet is a typical example, and android robot faces, as used on the Ishiguro robots. The paper highlights the strengths of Retro-projected Animated Faces (RAF) technology (with cost, flexibility and robustness being notably strong) and discusses potential developments."
2506984,22736,65,"Design of a therapeutic robotic companion for relational, affective touch",2005,"Much research has shown the positive health benefits of companion animals. Unfortunately these animals are not always available to patients due to allergies, risk of disease, or other reasons. Recently, this application domain has attracted attention of robotics researchers. The Huggable is a new type of robotic companion capable of active relational and affective touch-based interactions with a person. It features a high number of somatic sensors (electric field, temperature, and force) over the entire surface of the robot, underneath a soft silicons skin and fur fabric covering. This paper describes the design and early results in recognizing affective content of touch for this robot."
66667,22736,11187,Animal vibrissae: modeling and adaptive control of bio-inspired sensors,2013,"The reception of vibrations is a special sense of touch, important for many insects and vertebrates. The latter realize this reception by means of hair-shaped vibrissae in the mystacial pad, to acquire tactile information about their environments. The system models have to allow for stabilizing and tracking control while nevertheless being able to detect superimposed solitary excitations. Controllers have to be adaptive in view of both the randomness of the external signals to be suppressed and the uncertainty of system data. We presents mechanical models and an improved adaptive control strategy that avoids identification but renders the system sensitive."
1054843,22736,65,Gender identification bias induced with texture images on a life size retro-projected face screen,2012,"A retro-projected face display system has great advantages in being able to present realistic 3D appearances to users and to easily switch the appearance of the humanoid robot heads animated on the display. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate how effectively users can perceive various information from such devices and what type of animation is suitable for human-robot interaction — in particular, face-to-face communication with robots. In this paper, we examine how facial texture images affect people's ability to identify the gender of faces displayed on a retro-projected face screen system known as Mask-bot. In an evaluation study, we use a female face screen as the 3D output surface, and display various face images morphed between male and female. Subjects are asked to rate the gender of each projected face. We found that even though the output 3D mask screen has a female shape, gender identification is strongly determined by texture images, especially in the case of high-quality images."
1957770,22736,65,Emotional gait: Effects on humans' perception of humanoid robots,2014,"Humanoid robots have this formidable advantage to possess a body quite similar in shape to humans. This body grants them, obviously, locomotion but also a medium to express emotions without even needing a face. In this paper we propose to study the effects of emotional gaits from our biped humanoid robot on the subjects' perception of the robot (recognition rate of the emotions, reaction time, anthropomorphism, safety, likeness, etc.). We made the robot walk towards the subjects with different emotional gait patterns. We assessed positive (Happy) and negative (Sad) emotional gait patterns on 26 subjects divided in two groups (whether they were familiar with robots or not). We found that even though the recognition of the different types of patterns does not differ between groups, the reaction time does. We found that emotional gait patterns affect the perception of the robot. The implications of the current results for Human Robot Interaction (HRI) are discussed."
2389631,22736,65,Anthropomorphization of an Object by Displaying Robot,2006,"This study proposes a system named ?displaying robot? which anthropomorphize an environmental object. Although there are many studies on anthropomorphic agents to communicate with humans about an environmental object, a communication becomes irritating because we need to communicate with agents additionally. On the other hand, displaying robot is attachable device which imitates human body parts for anthropomorphization. Since displaying robot anthropomorphize an environmental object itself, it can conduct task-related communication without additional anthropomorphic agents. We design one of the displaying robots using two eyes, named ?Iris-board? which are attached to home appliances or furniture. We conducted an experiment to verify the effectiveness of a body image with attaching Iris-board to a home appliance. The result indicated that there is a significant difference between anthropomorphized home appliance and normal home appliance."
1543679,22736,65,Vibrotactile display approach that modifies roughness sensations of real textures,2012,"In this study, we developed vibrotactile display methods that can assist designers in product design. In order to achieve realistic sensations required for such designing purposes, we used real materials such as cloth, paper, wood, and leather and applied vibrotactile stimuli to modify the roughness sensations of these materials. This approach allowed us to present textures of various virtual materials with a strong sense of reality. We verified that our proposed methods could selectively modify the fine and macro-roughness sensations of real materials. The methods are expected to aid product designers in deciding tactile sensations suitable for their products."
2458493,22736,65,Online touch behavior recognition of hard-cover robot using temporal decision tree classifier,2008,"Touch is obviously an important channel along with vision and speech for natural human robot Interaction. However, as most service robots are generally specialized for their own service, touch-centered shape design and additional costs/computation less related to their own tasks can represent a limit to the application of a touch system on a service robot. This paper originated from the motivation to apply a touch system with lower costs/computation to robots without design modifications. The proposed touch recognition system features hardware that is simply composed of charge-transfer touch sensor arrays, an accelerometer and a temporal decision tree classifier intended for online recognition and computational time reduction. Experiments performed by 12 people shows the practicability of the system. The results showed an average recognition rate of 83% with respect to the 4 touch patterns of hit, beat, rub and push."
1688583,22736,9475,A mechanism design model in robot-service-queue control with strategic operators and asymmetric information,2012,Understanding various factors affecting human operator's performance is one key to effectively controlling a multi-robot service queue. In this paper we study the optimal incentive design and task allocation scheme in the presence of strategic human operators with unknown capability information. We build a mechanism design framework to model and analyze the problem. We show that a simple and easy-to-implement two-payment-level system can motivate operators to explore the appropriateness of their adopted workload and to devote their capacities optimal to the system. The subsequent analytical and numerical investigation provides insights into understanding the way it affects the control strategies in a multi-robot service queue to account for human operators' strategic behaviors.
1910469,22736,65,Context-based interaction using pointing movements recognition for an intelligent home service robot,2007,"This paper presents human-robot interaction using pointing movements for a home robot. Pointing movement is an important communication tool in interpersonal communication. However, pointing has different means depending on a situation. We research that recognizes users' intentions by using their pointing in particular situations. Our aim is not to calculate accurately the point indicated by a user. The system recognizes objects or the pointing direction, and decides its own action by automatically considering context. To find an object or indicated point interactively, we constructed a virtual room, which was built based on an actual room. The virtual room has information of object property, such as location and moveable or not. A service robot decides its own action using the information from the virtual room. This paper shows experiments a support, moving or pick-up an object."
2890334,22736,9080,A Real World Multi-UAV Evolutionary Planner for Minimum Time Target Detection,2016,"This paper presents a new evolutionary planner for optimizing the input commands of multiple Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) in target search missions. This planner minimizes the target detection time and maximizes the UAVs performance, given 1) the uncertainty in the target location and sensor information, and 2) the UAV motion and sensorial payload models. On one hand, it calculates the detection time related criteria using Bayesian theory to handle the uncertainty of the problem. On the other hand, it measures the UAVs performance against a real kinematic model that takes into account some environmental effects. Besides, it exploits the typical versatility and good performance of evolutionary algorithms to tackle this search problem as a multi-objective and multi-stepped receding horizon controller, capable of providing acceptable long term (less-myopic) decisions due to a novel optimization criterium that weights the future expected observations with the UAV manoeuvrability constraints. All these properties let it handle successfully the minimum time target detection task in real world scenarios, as the results analyzed in this paper, obtained over different setups, show."
824634,22736,9080,Multi-agent task allocation: learning when to say no,2008,"This paper presents a communication-less multi-agent task allocation procedure that allows agents to use past experience to make non-greedy decisions about task assignments. Experimental results are given for problems where agents have varying capabilities, tasks have varying difficulties, and agents are ignorant of what tasks they will see in the future. These types of problems are difficult because the choice an agent makes in the present will affect the decisions it can make in the future. Current task-allocation procedures, especially the market-based ones, tend to side-step the issue by ignoring the future and assigning tasks to agents in a greedy way so that short-term goals are met. It is shown here that these short-sighted allocation procedures work well in situations where the ratio of task length to team size is small, but their performance decreases as this ratio increases. The adaptive method presented here is shown to perform well in a wide range of task-allocation problems, and because it requires no explicit communication, its computational costs are independent of team size."
2052731,22736,21106,A multibaseline stereo system with active illumination and real-time image acquisition,1995,"We describe our implementation of a parallel depth recovery scheme for a four-camera multibaseline stereo in a convergent configuration. Our system is capable of image capture at video rate. This is critical in applications that require three-dimensional tracking. We obtain dense stereo depth data by projecting a light pattern of frequency modulated sinusoidally varying intensity onto the scene, thus increasing the local discriminability at each pixel and facilitating matches. In addition, we make most of the camera view areas by converging them at a volume of interest. Results show that we are able to extract stereo depth data that are, on the average, less than 1 mm in error at distances between 1.5 to 3.5 m away from the cameras. >"
2578313,22736,10174,Planning the Behaviour of Low-Cost Quadcopters for Surveillance Missions,2014,"Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly regarded as a valid low-cost alternative to UAVs and ground robots in surveillance missions and a number of other civil and military applications. Research on autonomous MAVs is still in its infancy and has focused almost exclusively on integrating control and computer vision techniques to achieve reliable autonomous flight. In this paper, we describe our approach to using automated planning in order to elicit high-level intelligent behaviour from autonomous MAVs engaged in surveillance applications. Planning offers effective tools to handle the unique challenges faced by MAVs that relate to their fast and unstable dynamics as well as their low endurance and small payload capabilities. We demonstrate our approach by focusing on the Parrot AR.Drone2.0 quadcopter and Search-and-Tracking missions, which involve searching for a mobile target and tracking it after it is found."
2375821,22736,9616,Active tracking based on Hausdorff matching,2000,We present an object tracking system based on an edge model for the target characterization. The target position is estimated by looking for the model in the current image using a Hausdorff partial distance. Target is searched only in a sub-window of current edge image. Its boundaries are determined by Kalman filter estimation that uses target dynamics to predict the current position. We use a spiral searching strategy to find the actual position. The target model is updated in each iteration by using unidirectional partial distance from the image to the model. This model is refined by an enclosure operator in order to perform the target/background discrimination. The parameters of our system can be modified in an active way along the tracking task. The system is shown to be robust to illumination changes and pose variations. The system has been also embedded in a mobile robot for personal robotics applications and integrated in a real-time OS (3 Hz).
2112531,22736,9475,Probabilistic mutual localization in multi-agent systems from anonymous position measures,2010,"Recent research on multi-agent systems has produced a plethora of decentralized controllers that implicitly assume various degrees of agent localization. However, many practical arrangements commonly taken to allow and achieve localization imply some form of centralization, from the use of physical tagging to allow the identification of the single agent to the adoption of global positioning systems based on cameras or GPS. These devices clearly decrease the system autonomy and range of applicability, and should be avoided if possible. Following this guideline, this work addresses the mutual localization problem with anonymous relative position measures, presenting a robust solution based on a probabilistic framework. The proposed localization system exhibits higher accuracy and lower complexity (O(n 2 )) than our previous method [1]. Moreover, with respect to more conventional solutions that could be conceived on the basis of the current literature, our method is theoretically suitable for tasks requiring frequent, many-to-many encounters among agents (e.g., formation control, cooperative exploration, multiple-view environment sensing). The proposed localization system has been validated by means of an extensive experimental study."
2284032,22736,65,BALT & CAST: Middleware for Cognitive Robotics,2007,"In this paper we present a toolkit for implementing architectures for intelligent robotic systems.

The purpose of both the schema and toolkit is to facilitate research into information-processing architectures for state-of-the- art intelligent robots, whilst providing engineering solutions for the development of such systems. A robotic system implemented using the toolkit is presented to demonstrate its key features."
923313,22736,9078,Integrating visual and range data for road detection,2013,"This paper presents a new method for detecting drivable road surfaces in a single image. The method takes advantage of range and visual information so that reliable results are achieved. Specifically, given LIDAR data and an aligned image, it first makes use of 3D points to estimate the ground plane and determine the horizon. Then, subsets of road and obstacle points are extracted from the 3D points based on the plane and LIDAR properties. The pixels registered to the extracted points are used to build apriori road and non-road appearance models. The road detection problem is further formulated using Markov random field whose energy function is defined based on the learned models. Constraints are also added on the energy function to place high confidence on the pixels that are registered to extracted 3D points. Extensive experiments on urban roads and highways show that our method is robust even in complicated environments."
2258749,22736,65,Facial expression imitation in human robot interaction,2008,"In this paper, we propose an interactive system for reconstructing human facial expression. In the system, a nonlinear mass-spring model is employed to simulate twenty two facial musclespsila tensions during facial expressions, and then the elastic forces of these tensions are grouped into a vector which is used as the input for facial expression recognition. The experimental results show that the nonlinear facial mass-spring model coupled with the SVM classifier is effective to recognize the facial expressions. Finally, we introduce our robot that can make artificial facial expressions. Experimental results of facial expression generation demonstrate that our robot can imitate six types of facial expressions."
2228818,22736,65,A mobile robot platform based on spring loaded casters for physical interaction,2011,"As the number of mobile robot applications increases, research related to physical contact between humans and robots is becoming an important issues in the service robot domain. In this paper, a mobile robot platform based on spring loaded casters is proposed as solution to problems in the service robot domain. A simple dynamic equation in two dimensions was computed and the dynamic characteristics according to variation of the elastic coefficient were analyzed. In order to detect force from a human, a linear equation was formulated by regression of the driving data. With the estimated force, an impedance model is applied to the controller for compliance. Through this process, it is shown that the proposed mobile robot platform is capable of a compliant reaction to external force through of its posture, similar to unstable mobile platform, though the mobile platform has the static stability."
2508235,22736,9616,Target Model Estimation using Particle Filters for Visual Servoing,2006,"In this paper, we present a novel method for model estimation for visual servoing. This method employs a particle filter algorithm to estimate the depth of the image features online. A Gaussian probabilistic model is employed to model the object points in the current camera frame. A set of 3D samples drawn from the model is projected into the image space in the next frame. The 3D sample that maximizes the likelihood is considered to be the most probable real-world 3D point. The variance value of the depth density function converges to very small value within a few iterations. Results show accurate estimate of the depth/model and a high level of stability in the visual servoing process."
1497755,22736,21106,Underwater sensing with omni-directional stereo camera,2011,"In this paper, we propose an underwater sensing method by using an omni-directional stereo camera system. When observing objects in water through a camera contained in a waterproof housing or observing objects in an aquarium tank filled with preserving liquid, we should solve a problem of light refraction at the boundary surfaces of refractive index discontinuity which gives image distortion. The proposed method uses two omni-directional cameras that have wide field of view to measure underwater environments. A ray tracing technique solves the problem of image distortion caused by refractive index discontinuity. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed method."
2313477,22736,65,Grasp Programming by Demonstration: A task-based quality measure,2008,"This paper addresses the issue of how Programming by Demonstration can assist the development of task-related grasping capabilities in a robotic system. Finding a proper quality measure for the evaluation of grasping tasks is a crucial topic for service robots. While classical grasp quality measures do not include task information, we propose a measure which takes into account user experience. Experiments have been performed in a virtual environment that enables real-time human interaction by means of a dataglove and a motion tracker. Also, a local grasp optimization technique is described to amend uncertainties arising from user demonstration. Finally, the grasp quality measure has been applied for synthesizing manipulation tasks with a simulated robot arm."
2006986,22736,23735,Mutual localization using anonymous bearing measurements,2011,"This paper addresses the problem of mutual localization in multi-robot systems in presence of anonymous (i.e., without the identity information) bearing-only measurements. The solution of this problem is relevant for the design and implementation of any decentralized multi-robot algorithm/control. A novel algorithm for probabilistic multiple registration of these measurements is presented, where no global localization, distances, or identity are used. With respect to more conventional solutions that could be conceived on the basis of the current literature, our method is theoretically suitable for tasks requiring frequent, many-to-many encounters among agents (e.g., formation control, cooperative exploration, multiple-view environment sensing). An extensive experimental study validates our method and compares it with the full-informative case of bearing-plus-distance measurements. The results show that the proposed localization system exhibits an accuracy commensurate to our previous method [1] which uses bearing-plus-distance information."

A method to perform collision tests based on images taken from several stationary cameras in the work cell is presented.

1629777,22736,23735,Study on rotational and unclogging motions of magnetic chain-like microrobot,2014,"Abstract Magnetic microrobotics was nowadays one of themost advanced technique to reach deep locations in humanbody for future biomedical applications. Different magneticmicrorobot designs were proposed, such as bead pulling ormicroswimmers. In this paper, the use of chain-like of magneticN -microspheres was investigated to enable new kind of motionsand applications. An accurate theoretical model of chain-likemagnetic microbeads navigating in viscous uidic environmentsis described. Thus, the behavior of such microrobot wasanalyzed for different number of microspheres (ranging fromN = 2 to 5). The efciency of the proposed technique wasdemonstrated experimentally in a microuidic vessel phantomto mimic atherosclerosis disease leading to plaque formationthat fully occluded a vasculature. I. INTRODUCTIONDesign of integrated devices with electrical, mechanical,chemical or biological components at microscale enablesnumerous opportunities to improve on broad range of appli-cations of technology, science and medicine [1]. In particular,it is well established that such microsystem can be used inmany biomedical applications including minimally invasivesurgical procedures [2]. Hence, when these microrobots arepropelled in uidic environments, especially in the bloodcirculatory system, a very large number of remote locationsin the human body become accessible. Although there aredifferent actuation methods proposed in the literature, theuse of external magnetic elds has many advantages thatcircumvent the need for delivering power to the device andensuring autonomous untethered motion of the microrobot[1]. Indeed, it has been shown that the coils of a clinical MRIsystem can be used to control untethered magnetic beads in3D directions [3]. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to over-come some MRI-based navigation constraints (eg. pulsatileow, variation of time-multiplexed sequence parameters,duty cycle of the propulsion gradients, and repetition timeof the tracking sequence, availability, etc.) [4]. To overcomethese limitations, several magnetic propulsion mainly basedon the induction of magnetic force and torque. As example,different magnetic microrobot designs are proposed in theliterature based on biologically inspired motion, such as heli-cal microswimmer [5], or beating agella microswimmer [6].Such conguration is suitable in arterioles and capillaries [7],or for small swimmers size [8].

It is signicant that the robot can grasp assembly partsand do some simple in-hand manipulation so as to t themwith the package slots. In this research, we study the processof precise in-hand posture transition problem using a noveljaw like gripper with human-sized anthropomorphic features.We transform the in-hand manipulation problem into a seriesof static grasping problems. Then we study the successfultwisting condition on each grasp frame by analyzing its dynamicperformance and requirements. Based on this data-drivenidea, simulation and experimental data is obtained from bothsuccessful and failed trials. Finally, we create the distributionof parameters grasp map for successful twisting. I. INTRODUCTIONCurrently in robotic assembly cell for exible manufactur-ing industry, there still remains many other unsolved issuesfor robots. One is that the robot cannot work efcientlyto deal with assembly parts with complicated shapes. Theyoften rely on external sensor systems to help with theassembly work [1]. On the other side, human workers areskilled in performing complicated tasks by hands, inspiredby which, it seems essential that the conventional roboticmanipulator is able to perform complicated manipulation likehuman worker does. Therefore, researchers tend to improvethe capacity of robots by designing various functional end-effectors (hands) for robots.In order to meet industrial application requirements, therobotic hands must be inexpensive, compact, low weightand robust. It also must be capable of performing simplegrasping and manipulation tasks, such as precision ma-nipulation, in-hand grasp transitions, and sufciently generalto manipulate different objects and tools. From previous re-searches, grippers are categorized in four groups: Impactive,Ingressive, Astrictive and Contigutive [3]. The majority ofindustrial grippers are either impactive or astrictive. Due topresent, most robotic hands in both industrial and academicworlds are either few actuators powered jaws, or simpliedhuman hand shape liked multi-ngered hands.

The composite is formed by suspending magnetite particles (Fe 3 O 4 ) in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). In order to obtain precise and complicated pattern of micromagnetic tools, a photolithography techniques has been applied by making good use of thick KMPR-1050 photoresist as sacrificed mould. The surface of the produced micromagnetic tools is specially coated in order to suppress stiction in the biochip. The novelties of these tools are (1) fabrication of any 2D shape, (2) softness (harmless to cells), (3) no contact actuation (no stiction), 4. mass production with low cost. Here we have demonstrated that the mass-produced versatile micromagnetic tools such as stirrer and valve.

It discusses this using contrasting case studies based on the analysis of explicitation interviews with three participants.

In order to obtain precise and complicated three dimensional patterns of magnetically driven 3D microtools, a grayscale photolithography technique has been applied by making good use of thick nega-photoresist as sacrificed mold. By controlling an amount of ultraviolet light with a gradation of gray tone mask, we have fabricated smoothly curved (100 mum gap) object without steps which tend to be appeared in case of conventional layer by layer photolithography techniques. A wide range of on-chip application of microactuators can be proposed by using a softness of polymer-based 3D MMT. For example, microrotor was operated as miromixer and micropump, also microloader was actuated by the magnetic and fluidic force. The surface of the 3D MMT was fabricated with a group of spiked pattern to reduce the contact area between PDMS (poly dimethyl siloxane) microchannel and PDMS-based 3D MMT. The produced 3D MMT can be applied to complicated on-chip manipulations of sensitive materials such as cells."
2203383,22736,65,Evaluation of action-similarity awareness effect in rhythm ensemble co-creation,2011,"There are many robots which have communication skills with human but most of their actions and responses are preprogrammed and few researches inspect psychological aspects of behavior in human-robot co-creation. In this paper, we focus on action-similarity awareness as a key for building up co-creative relationship with humans. Here, action-similarity awareness means that one recognizes affinity to one's own actions derived from other's actions. As a simple task involving action-similarity awareness, we focused on rhythm ensemble. The ensemble is a type of drumming session in which even people who have little musical experience easily take part. In this research we expect to realize the awareness in the rhythm ensemble session by employing the other's past action and mixing it to metrical structure, a basic beat structure in music. To make sure of this idea in real session, we developed a robot system which can actually play a drumming session with humans and control action-similarity awareness. We conducted a subjective experiment and analyzed questionnaire and interaction record. From the questionnaire results, it was confirmed that the sense of prediction increases with action contributing rate and that it is effective to imitate humans actions and add 10% to 30% originality. From the interaction record it was confirmed that phrase structure was shared by making consent on which part to be varied or fixed."

In this work the flight mechanism that gains thrust by rotating magnetic wings in an alternating magnetic field is proposed. Micro-sized models whose wings are around 1 mm long were fabricated using MEMS technology. The wings are made of electroplated nickel or cobalt-nickel alloy, and a thin glass rod is attached to the center as an axis of rotation. The glass rod is inserted into a small glass tube which works as an outer bearing. The 0.9 mm long microwings which weigh about 0.165 mg succeed in taking off at a rotating frequency of 570 Hz. It is estimated that 1.2 mm long micro-wings can lift up 0.6 mg at a rotating frequency of 600 Hz.

2950569,22736,23735,Development of a spherical tether-handling device with a coupled differential mechanism for tethered teleoperated robots,2016,"Tethered robots often experience entangling of their cables with obstacles in uncertain disaster environments. This paper proposes a spherical tether handling device that unfastens a robot's tether during surveys by releasing the tether and carrying it aside. By using a differential mechanism, the device drives shells and rollers that hold the tether. On flat surfaces, the device moves forward by driving the shells. When the device climbs over steps, the rollers are driven by the differential mechanism to pull the tether automatically. After prototyping the device, we confirm the surmountability of the proposed device against steps. The results show that the device can climb a height 90.9% of its diameter. We also demonstrate a scenario to handle the tether and untangle multiple tangles in an environment with several obstacles."
1881363,22736,20332,Design and implementation of two-level synchronization for interactive music robot,2010,"Our goal is to develop an interactive music robot, i.e., a robot that presents a musical expression together with humans. A music interaction requires two important functions: synchronization with the music and musical expression, such as singing and dancing. Many instrument-performing robots are only capable of the latter function, they may have difficulty in playing live with human performers. The synchronization function is critical for the interaction. We classify synchronization and musical expression into two levels: (1) the rhythm level and (2) the melody level. Two issues in achieving two-layer synchronization and musical expression are: (1) simultaneous estimation of the rhythm structure and the current part of the music and (2) derivation of the estimation confidence to switch behavior between the rhythm level and the melody level. This paper presents a score following algorithm, incremental audio to score alignment, that conforms to the two-level synchronization design using a particle filter. Our method estimates the score position for the melody level and the tempo for the rhythm level. The reliability of the score position estimation is extracted from the probability distribution of the score position. Experiments are carried out using polyphonic jazz songs. The results confirm that our method switches levels in accordance with the difficulty of the score estimation. When the tempo of the music is less than 120 (beats per minute; bpm), the estimated score positions are accurate and reported; when the tempo is over 120 (bpm), the system tends to report only the tempo to suppress the error in the reported score position predictions."
701404,22736,20524,FLYAQ: Enabling Non-expert Users to Specify and Generate Missions of Autonomous Multicopters,2015,"Multicopters are increasingly popular since they promise to simplify a myriad of everyday tasks. Currently, vendors provide low-level APIs and basic primitives to program multicopters, making mission development a task-specific and error-prone activity. As a consequence, current approaches are affordable only for users that have a strong technical expertise. Then, software engineering techniques are needed to support the definition, development, and realization of missions at the right level of abstraction and involving teams of autonomous multicopters that guarantee the safety today's users expect. In this paper we describe a tool that enables end-users with no technical expertise, e.g., firefighters and rescue workers, to specify missions for a team of multicopters. The detailed flight plan that each multicopter must perform to accomplish the specified mission is automatically generated by preventing collisions between multicopters and obstacles, and ensuring the preservation of no-fly zones."

3008223,22736,10174,Task and motion policy synthesis as liveness games,2016,"We present a novel and scalable policy synthesis approach for robots. Rather than producing single-path plans for a static environment, we consider changing environments with uncontrollable agents, where the robot needs a policy to respond correctly over the infinite-horizon interaction with the environment. Our approach operates on task and motion domains, and combines actions over discrete states with continuous, collision-free paths. We synthesize a task and motion policy by iteratively generating a candidate policy and verifying its correctness. For efficient policy generation, we use grammars for potential policies to limit the search space and apply domain-specific heuristics to generalize verification failures, providing stricter constraints on policy candidates. For efficient policy verification, we construct compact, symbolic constraints for valid policies and employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to check the validity of these constraints. Furthermore, the SMT solver enables quantitative specifications such as energy limits. The results show that our approach offers better scalability compared to a state-of-the-art policy synthesis tool in the tested benchmarks and demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup from our heuristics for the tested mobile manipulation domain."

The replanner alters the reference generator's output in the face of unanticipated disturbances that drive up the tracking error. We demonstrate that the new reference generator cannot destabilize the tracker, that tracking errors converge in the absence of disturbance, and that the overall coupled reference-tracker system cannot be destabilized by disturbances of bounded energy. We report the results of simulation studies exploring the performance of this new design applied to a two dimensional point mass particle interacting with fixed but unknown terrain obstacles."
2486289,22736,65,Experimental analysis of dominance in haptic collaboration,2009,"Recent research focuses on developing robots that are meant to be partners of humans instead of pure machines. This makes enhanced communication necessary. Especially in scenarios embedding physical interaction between the two partners dominance is an urgent matter. To overcome one-sided dominance as in passive following or trajectory replay in favor of intuitive collaboration, human-human collaboration and the involved dominance distribution needs to be addressed. Even though some attempts are reported in literature, to our best knowledge no experimental analysis of dominance distribution in a kinesthetic task reports actual values of dominance. Therefore, the current paper discusses dominance measures appropriate in haptic interaction and investigates the dominance distribution in a tracking-task experiment. In the analysis we focus on the influence of mutual haptic feedback between the partners on dominance distribution by contrasting this condition to vision-only partner feedback trials. Furthermore, this paper investigates the consistency of dominance behavior across different partners based on methodologies transferred from social psychology. Results show that participants work with a dominance distribution, whereby the feedback condition does not effect this distribution. A high amount of variability in individual dominance behavior can be considered person dependent. Here, feedback has an effect as the dominance behavior is even more stable across partners when mutual haptic feedback is provided."

12597,22736,22113,Robotic perception of material,1995,"In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework in which acts of manipulation are undertaken for the sake of perceiving material. Within this framework, we disambiguate different materials by actively contacting and probing them, and by sensing the resulting forces, displacements, and sounds. We report experimental results from four separate implementations of this framework using a variety of sensory modalities, including force, vision, and audition. For each implementation, we identify sensor-derived measures that are diagnostic of material properties, and use those measures to categorize objects by their material class. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the issue of shape-in variance is of critical importance for future work."
66777,22736,20332,On the qualitative structure of a mechanical assembly,1992,"A mechanical assembly is usually described by the geometry of its parts and the spatial relations defining their positions. This model does not directly provide the information needed to reason about assembly and disassembly motions. We propose another representation, the non-directional blocking graph, which describes the qualitative internal structure of the assembly. This representation makes explicit how the parts prevent each other from being moved in every possible direction of motion. It derives from the observation that the infinite set of motion directions can be partitioned into a finite arrangement of subsets such that over each subset the interferences among the parts remain qualitatively the same. We describe how this structure can be efficiently computed from the geometric model of the assembly. The (dis)assembly motions considered include infinitesimal and extended translations in two and three dimensions, and infinitesimal rigid motions."

We provide the information of the gaze target intuitively to human based on the shared attention with the emotional communication robot Kamin-FA1. The robot has a facial expression function using a curved surface display. We examined the effect of emotional expression to the gaze guidance in terms of the reliability and the reaction speed. We conducted the experiments of gaze measurement during the gaze guidance with emotional expression to evaluate the role of emotional expression. The results of the gaze guidance experiments showed that the gaze guidance with emotional expression caused more reliable and quick eye movement than that without emotional expression. Specially, the expression of surprise has the best performance in the gaze guidance among the six basic emotions."

More than 240 sets of place and task were identified in the results of two versions of the web-based questionnaires. The results suggest that the household, workplace, and working surface are, respectively, the three most-mentioned places for robotic arm usage in daily life, that participants who were from different countries but were familiar with information technology did not show significant differences in their answers, and that females showed more interest in household and self-care tasks.

This paper presents a method for the generation of animal gait in quadrupedal robots. In this study, we employed AIBO as an experimental quadrupedal robot and generated the gait of the robot on the basis of an animal's gait. First, we optimized the mono-leg orbit, which can efficiently output a propulsive force, by imitating a dog's gait using a genetic algorithm. Moreover, we generated the quadrupedal gait of AIBO using both the optimum orbit of the mono-leg and an animal's gait, classified as the gait of a walking dog based on zoology. Furthermore, we administered a questionnaire study to determine subjective human feelings to choose the best gait for AIBO from among the various gaits mentioned above. Finally, minor deviation of parameters for each joint was corrected to realize the stable gait on the ground."
2935739,22736,9475,Stochastic behavior of robots that navigate by interacting with their environment,2016,"This paper reports on the benefit of including boundary interaction behaviors, specifically wall-following, in reducing the position uncertainty of mobile robots with little or no localization capacity. Assuming that the robot has some primitive wall-following capabilities, and can switch its behavior depending on whether it moves in free-space or along obstacle boundaries, the time evolution of its trajectories is modeled by a stochastic differential equation with piece-wise constant drift and diffusion terms. The probability law of this piece-wise linear time-invariant diffusion is matched at any given time instant by that of an appropriately constructed single diffusion, in what is called here a time-weighted convolution. Since the Fokker-Planck associated with the single diffusion can be solved analytically, this matching enables the exact calculation of the position distribution of the stochastic switching vehicle dynamics at any given stopping time."

Building on our work, we optimize stochastic control policies for the robots that cause the population to quickly redistribute among the sites while adhering to a limit on inter-site traffic at equilibrium. We propose a way to account for delays due to navigation between sites in our controller synthesis procedure. Control policies that are designed with and without the use of delay statistics are compared for a simulation in which 240 robots distribute themselves among four buildings."
2924011,22736,21106,A theory of active object localization,2009,"We present some theoretical results related to the problem of actively searching for a target in a 3D environment, under the constraint of a maximum search time. We define the object localization problem as the maximization over the search region of the Lebesgue integral of the scene structure probabilities. We study variants of the problem as they relate to actively selecting a finite set of optimal viewpoints of the scene for detecting and localizing an object. We do a complexity-level analysis and show that the problem variants are NP-Complete or NP-Hard. We study the tradeoffs of localizing vs. detecting a target object, using single-view and multiple-view recognition, under imperfect dead-reckoning and an imperfect recognition algorithm. These results motivate a set of properties that efficient and reliable active object localization algorithms should satisfy."
1416735,22736,65,Further Experiments to Investigate the Influence of Robot Motions on Human Impressions,2006,"This paper investigates human impressions of the robot's reaching motion based on psychophysiological experiments. There has been an increasing development of robots that move in the immediate vicinity of humans. It is important to ensure the security and relief of humans in the presence of robots. In our previous works, we employed heart rate variabilities, skin potential responses, and skin conductance responses (SCR) to investigate the influence of robot motion on human impressions. The results of several experiments showed that there was a modality effect, that is, the blocking out of the actuation noise and sight coming from robots tended to decrease the sympathetic nerve system (SNS) response. In this paper, we performed further experiments to investigate the modality effect and the long-term effect on human impressions based on SCR analysis and subjective ratings. The long-term effect implied a variation of response to robot motion over a long period. When the same stimuli are presented to humans, their responses to the stimuli tend to attenuate gradually. This phenomenon is known as habituation. In our experimentation (Hanajima et al., 2005), the subjects were asked to engage in two successive sets of the experiment for two months. We found two kinds of habituation in the data, the variation in a day and the variation between days. We defined the short-term variation as the former and the long-term variation as the latter. By comparing them, the long-term effect was investigated. As a result, we confirmed the same modality effect as illustrated in previous works. We also observed significant differences in the short-term and long-term variation from the SCR analysis. In the analysis of subjective ratings, the significant difference in the long-term variation was observed in more subjects than in the short-term variation. This suggested that the negative mental impression of the subjects to robot motion decreased as time passed"
3017420,22736,10174,Robot Motion Planning for Pouring Liquids.,2016,"We present a new algorithm to compute a collision-free trajectory for a robot manipulator to pour liquid from one container to the other.  Our formulation uses a physical fluid model to predicate its highly deformable motion. We present simulation guided and optimization based method to automatically compute the transferring trajectory. Instead of abstract or simplified liquid models, we use the full-featured and accurate Navier-Stokes model that provides the fine-grained information of velocity distribution inside the liquid body. Moreover, this information is used as an additional guiding energy term for the planner. One of our key contributions  is the tight integration between the fine-grained fluid simulator, liquid transfer controller, and the optimization-based planner.  We have implemented the method using hybrid particle-mesh fluid simulator (FLIP) and demonstrated its performance on 4 benchmarks, with different cup shapes and viscosity coefficients."
2397551,22736,9080,Cooperative self-organization in a heterogeneous swarm robotic system,2010,"We study how a swarm robotic system consisting of two different types of robots can solve a foraging task. The first type of robots are small wheeled robots, called foot-bots, and the second type are flying robots that can attach to the ceiling, called eye-bots. While the foot-bots perform the actual foraging, i.e. they move back and forth between a source and a target location, the eye-bots are deployed in stationary positions against the ceiling, with the goal of guiding the foot-bots. The key component of our approach is a process of mutual adaptation, in which foot-bots execute instructions given by eye-bots, and eye-bots observe the behavior of foot-bots to adapt the instructions they give. Through a simulation study, we show that this process allows the system to find a path for foraging in a cluttered environment. Moreover, it is able to converge onto the shortest of two paths, and spread over different paths in case of congestion. Since our approach involves mutual adaptation between two sub-swarms of different robots, we refer to it as cooperative self-organization. This is to our knowledge the first work that investigates such a system in swarm robotics."

This paper is concerned with the control for maintaining the high stability of the swarm, and proposes a control algorithm for the robotic swarm in obstacle space. In this paper, the robotic swarm which includes whole robots is defined as a whole swarm. In addition, each robot with neighboring robots forms a local swarm that overlapped the other ones partially, so a robot can belong to some local swarms. The proposed algorithm for overcoming above problems is based on the center of gravity of the local swarm which attracts the robot of it, and is applied to the omni-directional mobile robots. It is confirmed that the effectiveness about maintaing the stability of the swarm through simulations using ODE (open dynamics engine)."
2000885,22736,9078,Speeding up SSD planar tracking by pixel selection,2002,"Tracking planar patches is a subject of interest in computer vision. We present a method to estimate, in real-time, the position and orientation of a previously viewed planar patch. The algorithm is based on minimising the sum of squared differences (SSD) between a selected set of pixels obtained from a previously stored image of the patch and the current image of it. First a linear model for projectively tracking a planar patch is introduced; then, a procedure to accelerate the tracking process is presented. This procedure is based on using a small set of informative points in the tracking process. In experiments, we show the gain in performance and compare different procedures for selecting the set of points used in tracking."
1781886,22736,9475,On the general characteristics of 2D optimal obstacle-field guidance solution,2009,"This paper presents a computational framework of partitioning a dynamical system's free space in a way such that global optimality can be guaranteed by composing control policies over a local region. Unlike traditional triangulation methods, the partition method in this paper takes into account the topological layout, as well as the vehicle dynamics. With this framework, we show that spatial, dynamic behavior governed by optimality has an underlying structure, which reflect the spatio-dynamic dependency. This structure provides a basis for abstraction which is useful for the type of high level planning and reasoning that is needed for autonomous vehicle guidance. In this paper we focuses on a Dubins' vehicle motion model. Such a model is adequate for aircraft operating at a constant speed. Although restrictive, the insights and conclusions about this kind of vehicle can serve as basis for investigating more general systems."
2924059,22736,30,Development of a finger-like mechanism of end-effector for micro surgery,2016,"Neurosurgery had been considered nearly impossible due to its technical difficulty and the danger to its special target organ, but with endoscopic methods, many such surgeries can be made safely through the nose. Endoscopic neurosurgery is limited by available instruments, however, and there remain some areas of the human body inaccessible to standard surgical tools. To overcome some of these limitations, in this study we developed a simple mechanism that could form a high curvature in a narrow space. The end product is a finger-like mechanism consisting of five body parts and four joints. All body parts are connected in series, having a total length of 20mm and a diameter of ϕ4mm. A four-bar linkage internally connects the body parts and joints, and a nitinol backbone was used to improve repeatability. The first joint is driven by a rod or wire, and the shape of the mechanism is determined by rotating the first joint, because the position of each joint depends on the position of the joint before it. The study verified that an image sensor in the end of the finger-like mechanism has a wider range of view, 210 degrees than a conventional endoscope of 100 degrees. Finally, skull model simulation suggests that this device could be used in real neurosurgical applications."

Specifically, the effects of team size on the evolution of the robots are studied. The study of team sizes deals with finding an ideal number of robots to collectively perform the surveillance task of a given region. In addition, controllers for evolved robot teams are tested in teams of different sizes to determine if the results can be generalized. In addition, statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the evolved results."
2412382,22736,9616,An Efficient Text Capture Method for Moving Robots Using DCT Feature and Text Tracking,2006,"When a moving robot tries to find text in the surrounding scene by an onboard video camera, the same text strings appear in many image frames. Since it is a waste of time to recognize the same text strings repeatedly, it is necessary to decrease text candidate regions for recognition. This paper presents a text capture system that can look around the environment by an active camera, reducing the number of text strings to be recognized. The text candidate regions are extracted from the images by an improved DCT feature. The text regions are tracked in a video sequence to reduce the text candidate strings. In experiments, we tested 55 images of corridor with seven text strings. The text candidate regions are reduced by 86.8% by our method."
1960080,22736,65,Robot action generator using reusable motion modules,2005,"This paper introduces software which enables us to create robot control programs easily and intuitively. Robot control programs are generally difficult to develop because the development requires special knowledge on robotics, such as kinematics and dynamics. On the other hand, robot actions, whether simple ones or complex ones, are usually described as a series of basic robot motions. So the software developed by the authors implements such basic motions as built-in modules and provides a GUI to develop complex actions from them. The software also provides a function to store such complex actions in some persistent storage for later reuse. This paper presents details of the software and gives some experimental results."
202233,22736,11187,Learning Sensorimotor Transformations with Dynamic Neural Fields,2013,"The sensorimotor maps link the perceived states to actions, required to achieve the goals of a behaving agent. These mappings depend on the physics of the body of the agent, as well as the dynamics and geometry of the environment, in which the behavior unfolds. Autonomous acquisition and updating of the mappings is crucial for robust behavior in a changing real-world environment. Autonomy of many architectures, which implement the learning and adaptation of sensorimotor maps, is limited. Here, we present a neural-dynamic architecture that enables autonomous learning of the sensorimotor transformation, involved in looking behavior. The architecture is built using Dynamic Neural Fields and is implemented on a robotic agent that consists of an eDVS sensor on a pan-tilt unit."
1063663,22736,9475,Dynamic response characteristics of a two-wheeled inverted-pendulum transporter,2013,"Two-wheeled inverted pendulums can be used as personal transporters. Their maneuverability and small footprint give them desirable properties for this application. However, they are intrinsically unstable and their dynamic response can be significantly different depending on what type of person is riding the transporter. Therefore, the feedback controller that stabilizes the machine must be robust to these dynamic variations. In this paper, dynamic characteristics of a Segway i2 are investigated. The variation in the dynamic properties as a function of the rider parameters of weight and center of mass height is reported. It is shown that the pitching frequency changes significantly as a function of rider weight and center of mass height."
1995696,22736,65,A probabilistic approach for attention-based multi-modal human-robot interaction,2009,The interaction between a robot and a human becomes meaningful when the robotic agent possesses some level of human-like cognition. This paper proposes an attention-based approach for multi-modal HRI. The core of the proposed approach is a bio-inspired artificial model of visual attention which enables a robot to focus on the visually salient and/or behaviorally relevant stimuli in the surrounding. The attention model provides the human partner with the opportunity to manipulate the attention behavior of the robot through natural speech command. Similarly the robot is able to manipulate the attention of the human partner using its actuators. Thus the bio-inspired visual attention mechanism along with the sensors and actuators enables the robot to establish joint attention with the human partner. Formation of this joint attention is the basis for further human-robot interaction. Experimental results validate different aspects of the proposed attention-based HRI framework.
107436,22736,20332,Biped walk learning through playback and corrective demonstration,2010,"Developing a robust, flexible, closed-loop walking algorithm for a humanoid robot is a challenging task due to the complex dynamics of the general biped walk. Common analytical approaches to biped walk use simplified models of the physical reality. Such approaches are partially successful as they lead to failures of the robot walk in terms of unavoidable falls. Instead of further refining the analytical models, in this work we investigate the use of human corrective demonstrations, as we realize that a human can visually detect when the robot may be falling. We contribute a two-phase biped walk learning approach, which we experiment on the Aldebaran NAO humanoid robot. In the first phase, the robot walks following an analytical simplified walk algorithm, which is used as a black box, and we identify and save a walk cycle as joint motion commands. We then show how the robot can repeatedly and successfully play back the recorded motion cycle, even if in open-loop. In the second phase, we create a closed-loop walk by modifying the recorded walk cycle to respond to sensory data. The algorithm learns joint movement corrections to the open-loop walk based on the corrective feedback provided by a human, and on the sensory data, while walking autonomously. In our experimental results, we show that the learned closed-loop walking policy outperforms a hand-tuned closed-loop policy and the open-loop playback walk, in terms of the distance traveled by the robot without falling."
395128,22736,20332,Spatial representation and reasoning for human-robot collaboration,2007,"How should a robot represent and reason about spatial information when it needs to collaborate effectively with a human? The form of spatial representation that is useful for robot navigation may not be useful in higher-level reasoning or working with humans as a team member. To explore this question, we have extended previous work on how children and robots learn to play hide and seek to a human-robot team covertly approaching a moving target. We used the cognitive modeling system, ACT-R, with an added spatial module to support the robot's spatial reasoning. The robot interacted with a team member through voice, gestures, and movement during the team's covert approach of a moving target. This paper describes the new robotic system and its integration of metric, symbolic, and cognitive layers of spatial representation and reasoning for its individual and team behavior."
441039,22736,9704,Efficiency energy on humanoid robot walking using evolutionary algorithm,2015,"One of the problems in humanoid locomotion generation is energy efficiency. This paper proposes a method for energy efficiency optimization in simple humanoid robot locomotion using single objective genetic algorithm. With the aim to produce walking trajectory system using minimum energy and good stabilization, torque and oscillation analysis are required to calculate the stabilization. The number of desired outputs in this system is 4 parameters and the number of inputs is 9 parameters. We used neural network with back propagation learning mechanism to realize the relationship between input and output data as well as producing fitness function for genetic algorithm. The trajectory system has 2 trajectory equations, which is pelvis trajectory and ankle trajectory. Ankle trajectory is formed from circle function in Cartesian coordinate space and pelvis trajectory is formed from third order polynomial equation. Both of them are influenced by inclination of robot body. In the experiment, we apply this system using Bioloid robot with inertial sensor already installed. The experimental results show the analysis of energy by observing the torque resulted by servomotor in each joint. We observe that using this system, the torque value resulted by servomotors was decreased and has good stabilization."
996414,22736,65,Pedestrian-inspired sampling-based multi-robot collision avoidance,2012,"We present a distributed collision avoidance algorithm for multiple mobile robots that is model-predictive, sampling-based, and intuitive for operation around humans. Unlike purely reactive approaches, the proposed algorithm incorporates arbitrary trajectories as generated by a motion planner running on each navigating robot as well as predicted human trajectories. Our approach, inspired by human navigation in crowded pedestrian environments, draws from the sociology literature on pedestrian interaction. We propose a simple two-phase algorithm in which agents initially cooperate to avoid each other and then initiate civil inattention, thus lessening reactivity and committing to a trajectory. This process entails a pedestrian bargain in which all agents act competently to avoid each other and, once resolution is achieved, to avoid interfering with others' planned trajectories. This approach, being human-inspired, fluidly permits navigational interaction between humans and robots. We report experimental results for the algorithm running on real robots with and without human presence and in simulation."
597660,22736,21106,Using a connected filter for structure estimation in perspective systems,2006,"Three-dimensional structure information can be estimated from two-dimensional perspective images using recursive estimation methods. This paper investigates possibilities to improve structure filter performance for a certain class of stochastic perspective systems by utilizing mutual information, in particular when each observed point on a rigid object is affectd by the same process noise. After presenting the dynamic system of interest, the method is applied, using an extended Kalman filter for the estimation, to a simulated time-varying multiple point vision system. The performance of a connected filter is compared, using Monte Carlo methods, to that of a set of independent filters. The idea is then further illustrated and analyzed by means of a simple linear system. Finally more formal stochastic differential equation aspects, especially the impact of transformations in the Ito sense, are discussed and related to physically realistic noise models in vision systems."
2355001,22736,8502,Context-aware search using cooperative agents in a smart environment,2009,"In this paper we present the design of a decentralized vision-based object search system that can be used for el- der care in a smart environment. In our approach, each autonomous search agent maintains separate estimates of the probability density function (PDF) of the object location and makes independent decisions about its search process. Asynchronous cooperative search is achieved by transmit- ting perceptual information among the agents. Our work also investigates how context such as the detection history and density of activity by people influence the estimation of the prior PDF of the target and the use of this information to improve the search efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative search strategy is efficient and the methods we use to incorporate contextual information into the target's posterior PDF can improve the efficiency further."
103038,22736,20332,Investigating Neglect Benevolence and Communication Latency During Human-Swarm Interaction,2012,"In practical applications of robot swarms with bio-inspired behaviors, a human operator will need to exert control over the swarm to fulfill the mission objectives. In many operational settings, human operators are remotely located and the communication environment is harsh. Hence, there exists some latency in information (or control command) transfer between the human and the swarm. In this paper, we conduct experiments of human-swarm interaction to investigate the effects of communication latency on the performance of a human-swarm system in a swarm foraging task. We develop and investigate the concept of neglect benevolence, where a human operator allows the swarm to evolve on its own and stabilize before giving new commands. Our experimental results indicate that operators exploited neglect benevolence in different ways to develop successful strategies in the foraging task. Furthermore, we show experimentally that the use of a predictive display can help mitigate the adverse effects of communication latency."
2047951,22736,9704,Applying evolution strategies for biped locomotion learning in RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation,2011,"This paper addresses parameter tuning methods for bipedal locomotion of a humanoid model in the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation environment. A gait pattern of this humanoid is generated by a desired foot trajectory, joint control systems and nonlinear oscillators. To build a good gait pattern, the parameters of the walking system should be adjusted suitably. In this paper, a usage of evolution strategies that is depending on only a performance evaluation of the robot, is considered for adjusting the parameters. We apply two type evolution strategies in order to tune the parameters. The one is an evolution strategy with mask operation where the portion of individual to avoid mutation. The other is a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Numerical simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches by using the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulator."
2377237,22736,65,Using pressure sensors to identify manipulation actions during human physical interaction,2015,"This paper presents an investigation of human physical interaction. In particular, we describe how data from pressure sensors mounted on a glove worn by a human can be mapped to manipulation actions; the actions can in turn be used to interpret physical interaction during elderly care. The work is part of the RoboHelper project, which aims to build a multimodal communication interface for assistive robots for the elderly. Human-human physical interaction during elderly care and in a realistic setting is studied in this work with the aim of using the learned insights to develop corresponding robot interfaces. The contribution of this work is the identification of various types of physical manipulation actions that take place when an elder is assisted in performing activities of daily living in a natural setting. As part of the RoboHelper project, it has been shown that the knowledge of actions involving physical manipulation of objects helps in understanding the spoken language. More specifically, it improves the resolution of third person pronouns/deictic words and the classification of dialogue acts. In this work we show that pressure sensor data can be used to automatically recognize such physical manipulation actions. The automatic recognition of physical manipulation actions may facilitate future studies of multimodal interaction by greatly reducing the time required for manual annotations. It is also useful for learning from demonstration, a popular approach in human-robot interaction research."
2513358,22736,23735,Experiments in distributed locomotion with a unit-compressible modular robot,2002,"Effective algorithms for modular self-reconfiguring robots should be distributed and parallel. In previous work, we explored general algorithms for locomotion and self-replication and their instantiations to systems in which modules move over the surface of the robot. In this work, we present several algorithms applied to the Crystal robot-two new distributed locomotion algorithms designed specifically for unit-compressible actuation, as well as the adaptation of a generic division algorithm to the Crystal. We also present the integration of a locomotion algorithm with a distributed goal recognition algorithm developed previously. This allows the robot to reconfigure and recognize the achievement of its goal, all without the use of a central controller. We have instantiated all of these algorithms on the Crystal hardware, and we present results of our experiments. These experiments empirically verify the utility of our distributed algorithms on a self-reconfiguring system."
2200400,22736,65,Usability evaluation with different viewpoints of a Human-Swarm interface for UAVs control in formation,2015,"A common way to organize a high number of robots, both when moving autonomously and when controlled by a human operator, is to let them move in formation. This is a principle that takes inspiration from the nature, that maximizes the possibility of monitoring the environment and therefore of anticipating risks and finding targets. In robotics, alongside these reasons, the organization of a robot team in a formation allows a human operator to deal with a high number of agents in a simpler way, moving the swarm as a single entity. In this context, the typology of visual feedback is fundamental for a correct situational awareness, but in common practice having an optimal camera configuration is not always possible. Usually human operators use cameras on board the multirotors, with an egocentric point of view, while it is known that in mobile robotics overall awareness and pattern recognition are optimized by exocentric views. In this article we present an analysis of the performance achieved by human operators controlling a swarm of UAVs in formation, accomplishing different tasks and using different point of views. The control architecture is implemented in a ROS framework and interfaced with a 3D simulation environment. Experimental tests show a degradation of performance while using egocentric cameras with respect of an exocentric point of view, although cameras on board the robots allow to satisfactorily accomplish simple tasks."

The algorithm is based on minimising the sum of squared differences between a previously stored image of the patch and the current image of it. First a linear model for projectively tracking a planar patch is introduced, then a method to compute the 3D position and orientation of the patch in 3D space is presented. In the experiments conducted we show that this method is adequate for tracking not only planar objects, but also non planar objects with limited out-of-plane rotations, as is the case of face tracking."
1927649,22736,9475,PID switching control for a highway estimation and tracking applied on a convertible mini-UAV,2012,"This paper reports current work on development and navigation control of an experimental prototype of a new tilt-rotor convertible aircraft (Quad-plane Mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The goal of the work consists of estimating and tracking a road using a vision system, without any previous knowledge of the road, as well as developing an efficient controller for treat with situations when the road is not detected by the vision sensor. For dealing with this situation, we propose a switching control strategy applied in two operational regions: road detected and no road detected. The exponential stability is proved for the subsystem formed by the lateral position taking into account the switching boundaries between the operational regions. The control law is validated in the proposed platform, showing the expected behavior during autonomous navigation."
2625091,22736,20332,Knowledge Processing for Autonomous Robot Control,2012,"Successfully accomplishing everyday manipulation tasks requires robots to have substantial knowledge about the objects they interact with, the environment they operate in as well as about the properties and effects of the actions they perform. Often, this knowledge is implicitly contained in manually written control programs, which makes it hard for the robot to adapt to newly acquired information or to re-use knowledge in a different context. By explicitly representing this knowledge, control decisions can be formulated as inference tasks which can be sent as queries to a knowledge base. This allows the robot to take all information it has at query time into account to generate answers, leading to better flexibility, adaptability to changing situations, robustness, and the ability to re-use knowledge once acquired. In this paper, we report on our work towards a practical and grounded knowledge representation and inference system. The system is specifically designed to meet the challenges created by using knowledge processing techniques on autonomous robots, including specialized inference methods, grounding of symbolic knowledge in the robot’s control structures, and the acquisition of the different kinds of knowledge a robot needs."
1265968,22736,65,Navigating in populated environments by following a leader,2013,"Service robots have a great potential of improving human quality of life by aiding in everyday tasks. However, robots that share an environment and interact with humans still face some challenges that limits their acceptance. One of these challenges is how to move and behave among groups of people, which is a task performed seamlessly by humans and some animals. Motion planning in dynamic environments has been addressed mostly by predicting future position of humans and avoiding them. However, with the increase of the number of persons in such environments, techniques that are based only on the prediction of the movement of humans can fail, as they usually ignore the human's reaction to the presence of the robot. Instead of trying to model the complex human motion behavior, this work proposes to rely on humans to guide the robot through difficult situations, where modern approaches would fail to find a solution. This will be accomplished by a probabilistic approach for selecting a human leader, according to the robot's desired destination. In this way, the robot can take advantage of the humans' paths and behavior, effortlessly avoiding dynamic and static features together with the human leader, relieving the robot from the burden of having to generate its own path in difficult situations."
2985646,22736,9475,Non-myopic target tracking strategies for non-linear systems,2016,"We study the problem of devising a closed-loop strategy to control the position of a robot that is tracking a possibly moving target. The robot is capable of obtaining noisy measurements of the target's position. The key idea in active target tracking is to choose control laws that drive the robot to measurement locations that will reduce the uncertainty in the target's position. The challenge is that measurement uncertainty often is a function of the (unknown) relative positions of the target and the robot. Consequently, a closed-loop control policy is desired which can map the current estimate of the target's position to an optimal control law for the robot. Our main contribution is to devise a closed-loop control policy for target tracking that plans for a sequence of control actions, instead of acting greedily. We consider scenarios where the noise in measurement is a function of the state of the target. We seek to minimize the maximum uncertainty (trace of the posterior covariance matrix) over all possible measurements. We exploit the structural properties of a Kalman Filter to build a policy tree that is orders of magnitude smaller than naive enumeration while still preserving optimality guarantees. We show how to obtain even more computational savings by relaxing the optimality guarantees. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through simulations."

This paper describes some fundamental steps towards the real-time implementation of a system that allows a mobile robot to transform quantitative information about human trajectories (i.e. coordinates and speed) into qualitative concepts, and from these to generate appropriate control commands. The problem is formulated using a simple version of qualitative trajectory calculus, then solved using an inference engine based on fuzzy temporal logic and situation graph trees. Preliminary results are discussed and future directions of the current research are drawn."
3060030,22736,23735,A soft three axis force sensor useful for robot grippers,2016,"A novel three axis force sensor, based on magnetic flux measurements, was used in the fingers of a gripper. The force sensor uses three Hall Effect sensors orthogonally placed at the base of a hemisphere made of silicon rubber. A neodymium permanent magnet was inside the hemisphere. When a force was applied to the perimeter of hemisphere, it compressed the hemisphere displacing the magnet. This displacement caused change in the magnetic field around the Hall-effect sensors. By analysing these changes, we calculated the force in three directions using a lookup table. This sensor can be used in robot grippers to manipulate objects dexterously with tactile feedback. The cheap construction, robustness and reliability are few advantages of this sensor for it to be used in industrial applications. The sensor design, simulation and its characterization are presented in this work. Furthermore, as an application, a peg in a hole experiment was carried out to present the ability of the sensors to be used in robot grippers for manipulation tasks."

The present paper deals with the control of a lower limb orthosis applied at the knee joint level for rehabilitation purposes. A bounded control torque is developed in order to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the knee orthosis. The control law respects the physical constraints of the system. Moreover, it is robust with respect to external disturbances. The effectiveness of the control torque is tested in real-time using the EICOSI orthosis of the LISSI Lab."
2964087,22736,20332,Sparse latent space policy search,2016,"Computational agents often need to learn policies that involve many control variables, e.g., a robot needs to control several joints simultaneously. Learning a policy with a high number of parameters, however, usually requires a large number of training samples. We introduce a reinforcement learning method for sample-efficient policy search that exploits correlations between control variables. Such correlations are particularly frequent in motor skill learning tasks. The introduced method uses Variational Inference to estimate policy parameters, while at the same time uncovering a low-dimensional latent space of controls. Prior knowledge about the task and the structure of the learning agent can be provided by specifying groups of potentially correlated parameters. This information is then used to impose sparsity constraints on the mapping between the high-dimensional space of controls and a lower-dimensional latent space. In experiments with a simulated bi-manual manipulator, the new approach effectively identifies synergies between joints, performs efficient low-dimensional policy search, and outperforms state-of-the-art policy search methods."

The parameters used to control the robot are optimized using genetic algorithms (GA). Comparisons between different robot models and fi tness functions were accomplished, indicating how to compose a better multi-criterion fi tness function to be used in the gait control of legged robots. The best gait control solution and the best robot model were selected in order to help us to build a real robot. The results also showed that it is possible to generate stable gaits using GA in an ef fi cient manner."
2956553,22736,9475,Online optimal gait generation for bipedal walking robots using legendre pseudospectral optimization,2016,"This paper presents an optimal gait synthesis method that exploits the full body dynamics of robots using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD) control framework and—for the first time—experimentally realizes online HZD gait generation for a planar underactuated robot. Hybrid zero dynamics is an established theoretical framework that formally enables stable control of dynamic locomotion by enforcing virtual constraints through feedback controllers. An essential part of successfully realizing dynamic walking with HZD framework is determining parameters of the virtual constraints that satisfy hybrid invariant condition via nonlinear constrained optimization. Due to the complexity of the full hybrid system model of the robot, these optimization problems often suffer from slow convergence and local minima. In this paper, we improve the reliability of the HZD gait optimization and significantly increase the convergence speed by taking advantage of the direct transcription formulation and the exponential convergence of the global orthogonal collocation (a.k.a. pseudospectral) method. As a result, generating HZD gaits online becomes feasible with an average computation time less than 0.5 seconds, as will be demonstrated experimentally on a bipedal robot."
2354966,22736,9475,An optimization-based approach for design and analysis of stable 2.5D visual servoing under sensor and actuator constraints,2010,"In this paper, a 2.5D visual servoing controller is proposed that utilizes a Lyapunov based design method to drive the robot pose to a setpoint while satisfying constraints related to limited camera field-of-view and size of actuation. A nominal feedback controller is first introduced which is then modified through an optimization approach in order to satisfy the motion constraints. In the absence of actuator constraints, the proposed control law yields a semi-global asymptotic (exponential) stability result via a Lyapunov analysis. When actuator constraints are introduced, the result is local asymptotic stability with known bounds on the region of attraction. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the optimized visual servoing control strategy."
1419092,22736,65,Communication through physical interaction: A study of human collaborative manipulation of a planar object,2014,"In this paper we describe our progress towards understanding human communication through physical interaction. We describe a classification algorithm that can recognize four classes of actions that frequently occur during collaborative manipulation of planar objects. These actions were selected based on a user study involving dyads of elderly and care-giver in a realistic setting. Further user studies were conducted to collect the data necessary to develop the classification algorithm. As part of the data collection we also developed a sensory glove. The classification algorithm gives insight into human collaborative manipulation. More precisely, it identifies features in the data that are significant for classification. This information is particularly interesting as it only relies on physical aspects of the interaction and not on any particular sensor. As a result, the described work does not depend on any particular hardware and can be directly used by other researchers in human-robot interaction to develop further experiments and studies."
1344268,22736,9475,Invariance control with chattering reduction,2014,"In many control applications, state and/or output constraints need to be satisfied. For that purpose, artificial limits are imposed using a specially designed control law. Among other methods, invariance control has proven valuable for addressing the problem of state and output constraints in nonlinear control systems. However, invariance controlled systems often exhibit undesirable chattering behavior in particular in digital implementation. In this work, we propose a novel invariance-based control approach, which significantly reduces chattering. We give a condition for stability and restrictions on the admissible constraint configuration. The approach and the results are illustrated in simulations."

We focus on a service robot system for clearing a table as a human-friendly task. The task is composed of (1) target object detection, (2) the estimation of position and posture of the target objects, and (3) the clearing of the target object. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of estimating the position and posture of the target object based on Hough transform and steady-state genetic algorithm. Next, we define the perceptual index to evaluate the state of perception to specify the position and posture of target objects. Furthermore, we discuss the availability of the proposed perceptual index through preliminary experimental results."
2489209,22736,9475,Leader-following formation control of multiple vision-based autonomous robotic fish,2009,"A framework for the deployment of multiple autonomous robotic fish to achieve leader-following formations with Bezier trajectory is presented. Each follower robot estimates the position and orientation angle of its leader with a fast color-tracking vision system, and establishes a Bezier trajectory between its current position and the position of its leader robot. Considering the nonholonomic properties of the robotic fish, the optimization of Bezier curve's curvature to choose appropriate scale factor is conducted by combination of penalty function and one-dimensional search methods to perform a smooth and stable trajectory. The optimal trajectories are accurate enough to estimate the angular velocity of the follower robot, while a fuzzy controller is used to adjust its linear velocity. By the introduction of virtual leaders, formations of different shapes can be generated. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach."
2003584,22736,23735,Using the task function approach to avoid robot joint limits and kinematic singularities in visual servoing,1996,"We propose in this paper solutions to avoid robot joint limits and kinematic singularities in visual servoing. We use a control scheme based on the task function approach. It combines the regulation of the selected vision based task with the minimization of a secondary cost function, which reflects the manipulability of the robot in the vicinity of internal or external singularities. Several methods are proposed to avoid joint limits and a comparison between them is presented. We have demonstrated on various experiments the validity of our approach."
1091986,22736,9475,Double Exponential Smoothing for predictive vision based target tracking of a wheeled mobile robot,2013,This paper describes the design of a novel nonlinear kinematic controller which allows a wheeled mobile robot to track a moving target at a given separation distance. The Double Exponential Smoothing algorithm is employed to deal with uncertainties in the measurements and to acquire a predictive estimate for the robot's relative position. This estimate is used to automatically adjust the proportional gain of the controller in order to regulate the tracking error.
2823513,22736,65,Analysis of an adaptive strategy for equitably approaching and joining human interactions,2016,"Since social, assistive and companion robots need to navigate within human crowds, understanding spatial social conventions while designing navigation solutions for such robots is an essential issue. This work presents analysis of an socially compliant robot motion strategy that could be employed by social robots such as humanoids, service robots or intelligent wheelchairs, for approaching and joining humans groups in interaction, and then become an equitable part of the interaction. Following our previous work that formalized the motion strategy, a detailed synthesis is presented here with experiments that validate the proposed system in the real world."
2280282,22736,21102,Application of fuzzy decision making in mobile robot navigation in dynamic environments,2009,This paper presents a modified sensor-based online method for mobile robot navigation generating paths in dynamic environments. The intelligent part of the algorithm is a Fuzzy Decision Maker (FDM) which enables the robot to do both the guidance-based tracking algorithm and the obstacle avoidance simultaneously. The output of FDM is a weighted combination of velocity vectors generated by velocity obstacle algorithm and guidance based tracking algorithm. The results prove that the robot can track a moving target while maneuvering safely in dynamic environment and avoids stationary and moving obstacles.
1330693,22736,9704,Multiple sensors data integration using MFAM for mobile robot navigation,2007,"The mobile robot navigation with complex environment needs more input space to match the environmental data into robot outputs in order to perform realistic task. At the same time, the number of rules at the rule base needs to be optimized to reduce the computing time and to provide the possibilities for real time operation. In this paper, the optimization of fuzzy rules using a modified fuzzy associative memory (MFAM) is designed and implemented. MFAM provides good flexibility to use multiple input space and reduction of rule base for robot navigation. This paper presents the MFAM model to generate the rule base for robot navigation. The behavior rules obtained from MFAM model are tested using simulation and real world experiments, and the results are discussed in the paper and compared with the existing methods."

380607,22736,23735,Penetrating keratoplasty: a robotised cut of cornea,1999,"After penetrating keratoplasty (PK, corneal grafting), an astigmatism occurs due to the cut and to the suture which cause deformations of the cornea. We propose to introduce new technologies into this surgery in order to limit the postoperative astigmatism and so to increase visual recovery. First of all, we study a new tool to cut cornea, a surgical waterjet. This device permits corneas to be cut at low pressure (15 to 35 bars) and with a small diameter of water (0.08 mm to 0.20 mm). Attempts have been made on freshly enucleated pig eyes, epithelium removed. The waterjet could be a useful tool for PK if it doesn't induce too much hydration of the tissue. We are working to limit this phenomenon. Another aim of our work is decreasing the postoperative astigmatism due to the suture. For that, we are thinking of limiting or avoiding this technique by robotising the cut and finding optimal shapes of cut. Different shapes of cut are studied. This is done by simulating the intraocular pressure with a height of water applying a pressure on a polyacrilamide gel. The conception of a surgical robot which would include chosen technologies is in progress."
1768290,22736,65,Voluntary self-tapping induces self-localization shift,2014,"Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is known to provide a proprioceptive drift toward the direction where the rubber hand is tapped. On the other hand, Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs) induce an entire body shift from a third-person Point of View (PoV). These experiences are known to trigger external passive tactile cues. Telexistence allows an entire body shift from a first-person PoV, compared to RHI and OBE. However, the precise origin of the entire localization is not revealed when we actively provide the internal voluntary tactile cue. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the effects of tactile cues to determine self-localization during the action of self-tapping. Participants viewed and tapped their own body on the back, and evaluated where on their body they perceived the tapping. The experiments show that the localized position tends to shift forward when an individual is tapped by a third-person; in contrast, the localized position tends to shift backward when an individual is tapping his own back. The subjective report indicates that participants perceived themselves as leaving their own bodies, or that someone appeared in front of them suddenly. Thus, we consider that self-produced tactile cue induces telexistence experience."
2259603,22736,8960,Using the Future to Sort Out the Present: Rankprop and Multitask Learning for Medical Risk Evaluation,1996,"A patient visits the doctor; the doctor reviews the patient's history, asks questions, makes basic measurements (blood pressure, ...), and prescribes tests or treatment. The prescribed course of action is based on an assessment of patient risk--patients at higher risk are given more and faster attention. It is also sequential--it is too expensive to immediately order all tests which might later be of value. This paper presents two methods that together improve the accuracy of backprop nets on a pneumonia risk assessment problem by 10-50%. Rankprop improves on backpropagation with sum of squares error in ranking patients by risk. Multitask learning takes advantage of future lab tests available in the training set, but not available in practice when predictions must be made. Both methods are broadly applicable."
2937597,22736,65,Study of children's hugging for interactive robot design,2016,"We have developed a toy sized humanoid robot with soft air-filled modules on its links which sense contact and protect the robot and any interacting humans from damaging collisions. This robot, meant for robust physical interaction, is required to endure contact with children in the form of hugs and other playful interactions. It is therefore necessary to quantify the forces exerted during these interactions so that robots can be designed to both withstand these forces, as well as interact safely and intuitively in these situations. To quantify the range of forces exerted by children when performing both soft and strong hugs, we conducted a study in which 28 children (11 boys, 17 girls) between 4 and 10 years old hugged a pressure sensing doll while the pressure was recorded. We found a child's maximum expected hugging force (2.623 psi for our setup) during free play. The data gathered in this study will guide the further development of our physically interactive robot."
1217087,22736,65,Practical issues on robotic education and challenges towards Roboethics Education,2009,"The rapidly increase of personal robotic platforms and their applications in Japan represents a great challenge for universities to introduce undergraduate students the basic knowledge required to develop intelligent automated mechanisms, by introducing in simple and efficient ways the basic components of robots as well as their application for solving real-world problems. In Japan, the proliferation of amateur robot contests has been introduced to motivate their interest to get involved in the robotics field. This is not only the case for tournaments supported by local governments and private companies. Several universities along Japan have been implementing Project-Based Learning (PBL) within their curricula as introduction for Mechatronic. For this purpose, at Waseda University, we focused in developing an education tool designed to introduce at different educational levels the principle of developing mechatronic systems. In particular, the development of an inverted pendulum mobile robot Waseda Wheeled Vehicle No. 2 (WV-2R) has been proposed. In this paper, an overview of the research results is detailed. Even that in many universities around the world has been promoting the introduction of robotic technology, little discussion has been done to analyze from an ethical point of view. In this paper, some issues related to both Robot Education and Engineering Ethical Education are give based on experiences carried out in Japan. Then, some points regarding the integration of RoboEthics Education are pointed out for discussion."

For this purpose; in this paper, we are presenting our approach to introduce first year undergraduate students of the Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering the basics of robotics systems. In particular, the details of curricula of the Mechatronics Laboratory (1) and (2) are explained. In both lessons, the students receive lectures of the content of each proposed topic and then, a set of practical experiments are done. On the other hand, in order to foster the creativity of undergraduate students of engineering fields, we focused in developing an education tool designed to introduce at different educational levels the principle of developing mechatronic systems. In particular, the development of an inverted pendulum mobile robot Waseda Wheeled Vehicle No. 2R (WV-2R) has been proposed. Regarding the Mechatronics Laboratory, questionnaires were proposed to obtain information from the students about their impressions of the lessons. From the comments collected from the questionnaires, we observed the advantages of the proposed curricula to introduce them about robot technology. On the other hand, different kinds of experiments were proposed to confirm the possibility of implementing controllers as well as changing physical properties of the system to observe differences on the response of the system."
358296,22736,22113,Aesthetic guideline driven photography by robots,2011,"Robots depend on captured images for perceiving the environment. A robot can replace a human in capturing quality photographs for publishing. In this paper, we employ an iterative photo capture by robots (by repositioning itself) to capture good quality photographs. Our image quality assessment approach is based on few high level features of the image combined with some of the aesthetic guidelines of professional photography. Our system can also be used in web image search applications to rank images. We test our quality assessment approach on a large and diversified dataset and our system is able to achieve a classification accuracy of 79%. We assess the aesthetic error in the captured image and estimate the change required in orientation of the robot to retake an aesthetically better photograph. Our experiments are conducted on NAO robot with no stereo vision. The results demonstrate that our system can be used to capture professional photographs which are in accord with the human professional photography."
2969063,22736,9475,Shape-centric modeling of traveling wave rectilinear locomotion for snake-like robots,2016,"A traveling wave rectilinear gait for elongated, continuous bodies is modeled as planar deviations along a baseline average body and with respect to an average body frame. This framework enables intuitive and convenient formulation of the gait as a cyclically-varying backbone curve as well as contact patterns and other elements of the model which are integral in computing external forcing. A rolling friction model is introduced to describe interactions with the environment. The equations of motion of the dynamical system are derived in closed form along with the steady-state velocity for a straight-line average body. We demonstrate that control objectives such as turning can be conveniently achieved by introducing a constant radius of curvature into the average body, without any change to the gait formulation."
1426298,22736,65,Synthesis of an interactive haptic dancing partner,2010,"This paper studies dancing as a haptic interaction task with the aim of replacing one of the human dancing partners by an interactive robot. Starting from haptic recordings of human dancing couples, the interactive behavior of a male dancing partner is synthesized. For this purpose recorded dancing steps are approximated using multiple vector fields and faded into each other by simply switching between them. Adaptation to the female style of dancing is realized by implementing an adaptation law which changes the step size of the robot. Experimental results performed on a mobile haptic interface show the validity of the presented approach."
2489451,22736,9616,Improvement of feature matching in catadioptric images using gyroscope data,2008,"Most of vision-based algorithms for motion and localization estimation requires matching some interest points in a pair of images. After building feature correspondence, it is possible to estimate camera motion/localization using epipolar geometry. However feature matching is still a challenging problem because of time constraint or image variability for example. In several robotic applications, the camera rotation may be known thanks to a gyroscope or another orientation sensor. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to answer the following question: can the knowledge of rotation from a gyroscope be used to improve feature matching. To analyze this new approach of camera and gyroscope data fusion, we proceed in two steps. First, we rotationally align the images using rotation information of the gyroscope. And second, we compare the quality of feature matching in the original and rotationally aligned images. Experimental results on a real catadioptric sequence show that gyroscope data permits to sensibly improve the number of inliers according to epipolar geometry."
1116404,22736,8441,Admissible thrust control laws for quadrotor position tracking,2013,"In this paper a hierarchical position tracking controller for a quadrotor is presented, which consists of an inner attitude controller and an outer position controller. The tracking error dynamics form a nonautonomous cascade built up by a linear attitude error subsystem and a linear position error subsystem, coupled by a nonlinear interconnection term. The stability properties of the cascaded system essentially rely on the characteristics of the interconnection term, which strongly depends on the choice of the thrust. We characterize a class of admissible thrust control laws in terms of closed loop asymptotic stability and demonstrate the significant influence of different laws on the transient behavior of the system."

1896895,22736,10994,Graspable parts recognition in man-made 3d shapes,2012,"We address the problem of automatic recognition of graspable parts in man-made 3D shapes, which exhibit high intra-class variability that cannot be captured with geometric descriptors alone. We observe that, in the presence of significant geometric and topological variations, the context of a part within a 3D shape provides important cues about its functionality. We propose to model the context as structural relationships between shape parts and use them, in addition to part geometry, as cues for identifying automatically the graspable parts. We design a set of spatial relationships that can be extracted from general shapes. Then, we propose a new similarity measure that captures a part context and enables better recognition of graspable parts. We use this property to design a classifier that learns the semantics of a shape part. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that are purely geometric-based."
1768262,22736,9099,Music-information retrieval in environments containing acoustic noise,2014,"In the field of Music-Information Retrieval (Music-IR), algorithms are used to analyze musical signals and estimate high-level features such as tempi and beat locations. These features can then be used in tasks to enhance the experience of listening to music. Most conventional Music-IR algorithms are trained and evaluated on audio that is taken directly from professional recordings with little acoustic noise. However, humans often listen to music in noisy environments, such as dance clubs, crowded bars, and outdoor concert venues. Music-IR algorithms that could function accurately even in these environments would therefore be able to reliably process more of the audio that humans hear. In this paper, I propose methods to perform Music-IR tasks on music that has been contaminated by acoustic noise. These methods incorporate algorithms such as Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA) and Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS) in order to identify important elements of the noisy musical signal. As an example, a noise-robust beat tracker utilizing these techniques is described."
1183099,22736,65,Sharing of control between an interactive shopping robot and it's user in collaborative tasks,2010,"An important challenge in service robotics is to design user interfaces and interaction capabilities that can be used intuitively to enable the potential users to benefit from the robot's functionalities and to allow effective collaborative task execution. The Interactive Behavior Operated shopping Trolley (InBOT) addresses this issue at the example of supporting complex shopping tasks in large supermarkets. The actual control of the robot is shared or traded between the robot and it's dedicated user ranging from closely coupled haptic-based interaction via observation-based interaction up to loosely coupled command-based interaction. The four modes of operation of InBOT, i.e. the manual steering, following, guiding and autonomous mode, the transitions between them and the relevant modalities of interaction are introduced. Finally the paper is completed by describing the results of user studies."
1758192,22736,208,Hopping enhanced sensors for efficient sensor network connectivity and coverage,2010,"This work presents the organization and operation of a hopping sensor wireless network. It defines two decentralized algorithms for the discovery of isolated nodes, aggressive and smart discovery, to propagate base station connectivity. Both algorithms rely on the usage of hopping sensors on the boundary of a cluster, without prior topology information. We studied the efficiency of the algorithms in terms of network energy consumption and connectivity propagation. A cluster to cluster (C-to-C) packet forwarding scheme, which relies upon boundary hopping sensor gateway nodes, is defined and simulated, and proves to have remarkable low energy consumption. In-field measurements were performed to obtain real data to serve as input parameters for simulations. Simulation results indicate significant savings in network wide energy consumption (57% for aggressive discovery and 79% for smart discovery)."
2128689,22736,21102,View estimation learning based on value system,2009,"Estimation of a caregiver's view is one of the most important capabilities for a child to understand the behavior demonstrated by the caregiver, that is, to infer the intention of behavior and/or to learn the observed behavior efficiently. We hypothesize that the child develops this ability in the same way as behavior learning motivated by an intrinsic reward, that is, he/she updates the model of the estimated view of his/her own during the behavior imitated from the observation of the behavior demonstrated by the caregiver based on minimizing the estimation error of the reward during the behavior. From this view, this paper shows a method for acquiring such a capability based on a value system from which values can be obtained by reinforcement learning. The parameters of the view estimation are updated based on the temporal difference error (hereafter TD error: estimation error of the state value), analogous to the way such that the parameters of the state value of the behavior are updated based on the TD error. Experiments with simple humanoid robots show the validity of the method, and the developmental process parallel to young children's estimation of its own view during the imitation of the observed behavior demonstrated by the caregiver is discussed."
955283,22736,11166,Revealing Cluster Formation over Huge Volatile Robotic Data,2011,"In this paper, we propose a driven by the robotics field method for revealing global clusters over a fast, huge and volatile stream of robotic data. The stream comes from a mobile robot which autonomously navigates in an unknown environment perceiving it through its sensors. The sensor data arrives fast, is huge and evolves quickly over time as the robot explores the environment and observes new objects or new parts of already observed objects. To deal with the nature of data, we propose a grid -- based algorithm that updates the grid structure and adjusts the so far built clusters online. Our method is capable of detecting object formations over time based on the partial observations of the robot at each time point. Experiments on real data verify the usefulness and efficiency of our method."

2264785,22736,65,Expressing emotions using gait of humanoid robot,2015,"Reading other's emotions is the key of a successful human-human communication. If we imagine using robots in human environment, the ability of robots to express emotions will help human communicate with the artificial agents. In studies about robots' expressing emotions, conversations, facial expression and simple gestures are mainly used. However, another way to express emotions is necessary to enable the expression in various scenes. This study focused on emotions conveyed by gait and examined the effectiveness of expression of emotions of a humanoid robot during gait. In the experiment, we generated 5 kinds of robot's emotional gait and showed them to the participants. Then participants forecast robot's emotion. This experiment was performed in Japan and in France, to investigate some cultural differences. As a result, this study shows that it is possible to convey emotions by gait for a humanoid robot and also that there is a cultural difference in forecasting emotions."
1911739,22736,65,Homotopy-based controller for physical human-robot interaction,2009,"This paper presents a model that describes physical interactions during dyadic collaborative tasks. This model is based on a homotopy between two controllers and defines the behavior of each partner as the result of a time-varying balance between two roles: the leader role, which consists in acting according to a plan without considering the other partner's intentions; and the follower role, which conversely consists in acting only based on the intentions of the other partner. The continuous switch between these two attitudes is described by two variables whose time-profile can define a task signature. After a brief presentation of the model, two illustrative scenarios are detailed to give more insights on how the homotopy parameter can be used to describe different situations that can occur in collaborative tasks between two partners. We especially focus on how some recent results in the human-human interaction can be encompassed by our proposed model. Experiments are performed to assess the usability of the model as a control scheme to implement advanced collaborative behaviors on a robotic platform."
2308397,22736,9475,Mobile robot based odor source localization via particle filter,2009,"We consider odor-source localization using a mobile robot in a time-variant airflow-field environment. Novel plume tracing and odor-source declaration methods are presented. When odor plume clue is found, an odor-patch path is estimated by a dynamic-window approach, and the robot traces the plume along a route planned from the odor-patch path. In parallel, a particle filter is used to localize an odor source. The source is declared if the estimated locations converge in a relatively small area for a given period. In view of the common foundational odor concentration that already exists in the local or even whole searched area before the robot searches, differential concentration based on moving-average value is used to obtain an adaptively variable concentration threshold. Experiment results in an indoor time-variant airflow experiment show that the robot can effectively approach and declare the odor source."
2471285,22736,9475,Time-optimal paths for a Dubins airplane,2007,"We consider finding a time-optimal trajectory for an airplane from some starting point and orientation to some final point and orientation. Our model extends the Dubins car by L.E. Dubins (1957) to have altitude, which leads to  Dubins   airplane . We assume that the system has independent bounded control over the altitude velocity as well as the turning rate in the plane. Through the use of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we characterize the time-optimal trajectories for the system. They are composed of turns with minimum radius, straight line segments, and pieces of planar elastica. One motivation for determining these elementary pieces is for use as motion primitives in modern planning and control algorithms that consider obstacles."

We report on an extensive comparison and experimental analysis of existing algorithms. We focus on typical motions of smartphones when carried by pedestrians. We use a precise ground truth obtained from a motion capture system. We test state-of-the-art attitude estimation techniques with several smartphones, in the presence of magnetic perturbations typically found in buildings. We discuss the obtained results, analyze advantages and limits of current technologies for attitude estimation in this context. Furthermore, we propose a new technique for limiting the impact of magnetic perturbations with any attitude estimation algorithm used in this context. We show how our technique compares and improves over previous works."

Through experiments of tennis forehand swing coaching task for beginners, we observed and analyzed three kinds of motions; a learning target swing performed by human coaches, swings performed by learners, and dynamically modified swing motions by human coaches according to performances of learners. With results, we modeled relationship between differences among the three motions in a phase space and used symbolic expressions. Then we discussed how the model can be applied for realizing an efficient motion coaching system we have been proposed."
1965638,22736,65,Proactive behavior of an autonomous mobile robot for human-assisted learning,2013,"During the last decade, there has been a growing interest in making autonomous social robots able to interact with people. However, there are still many open issues regarding the social capabilities that robots should have in order to perform these interactions more naturally. In this paper we present the results of several experiments conducted at the Barcelona Robot Lab in the campus of the “Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya” in which we have analyzed different important aspects of the interaction between a mobile robot and nontrained human volunteers. First, we have proposed different robot behaviors to approach a person and create an engagement with him/her. In order to perform this task we have provided the robot with several perception and action capabilities, such as that of detecting people, planning an approach and verbally communicating its intention to initiate a conversation. Once the initial engagement has been created, we have developed further communication skills in order to let people assist the robot and improve its face recognition system. After this assisted and online learning stage, the robot becomes able to detect people under severe changing conditions, which, in turn enhances the number and the manner that subsequent human-robot interactions are performed."

Images are compressed for each column, and the average and standard deviation of the pixels in each column are used. Environmental and observational data, which are the compressed image data at the registration and observational stages, are matched, and the position of the robot is obtained. The entire environment can be represented continuously with a small amount of data. A simple and robust matching method based on a voting process is introduced. The methods are evaluated through several experiments with omnidirectional images."

A SME interview approach was used to analyze video data of operators interacting with sAUVs.

We propose a preliminary human factors model to depict these components and discuss how they interact."
2893834,22736,9078,Localization and pose estimation of textureless objects for autonomous exploration missions,2016,"In this paper we describe an approach for detection and pose estimation of colored objects with only few or no textural features. The approach consists of two separate stages. First, we perform vision-based object detection and hypothesis filtering. Then, we estimate and validate the object's pose in 3-D laser scans. For object detection we integrate image segmentation results from multiple viewpoints in a set-theoretical filter that provides a probabilistically sound estimate of the number of objects and their respective locations. For validation and pose estimation we search for the best pose by sampling from a geometric measurement model. The system has been validated during autonomous exploration missions in unstructured and space-like environments."
1884151,22736,65,Prediction of head-rotation movements using neck EMG signals for auditory tele-existence robot “TeleHead”,2009,"A number of works have been reported on robot control using EMG signals. Control of robots, wheelchairs, and rehabilitation aids using the arms, hands or legs by EMG signals has been quite popular and effective. However, few works have dealt with head-movement control using neck EMG signals. We have built a model that estimates continuous human head movement from neck EMG signals. Our proposed model, which considered not only static but also dynamic effects, effectively suppressed the over/undershoot, and predicted head-rotation movements well. This result indicates that the proposed model has the potential to reconstruct the observed data from neck EMG signals properly."
2052808,22736,9616,Using Extended EM to Segment Planar Structures in 3D,2006,"The proposed algorithm segments planar structures out of data gained from 3D laser range scanners, typically used in robotics. The approach first fits planar patches to the dataset, using a new, extended Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm solves the classical EM problems of insufficient initialization by iteratively determining the number and positions of patches in a split and merge framework. Determining the fitting quality of the gained patches, the approach then allows for segmentation of planar surfaces out of the 3D environment. The result is a set of 2D objects, which can be used as input for classical computer vision applications, in particular for object recognition. Our approach makes it possible to apply classical tools of 2D image processing to solve problems of 3D robot mapping, e.g. landmark recognition."
1137810,22736,11470,Fast object recognition and 6D pose estimation using viewpoint oriented color-shape histogram,2013,"In this paper, we present an object recognition and pose estimation framework consisting of a novel global object descriptor, so called Viewpoint oriented Color-Shape Histogram (VCSH), which combines object's color and shape information. During the phase of object modeling and feature extraction, the whole object's color point cloud model is built by registration from multi-view color point clouds. VCSH is trained using partial-view object color point clouds generated from different synthetic viewpoints. During the recognition phase, the object is identified and the closest viewpoint is extracted using the built feature database and object's features from real scene. The estimated closest viewpoint provides a good initialization for object pose estimation optimization using the iterative closest point strategy. Finally, objects in real scene are recognized and their accurate poses are retrieved. A set of experiments is realized where our proposed approach is proven to outperform other existing methods by guaranteeing highly accurate object recognition, fast and accurate pose estimation as well as exhibiting the capability of dealing with environmental illumination changes."
2168961,22736,65,Extraction of human — object relations in Intelligent Space,2008,"This paper describes an observation system of human-objects interactions to extract relations among humans and physical objects in intelligent space (iSpace). The purpose is to obtain information of physical objects which can not be described in advance, in other words, depends on usage history of individual users. It is important issue for the iSpace to recognize human activities and design services for humans. In this paper, a method for multiple objects localization in the intelligent space is presented. The localization is realized by using two types of information. One is acceleration data which is used to determine whether an object is being operated. Acceleration data is acquired by using sensor network system. The other is hand position information of a nearest user to one object. By combining the information, positions of objects are able to be estimated by corresponding positions of user hands. In this method, determination of objects initial position is a first problem. In order to solve it, we use correlation of acceleration data among user hands and objects. Initial position of each object is given based on userpsilas hand position which is scored high correlation."

The vehicle is described by its dynamic model, considering such effects as lateral slipping and aerodynamic drag. We propose a modular solution, where three different problems are identified and solved by specific modules. The execution of the three modules can be orchestrated in different ways in order to produce efficient solutions to a variety of trajectory planning problems (e.g., obstacle avoidance, or overtake). As a specific example, we show how to generate the optimal lap on a specified racing track. The numeric examples provided in the paper are good witnesses of the effectiveness of our strategy."
2960338,22736,65,Modeling the interaction force during a haptically-coupled cooperative manipulation,2016,"One of the most challenging aspects of cooperative manipulation is coordination process between haptically-coupled subjects. The interaction force is believed to play a significant role in this process. In this paper, we propose a model for the interaction force and validate our model through a human study. The human study includes both bimanual and dyadic modes in three different scenarios, specifically designed to study the effect of coordination process in performance of the cooperation. We consider five different performance metrics to measure several aspects of the cooperation. The statistical analysis of these performance indexes proves that, while our model can explain the human behavior in different scenarios and different modes, the alternative models fail to do so."

The input images are acquired by a non-central catadioptric sensor mounted on a robot moving on a straight line. We propose to use the IBR for column ordering only, where occlusions in the horizontal direction are modeled and the sensor can be non-central. For the column matching between a query view at an unknown position and virtual views created by IBR, we use correlation of columns."

A typical attitude stabilisation system consists of MEMs accelerometers, gyroscopes linked to separate attitude estimator and attitude controller algorithms. This paper proposes a non-linear attitude stabiliser for low-cost aerial robotic vehicles that combines attitude and bias estimation with control. The attitude control algorithm is based on a non-linear control Lyapunov function analysis derived directly in terms of the rigid-body attitude dynamics and measurement signals."
1588479,22736,65,A framework for representing interaction tasks based on tactile data,2010,"This paper describes a framework for representing physical interaction tasks using tactile feedback. Although contact feedback has been widely exploited to control interaction with objects, the direct use of tactile information in designing and representing physical interaction rules has not received comparable attention in the literature. The missing link between algorithms implementing models of interaction and frameworks providing tactile information is one of the possible reasons. The major contribution of the paper is a working method to build a map of tactile sensors attached to a robot body and a control law using such a map to tune physical interaction with an external object. Experiments are used to validate the approach."

This work is involved with the latter, and presents an analytical method for pose estimation using any central catadioptric system. Any known four points in the world, forming a planar rectangle. may be used for pose computation.

The proposed solution relies on an feature-based RGBD SLAM algorithm to localize the camera and update the 3D map of the scene. To improve the accuracy and the robustness of the localization, we propose to combine in a local bundle adjustment process, geometric information provided by a prior coarse 3D model of the scene (e.g. generated from the 2D plan of the building) with RGBD data. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public benchmark dataset as well as on a real scene acquired by a Kinect sensor."

A nonlinear sensor-based system is designed and its dynamics augmented so that the proposed formulation can be considered as linear time-varying for the purpose of observability analysis. This allows the establishment of observability results related to the original nonlinear system that naturally lead to the design of a Kalman filter with GAS error dynamics. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed resorting to a set of realistic simulations and to the results obtained from experimental tests."

1804700,22736,65,Bilateral Control with Time Domain Passivity Approach Under Time-varying Communication Delay,2007,"Recently, two-port time-domain passivity approach was modified for time-varying communication delay. The newly proposed approach could achieve stable teleoperation even under the serious time-varying delay and packet loss communication condition. However, after some operation hour, the accumulated energy difference between the input energy from one port and the output energy at the other port caused unstable behavior until the passivity controller is activated. Resetting scheme is introduced for solving this problem, and stable bilateral teleoperation can be guaranteed without worrying about the accumulated energy difference."
2253565,22736,9475,Contact based robot control through tactile maps,2010,"This paper deals with the problem of controlling a robot during a physical interaction through a representation of its tactile system. Although the force feedback has been widely used to control the interaction with objects (e.g., object grasping and manipulation), the use of tactile data in more complex interaction tasks did not receive a comparable attention. The lack of an available skin-like technology has limited the development of tactile based control strategies. The major contribution of this paper is to describe a control strategy controlling the interaction task of a robot arm, equipped with tactile sensors, in contact with an external object or human through the somatosensory map. Experiments are used to validate the approach."

We have proposed an image sensor, named HyperOmniVision, with a hyperboloidal mirror for vision based navigation of the mobile robot. This sensing system can acquire an omnidirectional view around the robot in real time. In the case of the man-made route, road boundaries between the ground plane and wall appears as a close-looped curve in the image. By making use of this optical characteristic the robot can avoid obstacles and move along the corridor by tracking the close-looped curve with an active contour model. Experiments that have been done in a real environment are described."
1325790,22736,23735,Image based rendering for a mobile robot using visual landmarks,2005,"Image based rendering (IBR) is one of standard approaches to view synthesis. IBR would be very important for human-robot interface system (HRI) such as a teleoperation system, since the synthesized views are helpful for a human user to understand the robot's operating environment. In this paper, we address the problem of IBR on images taken by a mobile robot. Main difficulty of our problem is that the viewpoint locations of input (real) images are not precisely known, due to estimation errors inherent in the positioning systems. To solve this problem, we will propose a novel IBR method, where the location uncertainty is reduced using a visual landmark, which is commonly used in mobile robotics. In addition, novel priors on real images are introduced to regularize the IBR problem. As a result, IBR can be performed successfully under the location uncertainty."
716083,22736,23735,Engineering Intelligent Materials for the Interrogation of Bio-robotic Architectures and Regulatory Networks,2006,"Cells serve as culminating examples of integrated sensors and actuators, or biological robots, inspired by nature. Their membranes and internal regulatory networks are composed of a plethora of molecular machines, such as membrane and signalling proteins that drive a highly intelligent series of coordinated events, from metabolism to motility. Biostructures such as cells and membrane proteins serve as compelling fabrication materials for next-generation applications in medicine, energy, as well as micro/nanorobotics that can harness the intrinsic mechanisms of biology for practical applications. The interfacing of biotic with abiotic systems is expected to take advantage of the inherent evolution-perfected architectures of biology by using them to functionalize nonliving elements towards the fabrication of intelligent materials. Our work offers a strategic approach of intelligent material fabrication by interfacing the collagen Type I cellular adhesion factor with robust biomimetic copolymer membrane films that can be UV-crosslinked for enhanced durability and possess abilities to achieve high Langmuir-Blodgett deposition surface pressures for increased surface area coverage of the composite films. These films in turn serve as candidate modalities to interact directly with cell membrane-bound mechano-sensors that can use topographical or chemical cues to induce higher-order behavior within the cell such as architectural rearrangement, etc. Here, we report the use of a biocompatible ABA triblock copolymer to serve as a molecular buoy on a Langmuir film air/water interface for thin film depositions of collagen, a large structural protein amongst its many other biological functions. Immunofluorescence studies have been used to confirm collagen transfer onto solid substrates while surface pressure analysis was used to assess the dynamic nature of collagen interaction with the ABA triblock copolymer. In addition, in vitro C2C12 mouse myoblast culture atop these composite materials has revealed substrate-mediated influences on cellular morphology and architecture. Using these hybrid collagen-copolymer films to functionalize a wide array of surfaces may offer useful strategies for engineering bio-inspired integrated devices based on inherent cellular/molecular function, as well as the interrogation of biorobotic/cellular behavior and regulatory networks governing their architectural patterning based upon cell-matrix interactions"
1063751,22736,23735,Cooperative Damage Inspection with Unmanned Surface Vehicle and Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle at Hurricane Wilma,2006,"On Oct 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall at Cape Romano, Florida. Two days later, the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR) deployed an iSENSYS helicopter and an unmanned surface vehicle to survey damage in parts of Marco Island, 11 miles from landfall. Assistance was provided by the National Science Foundation's industry/university cooperative research center on safety security rescue technologies. The AEOS-1 USV was prototype built for environmental science studies. It was modified to carry a Sound Metric Dual frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON). The DIDSON was able to show the state of underwater structures, schools of small fish swimming, and find the railings from the collapsed section of a pier. This work validates the concept of using USVs and UAVs together for disaster response, suggests missions, and priorities for autonomy. Besides damage inspection, USV-UAV teams can find safe lanes of sea travel and to detect hazardous materials spills. In addition to providing situation awareness, the UAV can serve as a wireless network relay. Inspection of damage to seawalls, docks, and bridges requires vision above the waterline as well as below poses a new type of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)."

2175996,22736,65,Investigation on people living with Paro at home,2009,"We conducted a questionnaire survey for owners of Paro, using the questionnaires sent with Paro when they purchased it. They answered the questionnaires voluntarily; therefore, the results may reflect the positive tendency of respondents who like Paro or like to play with Paro. In this study, the owners' attributes and interaction with Paro are analyzed for indications of robot design for human-robot interaction intended for home use. The results showed that about 70% of the respondents were female and over 60 years old, and most of them cannot keep pets because they worry about the pet's death and find pet care difficult. The pet type robots for the elderly may, therefore, need to be designed for easy care. The sense of touch and word recognition are also important functions for interactive pet type robot design, along with its facial expressions and physical reactions to express emotions. Furthermore, taking into account of improvements of the robot, the weight of Paro and the battery needs to be customized. It is expected that these results will help in designing pet type robots."
252941,22736,23735,Recognizing the visual focus of attention for human robot interaction,2012,"We address the recognition of people's visual focus of attention (VFOA), the discrete version of gaze that indicates who is looking at whom or what. As a good indicator of addressee-hood (who speaks to whom, and in particular is a person speaking to the robot) and of people's interest, VFOA is an important cue for supporting dialog modelling in Human-Robot interactions involving multiple persons. In absence of high definition images, we rely on people's head pose to recognize the VFOA. Rather than assuming a fixed mapping between head pose directions and gaze target directions, we investigate models that perform a dynamic (temporal) mapping implicitly accounting for varying body/shoulder orientations of a person over time, as well as unsupervised adaptation. Evaluated on a public dataset and on data recorded with the humanoid robot Nao, the method exhibit better adaptivity and versatility producing equal or better performance than a state-of-the-art approach, while the proposed unsupervised adaptation does not improve results."
813538,22736,9475,Persistent coverage control with variable coverage action in multi-robot environment,2013,"In this paper we tackle the problem of persistent coverage, where a team of agents covers an area whose amount of coverage degrades with time. The task is never accomplished completely due to the coverage decay and the agents have to revisit the domain persistently. In this framework, our contribution is a novel approach which consists not only in developing efficient motion to perform the coverage, but also in covering the domain with a variable coverage action. The agents can adapt its coverage power to the coverage error of the actuator domain, being able to reduce the energy consumption and the coverage error. We propose a new controller for the coverage power and we demonstrate by means of simulations that it is more efficient and flexible than developing the coverage with constant power."
2610852,22736,30,Massively-multicellular alignment with the self-aggregate of air bubbles.,2015,"This study proposes a cell manipulation method with aggregated air bubbles on cell culture medium. This method requires no additional regents nor devices, except for normal cell-culture materials such as cell culture dishes and pipettes. Bubbles generated by pipetting were spontaneously aggregated with regularity on the whole surface and used as a mask for avoiding cell adhesion after cell-seeding. The diameter of bubbles was able to be controlled by the size of micro-pipette tips. Seeded cells spread to the whole area along the bubble gap. This technique is a surface-tension-driven self-assembly-based method. Using this technique, millions of living cells were successfully aligned into a hexagonal pattern within 300 μm in pattern width on the whole surface of dish for less than 2 h."
1255216,22736,65,Enhancing My Keepon robot: A simple and low-cost solution for robot platform in Human-Robot Interaction studies,2014,"Many robots capable of performing social behaviors have recently been developed for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) studies. These social robots are applied in various domains such as education, entertainment, medicine, and collaboration. Besides the undisputed advantages, a major difficulty in HRI studies with social robots is that the robot platforms are typically expensive and/or not open-source. It burdens researchers to broaden experiments to a larger scale or apply study results in practice. This paper describes a method to modify My Keepon, a toy version of Keepon robot, to be a programmable platform for HRI studies, especially for robot-assisted therapies. With an Arduino microcontroller board and an open-source Microsoft Visual C# software, users are able to fully control the sounds and motions of My Keepon, and configure the robot to the needs of their research. Peripherals can be added for advanced studies (e.g., mouse, keyboard, buttons, PlayStation2 console, Emotiv neuroheadset, Kinect). Our psychological experiment results show that My Keepon modification is a useful and low-cost platform for several HRI studies."
2943565,22736,65,Data-driven haptic perception for robot-assisted dressing,2016,"Dressing is an important activity of daily living (ADL) with which many people require assistance due to impairments. Robots have the potential to provide dressing assistance, but physical interactions between clothing and the human body can be complex and difficult to visually observe. We provide evidence that data-driven haptic perception can be used to infer relationships between clothing and the human body during robot-assisted dressing. We conducted a carefully controlled experiment with 12 human participants during which a robot pulled a hospital gown along the length of each person's forearm 30 times. This representative task resulted in one of the following three outcomes: the hand missed the opening to the sleeve; the hand or forearm became caught on the sleeve; or the full forearm successfully entered the sleeve. We found that hidden Markov models (HMMs) using only forces measured at the robot's end effector classified these outcomes with high accuracy. The HMMs' performance generalized well to participants (98.61% accuracy) and velocities (98.61% accuracy) outside of the training data. They also performed well when we limited the force applied by the robot (95.8% accuracy with a 2N threshold), and could predict the outcome early in the process. Despite the lightweight hospital gown, HMMs that used forces in the direction of gravity substantially outperformed those that did not. The best performing HMMs used forces in the direction of motion and the direction of gravity."
2265302,22736,65,Survey of Psychophysiology Measurements Applied to Human-Robot Interaction,2007,"This paper reviews the literature related to the use of psychophysiology measures in human-robot interaction (HRI) studies in an effort to address the fundamental question of appropriate metrics and methodologies for evaluating HRI research, especially affect. It identifies four main methods of evaluation in HRI studies: (1) self-report measures, (2) behavioral measures, (3) psychophysiology measures, and (4) task performance. However, the paper also shows that using only one of these measures for evaluation is insufficient to provide a complete evaluation and interpretation of the interactions between a robot and the human with which it is interacting. In addition, the paper describes exemplar HRI studies which use psychophysiological measures; these implementations fall into three categories: detection and/or identification of specific emotions of participants from physiological signals, evaluation of participants' responses to a robot through physiological signals, and development and implementation of real-time control and modification of robot behaviors using physiological signals. Two open research questions on psychophysiological metrics were identified as a result of this review."
2920470,22736,65,Leveraging phantom signals for improved voice-based human-robot interaction,2016,"Voice-based system used in human-robot interaction is susceptible to challenging environment conditions. In an enclosed environment, the speech signal is often reflected which causes smearing as it is observed in the microphone. This phenomenon creates mismatch with the acoustic model, degrading the recognition performance and the robot's ability to understand and execute commands. Moreover, phantoms increase false-alarm in robot's attention system. To address these issues, environment-matched training and model adaptation may be used. The former requires enormous amount of training data to exhaustively cover different matched conditions whereas the latter needs several adaptation data to be collected at runtime. It is important to stress that data collection and the wait time are luxuries in a robot setup. In this paper, we extend our previous work that mitigates these problem by combining environment-adaptive training, speech enhancement with phantom awareness and fast model update, respectively. As a result, we achieve a robust voice-based system that enhances the observed speech, rejects phantoms and automatically updates the model at runtime to minimize the mismatch. Results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms our previous work."
2012870,22736,65,Micro pneumatic valves for wearable robotic systems,2015,"This paper describes small-sized pneumatic valves applicable to wearable robotic systems. Pneumatic actuators, especially McKibben actuators and balloon actuators, have been utilized in wearable robotic systems. Although these actuators are light in weight, their control valves are heavy and bulky, hindering the performance of wearable systems. Compact control valves to drive pneumatic actuators are therefore needed. Miniaturized unconstrained valves are novel pneumatic control valves, which, together with their driver circuits (PZT drivers), can drive pneumatic actuators. We have developed miniaturized valves and PZT drivers. A prototype valve 7mm in radius and 9mm in height was capable of controlling 0.5 MPa pressure with 3 l/min flow. Experiments performed to evaluate the developed system showed that these miniaturized unconstrained valves could drive a robotic finger and a manipulator."
1818745,22736,65,Robot task control utilizing human-in-the-loop perception,2008,"We propose a network robot application utilizing a human-in-the-loop structure. The proposed structure hybridizes robot perception with perception capability of a human, rendering a robot immune to the uncontrolled environment. Network infrastructure enables the user to intervene in the operation of a robot whenever necessary, enabling seamless transition of task control between the robot and the remote user. We have developed a prototype security robot system by implementing the proposed human-in-the-loop structure. Introduction of network infrastructure, however, also invokes system instability due to network fluctuation, time delay, or jittering. We could resolve the instability by imparting task intelligence to the robot and employing wireless distribution system (WDS) configuration for seamless data communication beyond the coverage of a single access point. Although our approach may solve only part of problems inherent in networked robots, we found that the developed robot system bears sufficient applicability to real world robotic systems incorporating large-area robot navigation."
1761832,22736,8441,Simultaneous attitude control and trajectory tracking of a micro quadrotor: A SNAC aided nonlinear dynamic inversion approach,2013,"This paper presents an advanced single network adaptive critic (SNAC) aided nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) approach for simultaneous attitude control and trajectory tracking of a micro-quadrotor. Control of micro-quadrotors is a challenging problem due to its small size, strong coupling in pitch-yaw-roll and aerodynamic effects that often need to be ignored in the control design process to avoid mathematical complexities. In the proposed SNAC aided NDI approach, the gains of the dynamic inversion design are selected in such a way that the resulting controller behaves closely to a pre-synthesized SNAC controller for the output regulation problem. However, since SNAC is based on optimal control theory, it makes the dynamic inversion controller to operate near optimal and enhances its robustness property as well. More important, it retains two major benefits of dynamic inversion: (i) closed form expression of the controller and (ii) easy scalability to command tracking application even without any apriori knowledge of the reference command. Effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated from six degree-of-freedom simulation studies of a micro-quadrotor. It has also been observed that the proposed SNAC aided NDI approach is more robust to modeling inaccuracies, as compared to the NDI controller designed independently from time domain specifications."
1428795,22736,8228,The impact of cooperative localization on achieving higher-level goals,2013,"Cooperative localization is a promising way to improve localization accuracy and coverage in GPS-challenged conditions. Accuracy and coverage improvements have a direct, though not necessarily proportional, impact on higher-level goals that rely on location information. We evaluate this impact in terms of achieving a non-cooperative navigation task, by extending the conventional state-space model with a control signal and continuous-time processing. For a heterogeneous scenario involving two nodes, we show how cooperation can enable task completion, and reduce the time to completion."
2242325,22736,65,Proof of concept for a user-centered system for sharing cooperative plan knowledge over extended periods and crew changes in space-flight operations,2015,"With the Robonaut-2 humanoid robot now permanently flying on the ISS, the potential role for robots participating in cooperative activity in space is becoming a reality. Recent research has demonstrated that cooperation in the joint achievement of shared goals is a promising framework for human interaction with robots, with application in space. Perhaps more importantly, with the turn-over of crew members, robots could play an important role in maintaining and transferring expertise between outgoing and incoming crews. In this context, the current research builds on our experience in systems for cooperative human-robot interaction, introducing novel interface and interaction modalities that exploit the long‐term experience of the robot. We implement a system where the human agent can teach the Nao humanoid new actions by physical demonstration, visual imitation, and spoken command. These actions can then be composed into joint action plans that coordinate the cooperation between agent and human. We also implement algorithms for an Autobiographical Memory (ABM) that provides access to of all of the robots interaction experience. These functions are assembled in a novel interaction paradigm for the capture, maintenance and transfer of knowledge in a five-tiered structure. The five tiers allow the robot to 1) learn simple behaviors, 2) learn shared plans composed from the learned behaviors, 3) execute the learned shared plans efficiently, 4) teach shared plans to new humans, and 5) answer questions from the human to better understand the origin of the shared plan. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this system and indicate that such humanoid robot systems will provide a potential mechanism for the accumulation and transfer of knowledge, between humans who are not co-present. Applications to space flight operations as a target scenario are discussed."
705580,22736,8806,Force model of a robotic particle chain for 3d displays,2015,We aim to construct a 3D screen -- an initially at 2D surface that can fold into the third dimension to display arbitrary three dimensional surface shapes. Our approach is based on chains of robotic particles that can be individually actuated to fold into a desired curve. This paper contributes a computational model of the forces acting on the robotic particles. Experimental results show that the model accurately predicts reality. The model forms the core of force-minimizing planning algorithms that compute a folding sequence approximating a given target curve while minimizing the actuation forces. The model is also instrumental for simulation tools that allow to study forces while executing a given folding sequence.
987391,22736,8806,On the similarities between control based and behavior based visual servoing,2015,"Robotics is tightly connected to both artificial intelligence (AI) and control theory. Both AI and control based robotics are active and successful research areas, but research is often conducted by well separated communities. In this paper, we compare the two approaches in a case study for the design of a robot that should move its arm towards an object with the help of camera data. The control based approach is a model-free version of Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS), which is based on mathematical modeling of the sensing and motion task. The AI approach, here denoted Behavior-Based Visual Servoing (BBVS), contains elements that are biologically plausible and inspired by schema-theory. We show how the two approaches lead to very similar solutions, even identical given a few simplifying assumptions. This similarity is shown both analytically and numerically. However, in a simple picking task with a 3 DoF robot arm, BBVS shows significantly higher performance than the IBVS approach, partly because it contains more manually tuned parameters. While the results obviously do not apply to all tasks and solutions, it illustrates both strengths and weaknesses with both approaches, and how they are tightly connected and share many similarities despite very different starting points and methodologies."

The finger design is done using a path-point generation method based on geometrical dimensions and motion of a typical index human finger. Following the design description, and its kinematics analysis, the experimental evaluation of the finger gripping performance is presented using the finger 3D printed prototype. The finger underactuation is achieved by utilizing mechanical linkage system, consisting of two crossed four-bar linkage mechanisms. It is shown that the proposed finger design can be used to design a five-fingered anthropomorphic hand and has the potential for upper limb prostheses development."

The proposed haptic device is based on a modified 6-RSS parallel mechanism. Small inertia of the device is obtained by locating all the actuators on the fixed platform. The inverse and forward kinematics of the device is solved by a new numerical method. Singular configurations are identified and prevented from being within the required task workspace. The required force and torque is achieved within the task workspace. The performance of the device has been proved satisfying the design requirements."
1886023,22736,65,Task skill transfer of circle handle valve manipulation,2005,"This paper describes how to write a task skill program of circle handle valve manipulation. It is difficult to program a complicated motion with a knack. Thus, in a previous paper, we proposed a task skill transfer method using a bilateral teleoperation to be able to program the knack easily. The task skill is composed of an initial condition, a task skill motion and a final condition. The initial and final conditions are described by the force and the position of the end-effector. The task skill motion is implemented by the hybrid impedance/force control. This hybrid impedance/force control is effective to a positional error. In this paper, we show that it is able to program the complicated motion with the knack (the hole search motion) easily."

The final goal of the development is realization of a lightweight and compact joint. Two actuators and two nonlinear springs constitute an antagonistic actuation system, and assist of a human elbow is realized by changing stiffness and equilibrium around the joint.

1710970,22736,9475,Improving tracking accuracy of a MIMO state feedback controller for elastic joint robots,2014,"In this paper a control scheme is addressed to improve the tracking accuracy of flexible joint robots without replacing the structure of a MIMO state feedback controller which is used effectually with the DLR medical robots. By using the desired position, the new desired link torque, as well as their derivatives the effects of nonlinear dynamics are compensated and the tracking accuracy is thereby increased. Hereby, the new desired link torque takes the whole rigid body dynamics into account, not only the friction and gravitation compensation terms. A stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's lemma is given for this new MIMO state feedback control scheme. Experimental results validate the practical efficiency of the approach."

The emotion of robots has become an issue of interest in the field of robotics. This robot head, EEEX(exaggerating emotion expresser) is developed to efficiently express various emotions. EEEX is useful in the human-robot interaction. EEEX has 3 special elements that humans do not possess to clearly express emotions. The first is arm-type antennae which consist of a 3-DOFs link system on each side to make dynamically emotional movements. They are specialized parts to show emotion by copying the humanpsilas arm motion. Second, emoticon-eyes help to represent emotions intuitively since the eyes are the most important parts to convey emotions. Lastly, exaggerating jaw & cheeks when expressing exaggerative emotions should assist in emotional expression as well, particularly surprise and anger. These 3 parts, the arm-type antennae, emoticon-eyes and exaggerating jaw & cheeks, would help human to recognize a robotpsilas emotions more clearly."
1907911,22736,9579,Human-robot interaction: a survey,2007,"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has recently received considerable attention in the academic community, in labs, in technology companies, and through the media. Because of this attention, it is desirable to present a survey of HRI to serve as a tutorial to people outside the field and to promote discussion of a unified vision of HRI within the field. The goal of this review is to present a unified treatment of HRI-related problems, to identify key themes, and discuss challenge problems that are likely to shape the field in the near future. Although the review follows a survey structure, the goal of presenting a coherent story of HRI means that there are necessarily some well-written, intriguing, and influential papers that are not referenced. Instead of trying to survey every paper, we describe the HRI story from multiple perspectives with an eye toward identifying themes that cross applications. The survey attempts to include papers that represent a fair cross section of the universities, government efforts, industry labs, and countries that contribute to HRI, and a cross section of the disciplines that contribute to the field, such as human, factors, robotics, cognitive psychology, and design."
1087409,22736,65,Evaluating in real life robotic environment: Bringing together research and practice,2012,"In this paper we report about a methodological approach to cooperatively evaluate the usability of two different teach pendants for teaching a robotic arm. Two case studies were conducted to compare an already established teach pendant with a novel prototype which applies a different interaction paradigm. Involved in these studies were the company which produces the teach pendant (our industrial partner) and two clients of this company (one in the automotive sector, the other one in the injection modeling sector). We describe the cooperation in this project in detail, how the industrial partners were involved, and our approach to enhance the integration of usability studies in the life cycle of their industrial robotic products. Upon conducting these case studies in the industrial context we come to understand bit by bit the interplay of industrial robots in a better way and how we could affect user centered design (UCD) of real life robotic products with our work."
2892009,22736,9078,A decoupled virtual camera using spherical optical flow,2016,"In camera-equipped teleoperated robots, it is often tedious for the operator to manage both the viewpoint and the shaky/unstable navigation, leading to disorientation. Our proposal is to create a virtual, freely rotatable camera that is decoupled from the robot's rotation. It is implemented using a complete spherical camera and removing its rotation in-image with a novel algorithm based on aligning the dense spherical optical flow field along the epipolar direction. Finally, any area on the rotation-less image sequence can be undistorted, resulting in the desired decoupled camera. We illustrate the concept by showing the effect on some videos taken from a spherical camera under different robot motions."
1550878,22736,8806,Distributed and efficient algorithm for self-reconfiguration of MEMS microrobots,2013,"Self-reconfiguration for moving MEMS microrobots currently needs a positioning system and a map of the target shape. Traditional positioning solutions like GPS or multilateration are not applicable in the micro-world and maps sharing does not scale. In this paper we present self-reconfiguration method where nodes are unaware of their positions, and where they do not have the final coordinates of each microrobots. In other words, nodes do not store the correct positions that build the target shape. Consequently memory usage for each node is reduced to  O (1). This algorithm does not need message exchange to achieve the self-reconfiguration from a chain to square configuration (microrobots are organized in square shape) that represents the optimal logical topology for messages sending and it ensures a  Snap-connectivity . Obtained results show a rapid convergence of the algorithm. The worst-case time complexity is of  n  movement rounds, where  n  represents the number of microrobots. Our algorithm is implemented in the declarative language MELD and executed in the simulator DPRSim."
1972588,22736,65,A different approach of using Personas in human-robot interaction: Integrating Personas as computational models to modify robot companions' behaviour,2013,"The current paper focuses on a novel integration of the Personas technique into HRI studies, and the definition of a Persona-Based Computational Behaviour Model for achieving socially intelligent robot companions in living environments. Our core interest is the creation of companions adapted to users' needs to support their activities of daily living. The aim is to create a mechanism that allows us to develop initial robot behaviour, i.e. behaviour when first encountering the user, which is already adapted to each user without the necessity of collecting in advance a large dataset to train the system. A persona represents the specific needs of many individuals for a particular scenario. This technique helps us develop initial robot behaviour adapted to user needs, and so reduces the amount of trials that participants have to perform during early stages of the system development. The paper describes how this behaviour model has been created and integrated into a functional architecture, and presents the motivation, background and conceptual framework for this new research direction. Future empirical studies will validate this approach and expand the initial definition of our model."

The therapeutic seal robot, PARO, is used in various facilities for the elderly, and its use spreading throughout the world. In previous studies, the effects of PARO were examined by various types of tests. However, the number of subjects in those studies was low. In this study, PARO was introduced in 10 facilities for the elderly, and 83 elderly individuals interacted with it under “the Nursing-care Robot Promotion Project” sponsored by Kanagawa prefecture, Japan.

However, what has not been evaluated yet is the user acceptance of such forms of interaction. In this paper we discuss two separate but similar studies which were aimed at assessing the usability of constrained and artificial languages in contrast to natural languages. The interaction context was implemented in a game played between children and the iCat robot. We subjectively measured various variables related to gaming experience and interacting in the new languages. Our results reveal that there were no significant differences in the user experience across the two interaction mediums in comparison to natural languages."

1726613,22736,65,The Sixth-Finger: A modular extra-finger to enhance human hand capabilities,2014,"Robotic prosthesis are usually intended as artificial device extensions replacing a missing part of a human body. A new approach regarding robotic limbs is presented here. A modular robot is used not only for replacing a missing part of the body but also as an extra-limb in order to enhance manipulation dexterity and enlarge the workspace of human beings. In this work, the model and control of an additional finger, the Sixth-Finger, is presented as a case study of this type of robotic limbs. The robotic finger has been placed on the wrist opposite to the hand palm. This solution allows to enlarge the hand workspace, increasing the grasp capability of the user. An object-based mapping algorithm is proposed to control the robotic extra-finger by interpreting the whole hand motion in grasping action. A four DoFs modular prototype is presented along with numerical simulations and real experiments. The proposed Sixth-Finger can lead to a wide range of applications in the direction of augmenting human capabilities through wearable robotics."

To make a natural communication entrainment between human and robot emotions plays a vital role. From this view point we propose to make a KANSEI communication system based on emotional synchronization. We developed a robotic KANSEI communication system using entrainment of dynamics, and its effectiveness was examined by experiments of human-robot communication. The robotic emotion was entrained to human emotion by using a vector field of dynamics. The robotic facial expression using a communication robot ldquoKamin_FA1rdquo was realized dynamically based on the robotic emotion. In the experiment of communication, the human impression was changed by the strength of synchronization of robot. Then we confirmed that this method could utilize human-robot communication to keep a comfortable state."
771347,22736,65,Indoor localization and point cloud generation for building interior modeling,2013,"Indoor modeling can be defined as the study of how photorealistic 3D model can be realized by localization and mapping for describing indoor environment which is beyond 2D model while providing useful information on the location. In this paper, a 3D localization method for an IGS(Information Gathering System) is presented for the point cloud generation of building interiors. First, a backpack IGS which is worn by a human operator and gathers information on environment along hallways is introduced. Next, a travel distance of the IGS is defined, which is utilized for estimating 3D poses of IGS. Then a 3D pose estimation method for localization of the IGS is proposed based on the SLAM method composed of two kinds of 2D SLAM methods, which extract the most reliable poses from the sensors on IGS. The proposed method is evaluated on challenging data of various indoor environments, and it is shown that it effectively localizes the IGS in complex indoor spaces with staircases."
727139,22736,65,Modeling of everyday objects for semantic grasp,2014,This paper presents a knowledge model of everyday objects for semantic grasp. This model is intended for extracting the grasp areas of everyday objects and approach directions for grasping when the 3D point cloud data and the intended purpose are given. Parts that make up everyday objects have functions related to their manipulation. We therefore represent everyday objects in terms of connected parts of functional units. This knowledge model describes the structure of everyday objects and information on their manipulation. The structure of an everyday object describes component parts of the object in terms of simple shape primitives to provide geometrical information and describes connections between parts with kinematic attributes. The information on the structure is used to map the manipulation knowledge onto the 3D point cloud data. The manipulation knowledge of the object includes the grasp areas and approach directions for the intended purpose. Fine grasps suitable for the intended task can be generated by performing a grasp planning with consideration for stable grasp and the kinematics of the robot in the grasp areas and approach directions.
2927945,22736,65,Automated incline detection for assistive powered wheelchairs,2016,"This work presents an algorithm for automated real-time ramp detection using 3D point cloud data in the context of shared-control powered wheelchairs. Limitations in the interfaces available to those with severe motor impairments can make basic maneuvering tasks with powered wheelchairs difficult. Although a significant amount of work has been done on obstacle detection and avoidance, much less attention has been given to algorithms for the safe and reliable detection of ramps and inclines; even though navigating these structures is an important part of urban life. We provide an algorithmic solution for accurately detecting traversable inclines for applications with powered wheelchairs using the Point Cloud Library (PCL) within the Robotics Operating System (ROS) framework. All algorithms are implemented first in simulation and later evaluated on data obtained from indoor and outdoor urban environments. We measure the performance of our algorithm with systematic testing on several different ramp structures, observed from varied viewpoints. Results show that our algorithm is successful in detecting the orientation, slope, and width of traversable ramps with up to 100% accuracy and an average detection accuracy of 88%."
2631895,22736,9475,Avoiding multiple collisions through trajectory replanning using piecewise Bézier curves,2015,"This paper presents a collision prediction and avoidance algorithm based on piecewise Bezier curves. Upon detection of an obstacle, the algorithm checks for a possible collision and modifies the vehicle's planned trajectory, if needed. Under mild assumptions, the replanned trajectory is guaranteed to avoid the collision and satisfy mission-specific constraints. The bounds on changes in position, velocity and acceleration caused by trajectory replanning are computable a priori. These bounds can be used during the mission-planning phase to guarantee satisfaction of vehicle dynamic constraints by the replanned trajectory. The algorithm presented here can be used to avoid multiple collisions under weaker assumptions as compared to previous results."

The use of a therapeutic seal robot, Paro, in various facilities for the elderly is spreading around the world. However, caregivers use Paro freely, and the ways in which they use Paro differ among them. Therefore, the effects are influenced by their skills. A manual that shows effective ways to use Paro is needed.

1211306,22736,65,A maneuverable robotic wheelchair able to move adaptively with a caregiver by considering the situation,2013,"Although it is desirable for wheelchair users to move alone by operating wheelchairs themselves, they are often pushed or accompanied by caregivers, especially in elderly care facilities. In designing robotic wheelchairs, therefore, it is important to consider how to reduce the caregiver's load and support their activities. We particularly focus on communication among wheelchair users and caregivers because face-to-face communication is known to be effective in ameliorating elderly mental health issues. Hence, we propose a maneuverable robotic wheelchair that can move autonomously towards a goal while considering the situation of the accompanying caregiver. Our robotic wheelchair starts to move autonomously towards the goal as soon as the caregiver sets the goal position, such as a bathroom, by utilizing its touch panel interface. While moving towards the goal, the robotic wheelchair autonomously controls its speed and direction of movement to facilitate natural communication between the wheelchair user and the caregiver, by observing the situation of the accompanying caregiver."
2031359,22736,65,A friendly gesture: Investigating the effect of multimodal robot behavior in human-robot interaction,2011,"Gesture is an important feature of social interaction, frequently used by human speakers to illustrate what speech alone cannot provide, e.g. to convey referential, spatial or iconic information. Accordingly, humanoid robots that are intended to engage in natural human-robot interaction should produce speech-accompanying gestures for comprehensible and believable behavior. But how does a robot's non-verbal behavior influence human evaluation of communication quality and the robot itself? To address this research question we conducted two experimental studies. Using the Honda humanoid robot we investigated how humans perceive various gestural patterns performed by the robot as they interact in a situational context. Our findings suggest that the robot is evaluated more positively when non-verbal behaviors such as hand and arm gestures are displayed along with speech. These findings were found to be enhanced when the participants were explicitly requested to direct their attention towards the robot during the interaction."
2677821,22736,9579,Initiative in Robot Assistance during Collaborative Task Execution,2016,"Collaborative robots are quickly gaining momentum in real-world settings. This has motivated many new research questions in human-robot collaboration. In this paper, we address the questions of whether and when a robot should take initiative during joint human-robot task execution. We develop a system capable of autonomously tracking and performing table-top object manipulation tasks with humans and we implement three different initiative models to trigger robot actions. Human initiated help gives control of robot action timing to the user; robot-initiated reactive help triggers robot assistance when it detects that the user needs help; and robot-initiated proactive help makes the robot help whenever it can. We performed a user study (N=18) to compare these trigger mechanisms in terms of task performance, usage characteristics, and subjective preference. We found that people collaborate best with a proactive robot, yielding better team fluency and high subjective ratings. However, they prefer having control of when the robot should help, rather than working with a reactive robot that only helps when it is needed."
2506935,22736,65,Effects of emotional synchronization in human-robot KANSEI communications,2009,"Human-robot communication is an important subject for housekeeping, elderly care and entertainment robots. To make a natural communication entrainment between human and robot, emotion plays a vital role. From this view point we have developed a KANSEI communication system based on emotional synchronization [1]. The robotic emotion was entrained to human emotion by using a vector field of dynamics, and then the robot made a facial expression to express the robot emotion. In this paper we investigate the effect of the emotional synchronization in human-robot KANSEI communications. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effects of the proposed system based on emotional synchronization. In the experiments of human-robot interaction using the emotional synchronization, we found that human feeling became comfortable when the robot made the synchronized facial expression to human emotion. Then it was confirmed that emotional synchronization in human-robot interaction could be effective to keep a comfortable state."
2970540,22736,65,Grasp taxonomy based on force distribution,2016,"Human grasp has been studied extensively and many taxonomies have been developed to classify different grasp types. In this work, we collect a comprehensive list of grasp types and investigate the force distribution patterns among them. We conduct a human study and collect force data in various grasp types. Data collection is performed by utilizing a data glove that has seventeen force sensors. We analyze the measured forces and identify different patterns in force distribution. Employing voting technique over various clustering methods, we propose a robust clustering for the force patterns, namely the grasp taxonomy in force domain. The proposed grasp taxonomy can be exploited in designing robotic prosthetic hands, designing grasp controllers and action recognition in human-robot interaction."
2360010,22736,65,Human- and Situation-Aware People Following,2007,"The paper presents an approach to intelligent, interactive people following for autonomous robots. The approach combines robust methods for simultaneous localization and mapping and for people tracking in order to yield a socially and environmentally sensitive people following behavior. Unlike current purely reactive approaches (nearest point following) it enables the robot to follow a human in a socially acceptable way, providing verbal and non-verbal feedback to the user where necessary. At the same time, the robot makes use of information about the spatial and functional organization of its environment, so that it can anticipate likely actions performed by a human, and adjust its motion accordingly. As a result, the robot's behaviors become less reactive and more intuitive when following people around an indoor environment. The approach has been fully implemented and tested."
1333753,22736,65,Flexible Joint Actuator for Patient's Rehabilitation Device,2007,"Rehabilitation devices require a very precise actuating system. In this paper, a flexible joint actuator is proposed as an actuating system of an intelligent active orthosis. To generate joint torque as desired, a spring is installed between a motor and human joint and the motor is controlled to have a proper spring deflection for torque control. When the desired torque is zero, the motor should follow human joint motion which requires that the friction and inertia of the motor are compensated. The human joint and body part represent the load to the flexible joint actuator. They interact with environment and their parameters are not fixed. The controller for the flexible joint actuator must operate under these conditions."

1103567,22736,23735,"Teaching RoboClam to Dig: The design, testing, and genetic algorithm optimization of a biomimetic robot",2010,"Razor clams (Ensis directus) are one of nature's most adept burrowing organisms, able to dig to 70cm at nearly 1cm/s using only 0.21J/cm. We discovered that Ensis reduces burrowing drag by using motions of its shell to fluidize a thin layer of substrate around its body. We have developed RoboClam, a robot that digs using the same mechanisms as Ensis, to explore how localized fluidization burrowing can be extended to engineering applications. In this work we present burrowing performance results of RoboClam in Ensis' habitat. Using a genetic algorithm to optimize RoboClam's kinematics, the machine was able to burrow at speeds comparable to Ensis, with a power law relationship between digging energy and depth of n = 1.17, close to the n = 1 achieved by the animal. Pushing through static soil has a theoretical energy-depth power law of n = 2, which means that Ensis-inspired digging motions can provide exponential energetic savings over existing burrowing methods."

1831864,22736,23735,A Virtual Nursing Simulator with Haptic Feedback for Nasotracheal Suctioning,2006,"Presently, there are a myriad of virtual reality applications being devised for the full spectrum of disciplines. Of particular interest are military and healthcare applications. The importance of simulators for training becomes clear for critical tasks such as flight or surgery. Moreover, there is merit to be found in simulators that educate nurses for critical procedures, especially for procedures that have the potential to cause serious pain and injury. The application presented in this paper is nasotracheal suctioning. This application trains and evaluates in an intuitive way, using force feedback, an elaborate visual interface, and a variety of auditory cues (sounds and verbal instructions). It allows the practitioner to perform this procedure repeatedly in a safe environment before conducting it on a live patient."
832122,22736,65,Playing catch with robots: Incorporating social gestures into physical interactions,2014,"For compelling human-robot interaction, social gestures are widely believed to be important. This paper investigates the effects of adding gestures to a physical game between a human and a humanoid robot. Human participants repeatedly threw a ball to the robot, which attempted to catch it. If the catch was successful, the robot threw the ball back to the human. For half of the cases in which the catch was unsuccessful, the robot made a physical gesture, such as shrugging its shoulders, shaking its head, or throwing up its hands. In the other half of cases, no gestures were produced. We used questionnaires and smile detection to compare participants' feelings about the robot when it made gestures after failure versus when it did not. Participants smiled more and rated the robot as more engaging, responsive, and humanlike when it gestured. We conclude that social gesturing of a robot enhances physical interactions between humans and robots."

1320171,22736,23735,Trans-radial prosthesis with three opposed fingers,2013,"There are body-powered hooks and myoelectric prosthetic hands that trans-radial amputees can use for work. Though the body-powered hooks have good workability for complex operations, the design of the hook is unappealing and the harness is cumbersome. The myoelectric prosthetic hand has a natural appearance similar to the human hand and intuitive operability using a myoelectric control system. However, it is expensive and heavy. Because of these problems associated with prostheses for work, many amputees use cosmetic prostheses. In this paper, we report a lightweight, low-cost electric trans-radial prosthesis with three opposed fingers. A simple mechanism to control the fingers by a linear actuator contributes to its good workability, lightweight, and low-cost. An operation system using an inexpensive distance sensor allows intuitive operability equivalent to the myoelectric control system. A socket makes the prosthesis easily removable. The total weight of the hand and socket is 300 g, and both can be produced with a 3D printer. An evaluation using the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) demonstrated that an amputee was able to operate abstract objects which require six types of grasps with the developed prosthesis."
2116073,22736,9475,"Control of an pseudo-omnidirectional, non-holonomic, mobile robot based on an ICM representation in spherical coordinates",2008,"For mobile platforms with steerable standard wheels it is necessary to precisely coordinate rotation and steering angle of their wheels. Especially for redundantly actuated platforms the misalignments of a single wheel directly leads to invalid configurations which may cause degraded motion of the platform and high internal forces. An established approach to deal with this problem is to represent the current state of motion in form of the instantaneous centre of motion (ICM) and to derive a valid trajectory for this point. However, this representation bears severe numerical drawbacks. To remedy those numerical problems an alternative ICM representation based on spherical coordinates is proposed in this work. Furthermore, the relations between ICM and generalized robot velocities are addressed. It is shown, that one receives a basis of a subspace within the kinematical constraints? nullspace by decomposing the generalized velocity vector in spherical coordinates. Finally the proposed ICM-based control is particularized and simulative analyzed w.r.t. the Care-O-bot 3 demonstrator."

Instructions were given to participants by the robot using either a high quality male, a high quality female, a neutral synthesized voice, or by the experimenter (no robot voice). Approaches to the robot with synthesized voice were found to induce significantly further approach distances. Those who had experienced a previous encounter with the robot tended to approach closer to the robot. Possible reasons for this are discussed."
1034911,22736,65,Extended duration human-robot interaction: Tools and analysis,2010,"Extended human-robot interactions possess unique aspects which are not exhibited in short-term interactions spanning a few minutes or extremely long-term spanning days. In order to comprehensively monitor such interactions, we need special recording mechanisms which ensure the interaction is captured at multiple spatio-temporal scales, viewpoints and modalities(audio, video, physio). To minimize cognitive burden, we need tools which can automate the process of annotating and analyzing the resulting data. In addition, we also require these tools to be able to provide a unified, multi-scale view of the data and help discover patterns in the interaction process. In this paper, we describe recording and analysis tools which are helping us analyze extended human-robot interactions with children as subjects. We also provide some experimental results which highlight the utility of such tools."
1791384,22736,8806,The BRICS component model: a model-based development paradigm for complex robotics software systems,2013,"Because robotic systems get more complex all the time, developers around the world have, during the last decade, created component-based software frameworks (Orocos, Open-RTM, ROS, OPRoS, SmartSoft) to support the development and reuse of large grained pieces of robotics software. This paper introduces the BRICS Component Model (BCM) to provide robotics developers with a set of guidelines, metamodels and tools for structuring as much as possible the development of, both, individual components and component-based architectures, using one or more of the aforementioned software frameworks at the same time, without introducing any framework- or application-specific details. The BCM is built upon two complementary paradigms: the 5Cs (separation of concerns between the development aspects of Computation, Communication, Coordination, Configuration and Composition) and the meta-modeling approach from Model-Driven Engineering."
1752103,22736,65,"‘Hey robot, please step back!’ - exploration of a spatial threshold of comfort for human-mechanoid spatial interaction in a hallway scenario",2014,"Within the scope of the current research the goal was to develop an autonomous transport assistant for hospitals. As a sort of social robots, they need to fulfill two main requirements with respect to their interactive behavior with humans: (1) a high level of safety and (2) a behavior that is perceived as socially proper. One important element includes the characteristics of movement. However, state-of-the-art hospital robots rather focus on safe but not smart maneuvering. Vital motion parameters in human everyday environment are personal space and velocity. The relevance of these parameters has also been reported in existing human-robot interaction research. However, to date, no minimal accepted frontal and lateral distances for human-mechanoid proxemics have been explored. The present work attempts to gain insights into a potential threshold of comfort and additionally, aims to explore a potential interaction of this threshold and the mechanoid's velocity. Therefore, a user study putting the users in control of the mechanoid was conducted in a laboratory hallway-like setting. Findings align with previously reported personal space zones in human-robot interaction research. Minimal accepted frontal and lateral distances were obtained. Furthermore, insights into a potential categorization of the lateral personal space area around a human are discussed for human-robot interaction."

871740,22736,8502,Cata-Fisheye Camera for Panoramic Imaging,2008,"We present a novel panoramic imaging system which uses a curved mirror as a simple optical attachment to a fish- eye lens. When compared to existing panoramic cameras, our 'cata-fisheye camera has a simple, compact and inexpensive design, and yet yields high optical performance. It captures the desired panoramic field of view in two parts. The upper part is obtained directly by the fisheye lens and the lower part after reflection by the curved mirror. These two parts of the field of view have a small overlap that is used to stitch them into a single seamless panorama. The cata-fisheye concept allows us to design cameras with a wide range of fields of view by simply varying the parameters and position of the curved mirror. We provide an automatic method for the one-time calibration needed to stitch the two parts of the panoramic field of view. We have done a complete performance evaluation of our concept with respect to (i) the optical quality of the captured images, (ii) the working range of the camera over which the parallax is negligible, and (iii) the spatial resolution of the computed panorama. Finally, we have built a prototype cata-fisheye video camera with a spherical mirror that can capture high resolution panoramic images (3600times550pixels) with a 360deg (horizontal) x 55deg (vertical) field of view."
1084065,22736,65,Potential human reaction aware mobile robot motion planner: Potential cost minimization framework,2014,"Robots have been stepping steadily into our daily-life. As humans are likely to exist in daily-life scenarios, “human-aware” becomes an essential point for robot navigation in these scenarios. Existing research works on human aware robot navigation rarely take potential human reaction into account in the motion planner. In contrast, we propose in this paper the concept of potential human reaction aware motion planner (PHRAMP), i.e. the robot had better take potential human reaction into account in its motion planning. We propose a general methodology coined as the potential cost minimization (PCM) framework for realizing PHRAMPs. We present some theoretical characteristics of this framework and explain its relationship with existing methods. We describe an instantiation of the PCM framework which serves as a concrete example PHRAMP to demonstrate the utility and advantage of the PCM framework."

Current healthcare robot systems do not address healthcare workflows well and our goal is to provide distributed, heterogeneous multiple robot systems that are capable of integrating with healthcare workflows and are easy to modify when workflow requirements change. The proposed system consists of three subsystems: a receptionist robot system, a nurse assistant robot system, and a medical server. The roles of the receptionist robot and the nurse assistant robot are to do tasks to help the human receptionist and nurse.

2711147,22736,30,Rehand: Realistic electric prosthetic hand created with a 3D printer,2015,"Myoelectric prosthetic hands provide an appearance with five fingers and a grasping function to forearm amputees. However, they have problems in weight, appearance, and cost. This paper reports on the Rehand, a realistic electric prosthetic hand created with a 3D printer. It provides a realistic appearance that is same as the cosmetic prosthetic hand and a grasping function. A simple link mechanism with one linear actuator for grasping and 3D printed parts achieve low cost, light weight, and ease of maintenance.

2084574,22736,65,Human-Robot Interactive Guiding System's Application in Sonar Quick Mapping,2007,"This study introduces the sonar quick mapping method using tethered-robot guiding system, Navi-guider, that is one of the human and robot interactive devices. Basic function of the Navi-guider is to actively control the robot through the tension length and an orientation of the cable. This is able to easily control the mobile robot, is applied to robot controller for quick mapping. Using Navi-guider, user can easily control the mobile robot, but the sonar sensors of the robot head occasionally make the wrong decision to return the incorrectly measured distance between the sensor and an object. Therefore, this paper presents a Altering method, called a cell conjunction Alter (CCF), for building a sonar grid-based map for a mobile robot using Navi-guider. The CCF can recover the wrongly updated map by the incorrect sonar data. The principle of the CCF was based on revaluation of the occupancy possibility in a certain cell through the probabilistic relation among the cells. In this paper, the CCF was applied to a basic grid map construction model, Bayesian model, to verify its effectiveness. Experimental results were also obtained using a mobile robot in a real world environment."
2848455,22736,8806,Towards collective manipulation without inter-agent communication,2016,"This article details the formulation of a decentralized controller for collective manipulation that does not require any communication between agents involved in the task. First, a centralized controller based on the complete system Jacobian is discussed as a benchmark. Then, the centralized controller is reformulated to obtain the algorithm for the proposed decentralized control approach. Both, centralized and decentralized controllers utilize Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to distribute a control action through the agents of the group. The convergence and stability of both controllers are discussed in detail. Moreover, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controllers are investigated through simulating numerous scenarios, formations and populations of the agents. We show that, as the population of the group increases, the results of the decentralized controller approach to its centralized counterpart with significantly lower computational cost."

We introduce the system that UAVs and UGVs remove obstacles cooperatively. In our system, there are multiple type UGVs that have good points and shortcomings, and these UGVs remove a obstacle that block the way. Therefore, our systems can deal with more value of obstacles than existing systems. However our system is more complicated and has many problems to be solved. Therefore, we clarified the problems that our system need to be realized and implemented the robots. The system determines some ways to remove the obstacles using the aerial photograph taken by the UAV and the information of the obstacles by the UGVs, and then outputs a processed aerial photograph and some ways to remove the obstacles. The experimental results reminded us some necessary things for to carry out our goal. Our study has the goal that the autonomous robot team explores under unknown environment such as planetary explorations, or performs search and rescue operations in disaster areas."

This consists of a tactile floor with spatial resolution as a hard- safety sensor for workspace monitoring together with a projection system as a soft- safety component to visualize the boundaries of the safety zones. This safety concept is capable of establishing both manually defined safety zones and dynamically generated safety zones that are based on the current robot's joint positions and velocities, thus offering a maximum of free space around the robot to the user. The paper aims on introducing the novel safety concept and will briefly describe the development of the underlying technologies."
1822512,22736,21106,High dynamic range panoramic imaging,2001,"Most imaging sensors have a limited dynamic range and hence can satisfactorily respond to only a part of illumination levels present in a scene. This is particularly disadvantageous for omnidirectional and panoramic cameras since larger fields of view have larger brightness ranges. We propose a simple modification to existing high resolution omnidirectional/panoramic cameras in which the process of increasing the dynamic range is coupled with the process of increasing the field of view. This is achieved by placing a graded transparency (mask) in front of the sensor which allows every scene point to be imaged under multiple exposure settings as the camera pans, a process anyway required to capture large fields of view at high resolution. The sequence of images are then mosaiced to construct a high resolution, high dynamic range panoramic/omnidirectional image. Our method is robust to alignment errors between the mask and the sensor grid and does not require the mask to be placed on the sensing surface. We have designed a panoramic camera with the proposed modifications and have discussed various theoretical and practical issues encountered in obtaining a robust design. We show with an example of high resolution, high dynamic range panoramic image obtained from the camera we designed."
2951941,22736,65,Anticipatory robot path planning in human environments,2016,"Robot path planning in human environments benefits significantly from considering more than obstacle avoidance, and recent works in this area proposed safety and comfort considerations. One shortcoming of current approaches is that humans' behavior is modeled as independent of robot's motions. In this work, we aim to give this anticipation ability to a robot by simulating people's reaction to robot's motion during planning. Our approach is based on extracting a static plan using A* search on the grid map by minimizing safety, disturbance and path length costs and then refining it by simulating humans' reaction using the Social Force Model. With two example scenarios in simulation and two on the real system, we provide qualitative examination of the resulting robot paths and demonstrate that robots can exhibit social behaviors that is not possible to model with standard approaches. This work serves as a primer for quantitative user studies, and we hope will urge future robot path planners to consider a richer set of social capabilities."
2667610,22736,30,An eight-legged tactile sensor to estimate coefficient of static friction,2015,"It is well known that a tangential force larger than the maximum static friction force is required to initiate the sliding motion between two objects, which is governed by a material constant called the coefficient of static friction. Therefore, knowing the coefficient of static friction is of great importance for robot grippers which wish to maintain a stable and precise grip on an object during various manipulation tasks. Importantly, it is most useful if grippers can estimate the coefficient of static friction without having to explicitly explore the object first, such as lifting the object and reducing the grip force until it slips. A novel eight-legged sensor, based on simplified theoretical principles of friction is presented here to estimate the coefficient of static friction between a planar surface and the prototype sensor. Each of the sensor's eight legs are straight and rigid, and oriented at a specified angle with respect to the vertical, allowing it to estimate one of five ranges (5 = 8/2 + 1) that the coefficient of static friction can occupy. The coefficient of friction can be estimated by determining whether the legs have slipped or not when pressed against a surface. The coefficients of static friction between the sensor and five different materials were estimated and compared to a measurement from traditional methods. A least-squares linear fit of the sensor estimated coefficient showed good correlation with the reference coefficient with a gradient close to one and an r(2) value greater than 0.9."
2946409,22736,9704,Walking speed control in human behavior inspired gait generation system for biped robot,2016,"This paper proposes a gait generation system based on human behavior using biological approach. Humans have different gaits with different levels of speed or step. The proposed gait generator is able to generate the walking transition when the speed and the step length are changing dynamically. Neuron inter-connection structures as the locomotion model are formed. We apply evolutionary computation for each level of walking optimization. In locomotion generator, one joint angle is represented by two coupled neurons. Synaptic weights connected between ten motor neurons represent five joint angles and their gain values required to be optimized during several levels of speed. The optimized walking patterns are combined for acquiring dynamic relationship in one gait generator by using supervised multilayer perceptron (MLP) learning system. This gait generator uses optimized MLP weight parameters to generate synaptic weights transferred to locomotion generator depending on the desired walking speed. In order to prove the effectiveness of the model, we implemented it in computer simulation and in simple humanoid robot. The walking transitions depending on the changes in the walking speed are also shown. The smoothness of walking transition increased compared to previous researches."
2899723,22736,11052,Reliable attribute-based object recognition using high predictive value classifiers,2016,"We consider the problem of object recognition in 3D using an ensemble of attribute-based classifiers. We propose two new concepts to improve classification in practical situations, and show their implementation in an approach implemented for recognition from point-cloud data. First, the viewing conditions can have a strong influence on classification performance. We study the impact of the distance between the camera and the object and propose an approach to fuse multiple attribute classifiers, which incorporates distance into the decision making. Second, lack of representative training samples often makes it difficult to learn the optimal threshold value for best positive and negative detection rate. We address this issue, by setting in our attribute classifiers instead of just one threshold value, two threshold values to distinguish a positive, a negative and an uncertainty class, and we prove the theoretical correctness of this approach. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed concepts."
2988126,22736,9475,High-level planner synthesis for whole-body locomotion in unstructured environments,2016,"Contact-based decision and planning methods are increasingly being sought for task execution in humanoid robots. However, formal methods from the verification and synthesis communities have not been yet incorporated into the motion planning sequence for complex mobility behaviors in humanoid robots. This study takes a step toward formally synthesizing high-level reactive task planners for whole-body locomotion in unstructured environments. We formulate a two-player temporal logic game between the contact planner and its possibly adversarial environment. The resulting discrete planner satisfies the given task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. The resulting commands are executed by a low-level 3D phase-space motion planner algorithm. We devise various low-level locomotion modes based on centroidal momentum dynamics. Provable correctness of the low-level execution of the synthesized discrete task planner is guaranteed through the so-called simulation relations. Simulations of dynamic locomotion in unstructured environments support the effectiveness of the hierarchical planner protocol."

For this purpose, we present a novel visual feedback control structure including a vision-based observer called visual motion observer under the assumption that a pattern of the target motion is available for control. We first focus on evolution of the orientation part and the resulting estimation/control error system is proved to be passive from observer/control input to the estimation/control error output. Accordingly, we also prove that the control objective is achieved by just closing the loop. We then prove convergence of the remaining part of the error system associated with position. Finally, the effectiveness of the present control structure is demonstrated through simulations."
2613651,22736,9475,Spline deformation of locally optimal trajectories: Feasibility and upper bound on control inputs,2015,"Deformation of optimal trajectories has a great potential in various applications due to the ability of real-time recomputation of the overall trajectory when applying new boundary conditions. This paper presents a novel approach where optimal trajectories are created offline through numerical direct optimal control methods. Afterwards the trajectories are deformed online with a spline deformation approach, providing minimum acceleration deviation between optimal and deformed trajectories and considerably reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm during run time. A feasibility check based on upper bounds for the deformed trajectory, the controller tracking error and the resulting torque is provided. This guarantees correct task execution in the presence of bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics."
1354295,22736,11052,Epipolar Geometry of Panoramic Cameras,1998,This paper presents fundamental theory and design of central panoramic cameras. Panoramic cameras combine a convex hyperbolic or parabolic mirror with a perspective camera to obtain a large field of view. We show how to design a panoramic camera with a tractable geometry and we propose a simple calibration method. We derive the image formation function for such a camera. The main contribution of the paper is the derivation of the epipolar geometry between a pair of panoramic cameras. We show that the mathematical model of a central panoramic camera can be decomposed into two central projections and therefore allows an epipolar geometry formulation. It is shown that epipolar curves are conics and their equations are derived. The theory is tested in experiments with real data.
1544468,22736,65,Towards safe physical human-robot interaction: An online optimal control scheme,2012,"Operating in the proximity of humans has been a long-term challenge in robotics research. To achieve this objective, one of the main issues is to ensure safe and comfortable physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). In this paper, we tackle the safety problem at the control level. To ensure operation is within perceived safe zone, we use model predictive control, which finds the optimal control signal online, while imposing predefined safety constraints on the robotic system. The strength of this method lies in allowing the system to perform close to, or at the edge of the constraints' boundaries. In contrast to other works we consider here perceived safety; the constraints for perceived safety are derived in a competitive pHRI experiment. The perceived safety and comfort of the proposed approach is then evaluated with a second, game-like pHRI experiment."
526280,22736,10994,Mirror localization for catadioptric imaging system by observing parallel light pairs,2007,"This paper describes a method of mirror localization to calibrate a catadioptric imaging system. While the calibration of a catadioptric system includes the estimation of various parameters, we focus on the localization of the mirror. The proposed method estimates the position of the mirror by observing pairs of parallel lights, which are projected from various directions. Although some earlier methods for calibrating catadioptric systems assume that the system is single viewpoint, which is a strong restriction on the position and shape of the mirror, our method does not restrict the position and shape of the mirror. Since the constraint used by the proposed method is that the relative angle of two parallel lights is constant with respect to the rigid transformation of the imaging system, we can omit both the translation and rotation between the camera and calibration objects from the parameters to be estimated. Therefore, the estimation of the mirror position by the proposed method is independent of the extrinsic parameters of a camera. We compute the error between the model of the mirror and the measurements, and then estimate the position of the mirror by minimizing this error. We test our method using both simulation and real experiments, and evaluate the accuracy thereof."

708475,22736,65,Mapping human intentions to robot motions via physical interaction through a jointly-held object,2014,"In this paper we consider the problem of human-robot collaborative manipulation of an object, where the human is active in controlling the motion, and the robot is passively following the human's lead. Assuming that the human grasp of the object only allows for transfer of forces and not torques, there is a disambiguity as to whether the human desires translation or rotation. In this paper, we analyze different approaches to this problem both theoretically and in experiment. This leads to the proposal of a control methodology that uses switching between two different admittance control modes based on the magnitude of measured force to achieve disambiguation of the rotation/translation problem."
3008812,22736,9579,A Human-Robot Cooperative Navigation Planner,2017,"Navigation in human environments is a cooperative task and needs to be treated as it is. Humans concurrently assist and comply with each other. To achieve comparable efficiency, a robot needs to predict human trajectories and plan its own trajectory accordingly. We present a navigation planner that is able to plan such cooperative trajectories simultaneously respecting the robot's kinematic constraints and avoiding other non-human dynamic obstacles. Besides adapting the robot trajectory, the planner is also able to proactively propose co-navigation solutions especially in confined spaces."
1696267,22736,21106,Ego-motion and omnidirectional cameras,1998,"Recent research in image sensors has produced cameras with very large fields of view. An area of computer vision research which will benefit from this technology is the computation of camera motion (ego-motion) from a sequence of images. Traditional cameras stiffer from the problem that the direction of translation may lie outside of the field of view, making the computation of camera motion sensitive to noise. In this paper, we present a method for the recovery of ego-motion using omnidirectional cameras. Noting the relationship between spherical projection and wide-angle imaging devices, we propose mapping the image velocity vectors to a sphere, using the Jacobian of the transformation between the projection model of the camera and spherical projection. Once the velocity vectors are mapped to a sphere, we show how existing ego-motion algorithms can be applied and present some experimental results. These results demonstrate the ability to compute ego-motion with omnidirectional cameras."
2931380,22736,65,Real-time placement of a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm,2016,"Picking up an object with a wheelchair mounted robotic arm can be decomposed into a wheelchair navigation task designed to position the robotic arm such that the object is “easy to reach”, and the actual grasp performed by the robotic arm. A convenient definition of the notion of ease of reach can be given by creating a score (ERS) that relies on the number of distinct ways the object can be picked up from a given location. Unfortunately, the accurate calculation of ERS must rely on repeating the path planning process for every candidate position and grasp type, in the presence of obstacles. In this paper we use the bootstrap aggregation over hand-crafted, domain specific features to learn a model for the estimation of ERS. In a simulation study, we show that the estimated ERS closely matches the actual value and the speed of estimation is fast enough for real-time operation, even in the presence of a large number of obstacles in the scene."
2995980,22736,9475,Cascade control for compliant joint robots with redundant position sensors,2016,"The new generation of robots should coexist with our human beings in every walk of life. As a result, physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is ubiquitous and robot safety is quintessential. One solution to safety demand is to voluntarily put the series elasticity into joints for shock absorbing. However, side effects in terms of increased oscillations and long settling time occur. To alleviate this predicament, a compliant joint with two rotary position sensors measuring both the link side and motor side positions is devised. Then, a cascade control consisting of the outer position loop with the joint end position measurement and the inner torque loop is posed to improve the robot performance, and its stability is rigorously analyzed by the singular perturbation theory. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the suggested control scheme."
2672567,22736,9475,Multi-robot manipulation with no communication using only local measurements,2015,"This paper presents a novel approach to coordinate the manipulation forces of a group of robots without explicit communication during a cooperative manipulation task. Robots use the measurements of the motion of the object as the only information to reach a consensus on their forces. It is proven that the consensus can be reached even if all the robots have different velocity and acceleration measurements since they take measurements at different attachment points around the object while the object is rotating and translating. The convergence of the leader-following process where a leader robot actively steers the forces of all follower robots to navigate the object along a desired trajectory is also proven with Lyapunov stability arguments. We verify our method in both numerical simulations and a physics simulator, where we transport a grand piano with 1001 robots."
2584773,22736,20332,Automatic targetless extrinsic calibration of a 3D lidar and camera by maximizing mutual information,2012,"This paper reports on a mutual information (MI) based algorithm for automatic extrinsic calibration of a 3D laser scanner and optical camera system. By using MI as the registration criterion, our method is able to work in situ without the need for any specific calibration targets, which makes it practical for in-field calibration. The calibration parameters are estimated by maximizing the mutual information obtained between the sensor-measured surface intensities. We calculate the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound (CRLB) and show that the sample variance of the estimated parameters empirically approaches the CRLB for a sufficient number of views. Furthermore, we compare the calibration results to independent ground-truth and observe that the mean error also empirically approaches to zero as the number of views are increased. This indicates that the proposed algorithm, in the limiting case, calculates a minimum variance unbiased (MVUB) estimate of the calibration parameters. Experimental results are presented for data collected by a vehicle mounted with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera system."

The visual navigation of a mobile robot is defined as an unconstrained optimization problem to minimize the image difference between the goal position and the position of a mobile robot in the image plane. Full New ton's method is applied for unconstrained optimization. We also propose a method to find the Hessian term of the image error using a secant approximation method.

A simple extension allows to cope with mul-tiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF) patterns, where allDOFs share the same fundamental frequency but,otherwise, can move in arbitrary phase and ampli-tude o sets to each other. We evaluate our meth-ods in learning from demonstration with an actual30 DOF humanoid robot. Figure-8 and drummingmovements are demonstrated by a human, recordedin joint angle space with an exoskeleton, and em-bedded in multi-dimensional rhythmic pattern gener-ators. The learned patterns can be used by the robotin various workspace locations and from arbitraryinitial conditions. Spatial and temporal invarianceof the pattern generators allow easy amplitude andspeed scaling without losing the qualitative signatureof a movement. This novel way of creating rhyth-mic patterns could tremendously facilitate rhythmicmovement generation, in particular in locomotion ofrobots and neural prosthetics in clinical applications."
925923,22736,23735,Robotic neuro-emdoscope with concentric tube augmentation,2012,"Surgical robots are gaining favor in part due to their capacity to reach remote locations within the body. Continuum robots are especially well suited for accessing deep spaces such as cerebral ventricles within the brain. Due to the entry point constraints and complicated structure, current techniques do not allow surgeons to access the full volume of the ventricles. The ability to access the ventricles with a dexterous robot would have significant clinical implications. This paper presents a concentric tube manipulator mated to a robotically controlled flexible endoscope. The device adds three degrees of freedom to the standard neuroendoscope and roboticizes the entire package allowing the operator to conveniently manipulate the device. To demonstrate the improved functionality, we use an in-silica virtual model as well as an ex-vivo anatomic model of a patient with a treatable form of hydrocephalus. In these experiments we demonstrate that the augmented and roboticized endoscope can efficiently reach critical regions that a manual scope cannot."
957118,22736,23735,Design of Photovoltaic Cells to Power Control Electronics Embedded in Untethered Aqueous Microrobots Propelled by Bacteria,2006,"The preliminary design of photovoltaic cells to be embedded in untethered aqueous microrobots, a few hundred micrometers in overall length, is briefly described. A total of 4 cells with an estimated efficiency of 12.5% should provide up to 100 microamperes of photonic current to the electronics embedded in each untethered microrobot from an incident source of green light. The need for power has been minimized through the use of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) acting as embedded micro-actuators to propel the microrobots in an aqueous medium. Controlling the direction of propulsion with the onboard electronics would be performed by exploiting magnetotaxis inherent in MTB. Here, a small electrical current provided by the photovoltaic cells and flowing in a controlled manner in a special embedded conductor network would be sufficient to exert a torque on a chain of magnetosomes in each bacterium. Such approach allows us to independently change their direction of motion when pushing each microrobot."
735405,22736,65,Appropriate emotions for facial expressions of 33-DOFs android head EveR-4 H33,2012,"There are many theories about basic emotions, and we do not know which emotions are appropriate to use. Also, faces of robots are designed differently and require different ways to embody emotional expressions. Therefore, in this paper we address the appropriate emotions for facial expressions of EveR-4 H33, which is controlled by thirty-three motors for head system. EveR-4 H33 displays her facial expressions for certain emotions selected from typical basic emotion theories. Then, audiences at an exhibition evaluate her facial expressions, by enjoying a game of emotional correction. We analyze the results of the game, and decide appropriate emotions for EveR-4 H33."
2373175,22736,65,Tabulation and analysis of questionnaire results of subjective evaluation of seal robot in seven countries,2008,"This paper describes research on a ldquomental commitment robotrdquo. These robots have a different target audience to industrial robots, one that is not so rigidly dependent on objective measures such as accuracy and speed. The main goal of this research is to explore a new area in robotics, with the emphasis on human-robot interaction. In previous research, we classified robots into four categories, which related to their appearance. We then introduced a robot cat and a robot seal, which we evaluated by interviewing a large group of people. The results showed that physical interaction improved their subjective evaluation of the robots. Moreover, a priori knowledge of a subject has a considerable influence on the subjective interpretation and evaluation of mental commitment robots. In this paper, we asked several groups of subjects to evaluate the seal robot known as dasiaParopsila by answering questionnaires that were given out in exhibitions that were held in seven different countries; Japan, U.K., Sweden, Italy, Korea, Brunei and U.S. This paper reports the results of statistical analysis of the evaluation data."
2242922,22736,23735,Influence of a priori knowledge in subjective interpretation and evaluation by short-term interaction with mental commit robot,2000,"Recent advances in robotics have been applied to automation in industrial manufacturing, with the primary purpose of optimizing practical systems in terms of such objective measures as accuracy, speed, and cost. This paper introduces research on mental commit robot that seeks a different direction that is not so rigidly dependent on such objective measures. The main goal of this research is to explore a new area in robotics, with an emphasis on human-robot interaction. In the previous research, we introduced a cat robot and evaluated it by interviewing many people. The results showed that physical interaction improved subjective evaluation. However, some subjects gave severe comments on structure of the robot when they interacted with it physically. Because of appearance of cat robot, subjects associated with a real cat depending on their own experiences and knowledge, and then compared the robot with real cat. This paper investigates influence of a priori knowledge into subjective interpretation and evaluation of mental commit robot. We developed a new seal robot that has appearance of a baby of harp seal. Most people did not know harp seal exactly nor have experience of interaction with it. Then, subjects evaluated the seal robot while interacting with it."
2093863,22736,65,An analysis of perceptual cues in robot group selection tasks,2015,"The aim of the proposed investigation is to provide the users with the capability of creating robot teams “on- the-fly” using grouping strategies expressed through speech. Our working hypothesis is that people are inclined to assemble objects into macro-entities, or groups, according to perceptual principles. We observed the real linguistic utterances used by individuals in a testing environment, showing that the type of robots and their mutual arrangements can affect both the choice of elements to form a team, and the way such choice is made. Moreover, we provide an initial insight for the capabilities needed by a robot for reasoning about its membership in a team."
2257423,22736,65,Continual planning for cross-modal situated clarification in human-robot interaction,2008,"Robots do not fully understand the world they are situated in. This includes what humans talk to them about. A fundamental problem is thus how a robot can clarify such a lack of understanding. This paper addresses the issue of how a robot can create a plan for resolving a need for clarification. It characterises situated clarification as an information need which may arise in any sensory-motoric modality required to interpret the situated context of the robot, or any deliberative modality referring to that context. It then focuses on how, once a clarification need has been identified, the robot can create a plan in which one or more modalities are used to resolve it. Modalities are involved on the basis of the types of information they can provide. These information types are identified in the ontologies the modalities use to interconnect their content with content of other modalities (via information fusion). We take a continual approach to planning and execution monitoring. This provides the ability to re-plan depending on modality availability and success in resolving (part of) a clarification need. We illustrate the implementation on several examples."
936043,22736,65,AOA: Ambient obstacle avoidance interface,2014,"In this paper, we present a novel interface for teleoperating ground vehicles. Obstacle avoidance with ground vehicles demands a high level of operator attention, typically distracting from the primary mission. The Ambient Obstacle Avoidance (AOA) was designed to allow operators to effectively perform a primary task, such as search, while still effectively avoiding obstacles. The AOA wraps around a standard video interface and provides range information without requiring a separate screen. AOA combines and reduces different data streams into proportionately scaled symbology that directly shows important relationships between vehicle width, vehicle orientation and obstacles in the environment. The use of the AOA interface was tested in both simulation and on physical robots. Results from both tests show an improvement in obstacle avoidance during navigation with the AOA. In addition, results from the simulation test indicate that operators using AOA were able to leverage ambient vision such that the primary visual task was not impeded."
2182027,22736,65,Vib-Touch: Virtual Active Touch interface for handheld devices,2009,"Haptic interaction with handheld devices is limited by space and size constraints that inhibit free hand exploration. We developed a compact haptic interface called Vib-Touch, which is operated by fingertip via a pointing-stick input device containing a tactile feedback. A cursor on the screen could perform virtual exploration as a substitute for the finger movement. We call this technology Virtual Active Touch. We also propose a tactile stimulation method to represent not only tactile sensations, but the whole touch experience, including kinesthetic senses and a sense of shapes perceived by a fingertip. This study reports on the first prototype of the Vib-Touch interface for handheld devices. We confirmed that the prototype could provide friction sensation and geometric shape information using the proposed friction display method."
2004251,22736,65,Learning linguistic constructions grounded in qualitative action models,2015,"Aiming at the design of adaptive artificial agents which are able to learn autonomously from experience and human tutoring, in this paper we present a system for learning syntactic constructions grounded in perception. These constructions are learned from examples of natural language utterances and parallel performances of actions, i.e. their trajectories and involved objects. From the input, the system learns linguistic structures and qualitative action models. Action models are represented as Hidden Markov Models over sequences of qualitative relations between a trajector and a landmark and abstract away from concrete action trajectories. Learning of action models is driven by linguistic observations, and linguistic patterns are, in turn, grounded in learned action models. The proposed system is applicable for both language understanding and language generation. We present empirical results, showing that the learned action models generalize well over concrete instances of the same action and also to novel performers, while allowing accurate discrimination between different actions. Further, we show that the system is able to describe novel dynamic scenes and to understand novel utterances describing such scenes."
2930729,22736,9475,Shape-based compliant control with variable coordination centralization on a snake robot,2016,"For highly articulated robots, there is a tradeoff between the capability to navigate complex unstructured environments and the high computational cost of coordinating many degrees-of-freedom. In this work, an approach that we refer to as shape-based control helps to balance this trade-off using shape functions, geometric abstractions that determine the coupling between multiple degrees-of-freedom during locomotion. This approach provides a way to intuitively adapt the shape of highly articulated robots using joint-level torque feedback control, allowing a robot to compliantly feel its way through unstructured terrain. In this work we specifically focus on compliance in the spatial frequency and temporal phase parameters of a snake-like robot's wave-like periodic wave-like kinematics. We show how varying the spatial frequency within the shape-based control architecture allows a single controller to vary the degree to which different degrees-of-freedom are coupled throughout a mechanism's body, i.e., the controller's degree of centralization. We experimentally find that for a snake-like robot locomoting through an irregularly spaced peg array, shape-based control results in more effective locomotion when compared to a central pattern generator-based approach."
781659,22736,65,Development of a new 6 DOF parallel haptic interface for the rendering of elements and interior equipment in a car,2013,"We present the design, analysis, control and characterization of a general purpose, six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) haptic interface for the rendering of elements and interior equipment like sliders, drawers, eyeglass holders or gloveboxes in a car. One of the major challenges in the design of six DoF haptic interfaces is the trade-off between workspace size, stiffness, output capability, and bandwidth. In order to meet this challenge we propose a new kinematic structure that allows to cover a relatively large workspace in both rotational and translational degrees of freedom, while ensuring high velocity and force output capabilities to render a wide range of impedances. An admittance controller with model-based gravity and Coriolis compensation is implemented to render different types of elements and interior equipment in a car. Hardware-related performance measures like dexterous workspace and output capabilities are derived based on kinematic and dynamic simulations and are compared to state-of-the-art devices."
2929546,22736,30,Design and development of a sensorized cylindrical object for grasping assessment,2016,"Aim of this work is to design and develop an instrumented cylindrical object equipped with force sensors, which is able to assess grasping performance of both human and robotic hands. The object is made of two concentric shells between which sixteen piezoresistive sensors have been located in order to measure the forces applied by the hand fingers during grasping. Furthermore, a magneto-inertial unit has been positioned inside the object for acquiring information about object orientation during manipulation. A wireless communication between the electronic boards, responsible for acquiring the data from the sensors, and a remote laptop has been guaranteed. The object has been conceived in such a way to be adopted for evaluating both power and precision grasps and for measuring the forces applied by each finger of the hand. In order to evaluate object performance, a finite element analysis for estimating the deformation of the external shell for different force values has been carried out. Moreover, to evaluate object sensitivity, a static analysis of the force transmitted by the external shell to the underlying sensors has been performed by varying the thickness of the shells. The obtained preliminary results have validated the feasibility of using the developed object for assessing grasping performed by human and robotic hands."
1507540,22736,65,A Linear Dynamic Affect-Expression Model: Facial Expressions According to Perceived Emotions in Mascot-Type Facial Robots,2007,"It is expected that robots will be widely exposed to humans in the near future. Emotional communication is very important in human-robot interaction, as well as human- human interaction. Facial expression is an emotional expression method between humans, and it also enables human to recognize a robot's emotional state. Although there are lots of previous research regarding facial expressions, it is not easily applicable to different shapes of robot faces, if the number and types of the robot's control points are varied. In addition, the natural connection between emotions has not been considered or has been inefficiently implemented in previous research. In this paper, we propose a linear dynamic affect-expression model for continuous change of expression and diversifying characteristics of expressional changes. Therefore, the proposed model allows a robot's facial expression and expression changes to more closely resemble those of humans, and this model is applicable to various mascot-type robots irrespective of the number and types of robot's control points."
1993694,22736,65,Biologically inspired models and hardware for emotive facial expressions,2005,"Socially intelligent robots are no longer an interesting topic of science fiction. In the robotics community, there is a growing interest in building personal robots, or in building robots that share the same workspace with humans. Natural interaction between humans and robots is therefore essential. To interact socially with humans, a robot must be able to do more than simply gather information about its surroundings; it must be able to express its states or emotions so that humans believe it has beliefs, desires, and intentions of its own. In the last decade, many researchers have focused on generating emotive facial expressions, which are known as the best cues for conveying the robot's state, intentions, feelings and emotions. This paper gives a brief overview of current robotic systems with emotive facial expressions and introduces the basic models and hardware of two different types of facial robotic systems."
1951149,22736,10174,Integrated motion planning and coordination for industrial vehicles,2014,"A growing interest in the industrial sector for autonomous ground vehicles has prompted significant investment in fleet management systems. Such systems need to accommodate on-line externally imposed temporal and spatial requirements, and to adhere to them even in the presence of contingencies. Moreover, a fleet management system should ensure correctness, i.e., refuse to commit to requirements that cannot be satisfied. We present an approach to obtain sets of alternative execution patterns (called trajectory envelopes) which provide these guarantees. The approach relies on a constraint-based representation shared among multiple solvers, each of which progressively refines trajectory envelopes following a least commitment principle."

The sensor-based behavior cannot be represented by a simple sequence of motions. Action mode representation and ROBOL/0 language are a powerful method to represent such sensor-based behavior. Autonomous navigation with the obstacle avoidance function is designed and represented using action modes. To show the effectiveness of the method, it is programmed in ROBOL/0 and executed on a real robot. >"

First they describe the problems of escaping from a situation where an object cannot be grasped and the actions to solve them. Then they propose a new method for planning manipulator motions for these actions using sliding operations based on geometrical information about the environments. The results of the method and its validity are shown.
2239313,22736,23735,Approaches for heuristically biasing RRT growth,2003,This paper presents several modifications to the basic rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) search algorithm. The fundamental idea is to utilize a heuristic quality function to guide the search. Results from a relevant simulation experiment illustrate the benefit and drawbacks of the developed algorithms. The paper concludes with several promising directions for future research.

It is difficult to know the location and direction of an obstacle with an ultrasonic sensor, since distance is the only information provided by the sensor. The authors propose here a method for estimating the location and direction of a wire obstacle by using multiple items of information on distance. The authors report the results of simulation of path modification by detecting wire obstacles based on the proposed method."

We test the idea of robotic enzymes using a virtual environment that simulates the currently existing modular robots in a physically accurate way. We describe the self-replicating features of robotic enzymes, and how they could be used to autonomously self-replicate for multiple generations, limited only by the amount of modules in the environment."

Concurrent path and sensor planning is a very challenging problem, since realistic models of platforms, sensors and environment are very complex and inherently non-linear. Our approach is one attempt to address these issues and formulate an optimization problem using tools from information theory."

The Albert HUBO adopts the techniques of the HUBO design for Albert HUBO body and the techniques of Hanson robotics for Albert HUBO's head. Its height and weight are 137 cm and 57 Kg. Albert HUBO has 66 DOFs (31 for head motions and 35 for body motions) And head part uses `fubber' materials for smooth artificial skin and 28 servo motors for face movements and 3 servo motors for neck movements are used for generating a full range of facial expressions such as laugh, sadness, angry, surprised, etc. and body is modified with HUBO(KHR-3) introduced in 2004 to join with Albert HUBO's head and 35 DC motors are embedded for imitating various human-like body motions"
2810191,22736,10174,C-FOREST: Parallel Shortest-Path Planning with Super Linear Speedup.,2014,"In (Otte and Correll 2013) we present C-FOREST, a parallelization framework for single-query sampling-based shortest-path planning algorithms. C-FOREST has been observed to have super linear speedup on many problems, e.g., paths of quality Ltarget are found 350X faster by 64 CPUs working in parallel than by 1 CPU. In (Otte and Correll 2013) C-FOREST is tested in conjunction with the RRT* algorithm. In the current work we perform additional experiments that show C-FOREST provides similar advantages when used conjunction with the SPRT algorithm. This reinforces our original claim that C-FOREST is generally applicable to a wide range of sampling based motion planning algorithms."

As part of a developing course at Brown University, we have created the Roomba Pac-Man task to introduce students to different approaches to autonomous robot control in the context of a specific task. Roomba Pac-Man has been developed using commodity hardware from which students explore standard methods in robotics, namely subsumption, localization, and path planning. Our development of Roomba Pac-Man is founded upon grounding robotics in an compelling and accessible application in a noncontrived real-world environment in a manner than can be reproduced, giving students a sense of ownership."

This paper presents the generation method of animal gait for quadrupedal robot. Here, we have employed AIBO as experimental quadrupedal robot and created the gait of AIBO in imitation of animal gait. At first, We have optimized the orbit of mono-leg, which can output propulsive force efficiently, by imitating dog gait and genetic algorithm. Moreover, We have generated the quadrupedal gait of AIBO using both the optimum orbit of mono-leg and animalpsilas gait, which is classified the gait of walking dog based on the zoology. And furthermore, we have performed questionnaires to include the human feeling, and chosen the best gait for AIBOpsilas animal walking from among the above-mentioned various dogpsilas gait."
2547359,22736,9078,Geometric construction of the caustic curves for catadioptric sensors,2004,"Most of the catadioptric cameras rely on the single view-point constraint that is hardly fulfilled. There exists many works on non single viewpoint catadioptric sensors satisfying specific resolutions. The computation of the caustic curve becomes essential if precision and flexibility are aimed. Existing solutions are unfortunately too specific to a class of curves and need heavy precomputations. This paper presents a flexible geometric construction of the caustic surface of a catadioptric sensor that can be applied to the plane curves and under a tighter assumption, to space surfaces. The method holds for smooth mirror shapes that are surfaces of revolution. Tests and experimental results substantiate the possibilities of the approach."
649483,22736,65,On human performance in tactile language learning and tactile memory,2014,"This paper reports on the findings from an experiment on human performance in tactile language learning and tactile memory. A set of vibrotactile patterns representing verbal words was presented to a group of 20 voluntary subjects. Upon learning, subjects were capable of recognizing the patterns with high accuracy. Patterns were then combined with the aim of constructing sentences that gradually represent more complex ideas. Recognition rates remained satisfactory. A novel approach of tactile stimuli was explored: podotactile stimulation. For this study, a prototype of wearable electronic tactile display that stimulates the mechanoreceptors in the foot sole with vibrations was used. Results obtained suggest that it is possible to construct tactile languages that could be useful in human-computer interaction and wearable/mobile computing."
2446214,22736,21106,Caustics of catadioptric cameras,2001,"Conventional vision systems and algorithms assume the camera to have a single viewpoint. However, sensors need not always maintain a single viewpoint. For instance, an incorrectly aligned system could cause non-single viewpoints. Also, systems could be designed to specifically deviate from a single viewpoint to trade-off image characteristics such as resolution and field of view. In these cases, the locus of viewpoints forms what is called a caustic. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of caustics of catadioptric cameras with conic reflectors. Properties of caustics with respect to field of view and resolution are presented. Finally, we present ways to calibrate conic catadioptric systems and estimate their caustics from known camera motion."
1116388,22736,9616,Small Object Discovery and Recognition Using Actively Guided Robot,2014,"In the field of active perception, object search is a widely studied problem. To search for an object in large rooms, it would be expensive to explore and check each object's similarity with the object of interest. The expense could uncontrollably bloat as the number of objects to be searched increases. If the objects are of the order of a 2-5cm, they appear very small, making it difficult for the present algorithms to recognize them. A general human strategy in such cases is to sparsely identify, from far away (4-6m), if the object of interest is present in the scene. Subsequently, each of the possible objects is analysed from closer proximity to recognize, for further manipulation. In this work, we present a similar framework. We reduce search-space, by identifying existential probability of a small object from a distance followed by a closer 3-D analysis of its point cloud to accurately recognize it. This is achieved by 2-D modelling of the objects using Gaussian Mixture Models followed by recognizing objects using efficient RGB-Depth based algorithm."
2263910,22736,9015,Programming micro-aerial vehicle swarms with karma,2011,"Research in micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) construction, control, and high-density power sources is enabling swarms of MAVs as a new class of mobile sensing systems. For efficient operation, such systems must adapt to dynamic environments, cope with uncertainty in sensing and control, and operate with limited resources. We propose a novel system architecture based on a  hive-drone  model that simplifies the functionality of an individual MAV to a sequence of sensing and actuation commands with  no in-field communication . This decision simplifies the hardware and software complexity of individual MAVs and moves the complexity of coordination entirely to a central hive computer. We present  Karma , a system for programming and managing MAV swarms. Through simulation and testbed experiments we demonstrate how applications in Karma can run on limited resources, are robust to individual MAV failure, and adapt to changes in the environment."
2911796,22736,22279,Ear in the sky: Ego-noise reduction for auditory micro aerial vehicles,2016,"We investigate the spectral and spatial characteristics of the ego-noise of a multirotor micro aerial vehicle (MAV) using audio signals captured with multiple onboard microphones and derive a noise model that grounds the feasibility of microphone-array techniques for noise reduction. The spectral analysis suggests that the ego-noise consists of narrowband harmonic noise and broadband noise, whose spectra vary dynamically with the motor rotation speed. The spatial analysis suggests that the ego-noise of a P-rotor MAV can be modeled as P directional noises plus one diffuse noise. Moreover, because of the fixed positions of the microphones and motors, we can assume that the acoustic mixing network of the ego-noise is stationary. We validate the proposed noise model and the stationary mixing assumption by applying blind source separation to multi-channel recordings from both a static and a moving MAV and quantify the signal-to-noise ratio improvement. Moreover, we make all the audio recordings publicly available."

In this paper we demonstrate the on-going work in developing novel collective systems, where swarm robots work not only collectively, but are also capable of autonomous aggregation and disaggregation into a higher multi- robot organism. The main issues of such an organism, as well as its genome-based control, are discussed. We show the developed docking approach and investigate topological transformations in a prototype of self-assembling robots."
2762863,22736,10174,Mixed-Initiative Planning and Execution for Multiple Drones in Search and Rescue Missions.,2015,"We present a mixed-initiative planning and execution system for human multi-drones interaction during search and rescue missions. The proposed system should allow a single operator to supervise and orchestrate the operations of a set of UAVs by means of a natural multimodal communication. In particular, we consider the task of searching for missing persons in a real-world alpine scenario. In this context, we assume that the human operator is an alpine rescuer, involved in the scene and co-located with the drones, hence not fully dedicated to the robotic platforms, but only able to provide sparse and sketchy interventions. This scenario requires a framework that supports adjustable autonomy, from explicit teleoperation to a complete autonomy, and an effective and natural mixed-initiative interaction between the human and the robotic team. In this paper, we illustrate the domain and the overall framework discussing the system at work in a simulated case study."
1881287,22736,65,Efficient parsing of spoken inputs for human-robot interaction,2009,"The use of deep parsers in spoken dialogue systems is usually subject to strong performance requirements. This is particularly the case in human-robot interaction, where the computing resources are limited and must be shared by many components in parallel. A real-time dialogue system must be capable of responding quickly to any given utterance, even in the presence of noisy, ambiguous or distorted input. The parser must therefore ensure that the number of analyses remains bounded at every processing step. The paper presents a practical approach to addressing this issue in the context of deep parsers designed for spoken dialogue. The approach is based on a word lattice parser combined with a statistical model for parse selection. Each word lattice is parsed incrementally, word by word, and a discriminative model is applied at each incremental step to prune the set of resulting partial analyses. The model incorporates a wide range of linguistic and contextual features and can be trained with a simple perceptron. The approach is fully implemented as part of a spoken dialogue system for human-robot interaction. Evaluation results on a Wizard-of-Oz test suite demonstrate significant improvements in parsing time."
1447642,22736,9475,Global path planning for competitive robotic cars,2013,"In this paper, we consider the optimal motion planning problem for an autonomous race car. A competitive autonomous car must acquire environmental and opponent information to compute, in real time, the minimum time collision free path and the low level control to track the chosen path. To cope with those requirements, we first solve the problem for a car running in isolation considering the optimal sequence of manoeuvres to approach bends and straight stretches of track. We then propose a discrete abstraction to derive a problem of graph optimisation that has a very efficient, albeit suboptimal, solution. In this context, an overtake manoeuvre against a slower car will be obtained excluding from the path the arcs that could potentially generate a collision. Finally, a control algorithm is used to ensure that the car always remains close to the planned path."
1305372,22736,9475,Frame induced vibration estimation and attenuation scheme on a multirotor helicopter,2014,"The aim of this article is to establish an induced frame vibration and attenuation scheme, specifically targeting the area of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as quadrotors. These types of unmanned small scale helicopters are characterized by small and light frames, which are vulnerable to vibrations induced by the operation of the motors or external environmental factors. The existence of such vibrations effecting the frame can significantly deteriorate the performance of the overall closed system and even drive it to instabilities. In this article spectral estimation schemes based on: a) Autoregressive (AR) modeling and b) Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) are being established and evaluated towards their ability to detect the induced vibration frequencies on the UAV, while an extended discussion is being presented on selecting the correct number of the identified induced vibrating frequencies. In a sequential stage, a vibration attenuation approach based on notch filtering is being presented, being able to correctly attenuate the induced vibrating frequencies in the measurements. The efficiency of the overall suggested scheme is being evaluated by experimental results that indicate the significant improvement in the measurements achieved by the direct application of the proposed scheme."
2830686,22736,20332,Distributed Aggregation in the Presence of Uncertainty: A Statistical Physics Approach,2012,"We present a statistical physics inspired approach to modeling, analysis, and design of distributed aggregation control policies for teams of homogeneous and heterogeneous robots. We assume high-level agent behavior can be described as a sequential composition of lower-level behavioral primitives. Aggregation or division of the collective into distinct clusters is achieved by developing a macroscopic description of the ensemble dynamics. The advantages of this approach are twofold: 1) the derivation of a low dimensional but highly predictive description of the collective dynamics and 2) a framework where interaction uncertainties between the low-level components can be explicitly modeled and control. Additionally, classical dynamical systems theory and control theoretic techniques can be used to analyze and shape the collective dynamics of the system. We consider the aggregation problem for homogeneous agents into clusters located at distinct regions in the workspace and discuss the extension to heterogeneous teams of autonomous agents. We show how a macroscopic model of the aggregation dynamics can be derived from agent-level behaviors and discuss the synthesis of distributed coordination strategies in the presence of uncertainty."
1848424,22736,65,Age and gender factors in user acceptance of healthcare robots,2009,"Human-robot interaction (HRI) and user acceptance become critical when service robots start to provide a variety of assistance to users on a personal level. Limited research to date has studied the influence of users' attributes (such as age and gender) on the acceptance of service robots and the implications for HRI design. This paper describes the development of a social interactive healthcare robot named Charles, capable of measuring blood pressure. Using blood pressure monitoring as the service scenario, a user study was conducted to investigate the differences between two age groups (40 to 65 years and over 65 years) in attitudes and reactions before and after their interactions with Charles. The results showed few differences between the two age groups. A significant gender effect was found, with males having a more positive attitude toward robots in healthcare than females. This study reveals the importance of considering gender issues in the design of healthcare robots for older people. Overall, the performance of the robot was rated high, however the participants expressed desires to have more interactiveness and a better voice from the robot. According to our sample, age need not be a barrier to users' acceptance of healthcare robots."
990366,22736,9616,Development of a guide dog system for the blind people with character recognition ability,2004,"This paper introduces a guide dog system with character recognition ability. The main purpose of this system is to assist blind people. A guide dog helps a visually impaired person to act corresponding to the surrounding environment. However, it cannot do complex tasks such as reading words. We constructed a system that can read characters to support them. Usually, character recognition systems segment character from the general background by using some information. This time, our system focuses exclusively on reading a room number. Therefore, we used a method of character searching by template matching."
2959858,22736,65,Implicit robot selection for human multi-robot interaction in Search and Rescue missions,2016,"We present a system suitable for human multi-robot interaction that supports the operator in the robot selection process. The proposed framework allows a human to issue commands to a robotic team without an explicit robot selection in so enabling a fluent interaction. This work is framed in the operative context of the SHERPA project [1], which proposes the deployment of a robotic platform for Search & Rescue in an alpine scenario and assumes the presence of a human rescuer that can orchestrate the robots operations with multimodal commands. In this context, implicit robot selection is mainly motivated by fast communication and the difficulties to distinguish different robots of similar shape in a hazardous environment and in adverse weather conditions. In the proposed approach, each robot of the team can evaluate the probability to be referred in an incomplete command, considering its actual capabilities along with geometrical and contextual information. We describe the overall system architecture focusing on the human intention recognition process. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated in a simulated case study."
2392454,22736,65,Modularity and integration in the design of a socially interactive robot,2005,"Designing robots that are capable of interacting with humans in real life settings is a challenging task. One key issue is the integration of multiple modalities (e.g., mobility, physical structure, navigation, vision, audition, dialogue, reasoning) into a coherent framework. Taking the AAAI mobile robot challenge (making a robot attend the national conference on artificial intelligence) as the experimental context, we are currently addressing hardware, software and computation integration issues involved in designing a robot capable of sophisticated interaction with humans. This paper reports on our design solutions and the current status of the work, along with the potential impacts this design on human-robot interaction research."
412550,22736,11187,Neural dynamics based exploration algorithm for a mobile robot,2007,"A primary goal for an autonomous mobile robot is to explore and perfrom simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). During SLAM, the robot must balance the opposing desires of pose certainty maintenance and information gain. Much of previous research has ignored the need of pose maintenance. This paper provides the first step in developing a neural dynamics based algorithm which considers both information gain and pose maintenance when determining the robot's next pose. Simulation results show that the algorithm is able to provide the robot with an exploration plan to fully explore the tested environments. The next step is to apply the algorithm in a full SLAM environment."
2688664,22736,9579,Homotopy-Aware RRT*: Toward Human-Robot Topological Path-Planning,2016,"An important problem in human-robot interaction is for a human to be able to tell the robot go to a particular location with instructions on how to get there or what to avoid on the way. This paper provides a solution to problems where the human wants the robot not only to optimize some objective but also to honor soft or hard topological constraints, i.e. go quickly from A to B while avoiding C. The paper presents the HARRT* (homotopy-aware RRT*) algorithm, which is a computationally scalable algorithm that a robot can use to plan optimal paths subject to the information provided by the human. The paper provides a theoretic justification for the key property of the algorithm, proposes a heuristic for RRT*, and uses a set of simulation case studies of the resulting algorithm to make a case for why these properties are compatible with the requirements of human-robot interactive path-planning."
801016,22736,9475,On the use of FES to attenuate tremor by modulating joint impedance,2011,"In this paper, we describe a closed-loop pathological tremor attenuation system using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). The proposed strategy, which is based on the modulation of joint impedance using FES, was developed after experimental evidence was obtained on open-loop trials with tremor patients. The method relies firstly on an online tremor estimation algorithm, which also filters the voluntary motion performed by the patient. Based on this information, the impedance of the trembling joint may be increased accordingly by applying the appropriate stimulation parameters on a pair of antagonist muscles that act on the joint, thus attenuating the effects of tremor. An experimental evaluation of the system, which involved 4 healthy subjects and 1 tremor patient, is also presented."
407809,22736,10994,Indoor scene classification using combined 3D and gist features,2010,"Scene categorization is an important mechanism for providing high-level context which can guide methods for a more detailed analysis of scenes. State-of-the-art techniques like Torralba's Gist features show a good performance on categorizing outdoor scenes but have problems in categorizing indoor scenes. In contrast to object based approaches, we propose a 3D feature vector capturing general properties of the spatial layout of indoor scenes like shape and size of extracted planar patches and their orientation to each other. This idea is supported by psychological experiments which give evidence for the special role of 3D geometry in categorizing indoor scenes. In order to study the influence of the 3D geometry we introduce in this paper a novel 3D indoor database and a method for defining 3D features on planar surfaces extracted in 3D data. Additionally, we propose a voting technique to fuse 3D features and 2D Gist features and show in our experiments a significant contribution of the 3D features to the indoor scene categorization task."
2940041,22736,11470,Depth-aware indoor staircase detection and recognition for the visually impaired,2016,"A mobile vision-based navigation aid is capable of assisting the visually impaired to travel independently, especially in unfamiliar environments. Despite many effective navigation algorithms having been developed in recent decades, accurate, efficient, and reliable staircase detection in indoor navigation still remains to be a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an effective indoor staircase detection algorithm based on an RGB-D camera. The candidates of staircases are first detected from RGB frames by extracting a set of concurrent parallel lines based on Hough transform. The complement depth frames are further employed to recognize the staircase candidates as upstairs, downstairs, and negatives (i.e., corridors). A support vector machine (SVM) based multi-classifier is trained and tested for the staircase recognition with our newly collected staircase dataset. The detection and recognition results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."
2683294,22736,9475,Mobile robot navigation amidst humans with intents and uncertainties: A time scaled collision cone approach,2015,"We propose a novel collision avoidance formulation in the intent space, suitable for navigation of non-holonomic robots in human centered environments. The intent space is characterized by various bands of trajectories wherein each band can be thought to be a representation of a possible human intended motion and the uncertainty associated with it. We ascribe probabilities to human intentions and characterize the uncertainty around it through Gaussian state transition and its concomitant Gaussian parametric distribution. Given an intent space we design avoidance maneuvers based on our recent works on time scaled collision cone concept which provides analytical characterization of collision free velocities in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present a probabilistic variant of the time scaled collision cone which allows us to relate space of collision free velocities to an associated confidence measure. We also develop an optimization framework which extract such specific solutions from the entire solution space that achieves an elegant balance between the objective of minimizing risk and ease of avoidance maneuver. We further show that by accounting for possible intents in human motion, the method transcends the realm of reactive avoidance to proactive anticipation of collisions and its effective avoidance, thereby increasing the overall safety of navigation."
1181535,22736,9078,3D object matching based on spherical Hilbert scanning,2010,"This paper describes a novel method to match objects in cluttered scenes. This method makes use of Hilbert scanning of feature points in Hough space. We use a 3D Hough transform to obtain a spectrum on which 3D features are concentrated on the sphere. Then, based on the obtained Hough Spectrum, we apply Hilbert scanning on the sphere to match the objects. Using this approach, we can match the object correctly and robustly in both overlapping and noise situation. The characteristic of this method is that it is a global matching method without an estimate of the rotation first and suffering from computational complexity brought by voting/correlation procedure. The experiment results show that the method is more effective compared to existing methods in both matching rate and robustness."
1638421,22736,9080,Evolving joint-level control with digital muscles,2014,"The neuromuscular systems of animals are governed by extremely complex networks of control signals, sensory feedback loops, and mechanical interactions. Morphology and control are inherently intertwined. In the case of animal joints, groups of muscles work together to provide power and stability to move limbs in a coordinated manner. In contrast, many robot controllers handle both high-level planning and low-level control of individual joints. In this paper, we propose a joint-level control method, called digital muscles, that operates in a manner analogous to biological muscles, yet is abstract enough to apply to conventional robotic joints. An individual joint is controlled by multiple muscle nodes, each of which responds to a control signal according to a node-specific activation function. Evolving the physical orientation of muscle nodes and their respective activation functions enables relatively complex and coordinated gaits to be realized with simple high-level control. Even using a sinusoid as the high-level control signal, we demonstrate the evolution of effective gaits for a simulated quadruped. The proposed model realizes a control strategy for governing the behavior of individual joints, and can be coupled with a high-level controller that focuses on decision making and planning."
2938410,22736,30,Design of a bio-inspired pneumatic artificial muscle with self-contained sensing,2016,"Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are one of the most famous linear actuators in bio-inspired robotics. They can generate relatively high linear force considering their form factors and weights. Furthermore, PAMs are inexpensive compared with traditional electromagnetic actuators (e.g. DC motors) and also inherently light and compliant. In robotics applications, however, they typically require external sensing mechanisms due to their nonlinear behaviors, which may make the entire mechanical system bulky and complicated, limiting their use in simple systems. This study presents the design and fabrication of a low-cost McKibben-type PAM with a self-contained displacement and force sensing capability that does not require any external sensing elements. The proposed PAM can detect axial contraction force and displacement at the same time. In this study, the design of a traditional McKibben muscle was modified to include an inductive coil surrounding the muscle fibers. Then, a thin, soft silicone layer was coated outside of the muscle to protect and hold the sensing coil on the actuator. This novel design measures coil inductance change to determine the contraction force and the displacement. The process can be applied to a variety of existing McKibben actuator designs without significantly changing the rigidity of the actuator while minimizing the device's footprint."
2898096,22736,208,A swarm-based fuzzy logic control mobile sensor network for hazardous contaminants localization,2004,"We describe a swarm-based fuzzy logic control (FLC) mobile sensor network approach for collaboratively locating the hazardous contaminants in an unknown large-scale area. The mobile sensor network is composed of a collection of distributed nodes (robots), each of which has limited sensing, intelligence and communication capabilities. An ad-hoc wireless network is established among all nodes, and each node considers other nodes as extended sensors. By gathering other nodes' locations and measurement data, each node's FLC can independently determine its next optimal deployment location. Simultaneously, by applying the three properties of the swarm behavior: separation, cohesion and alignment, the approach can ensure the sensor network attains wide regional coverage and dynamically stable connectivity. The simulation presented in this paper shows the swarm-based FLC mobile sensor network can achieve better performance and have higher fault tolerance in the event of partial node failures and sensor measurement errors."
2081602,22736,9704,Optimal Trajectory Generation for a Humanoid Robot Based on Fuzzy and Genetic Algorithm,2006,"This paper is concerned with the generation of gait trajectory for a humanoid robot based on genetic algorithm (GA). A humanoid robot has some problems of the structural instability basically, which leads to consider the complex control of multiple joints caused by nonlinearities. In addition, the walking trajectory of a humanoid robot should be considered to its smoothness and be reduced the torque to save the electric power, because a mobile robot has battery to move autonomously on its body. If movements of walking joint don’t maintain optimally, it is difficult for a robot to have efficient working time. Also, if a gait trajectory doesn’t have optimal state, the expected life span of joints is decreased. To solve these problems, optimal gait trajectory by using artificial intelligence like GA can be introduced. In this paper, a GA is considered for searching the optimal via points as well as optimal control gains. All the processes are investigated and verified through simulations with the parameters of real humanoid system."
2138029,22736,65,Sharing effort in planning human-robot handover tasks,2012,"For a versatile human-assisting mobile-manipulating robot such as the PR2, handing over objects to humans in possibly cluttered workspaces is a key capability. In this paper we investigate the motion planning of handovers while accounting for the human mobility. We treat the human motion as part of the planning problem thus enabling to find broader type of handing strategies. We formalize the problem and propose an algorithmic solution taking into account the HRI constraints induced by the human receiver presence. Simulation results with the PR2 robot illustrate the efficacy of the approach."
1909280,22736,11321,Reinforcement learning by reward-weighted regression for operational space control,2007,"Many robot control problems of practical importance, including operational space control, can be reformulated as immediate reward reinforcement learning problems. However, few of the known optimization or reinforcement learning algorithms can be used in online learning control for robots, as they are either prohibitively slow, do not scale to interesting domains of complex robots, or require trying out policies generated by random search, which are infeasible for a physical system. Using a generalization of the EM-base reinforcement learning framework suggested by Dayan & Hinton, we reduce the problem of learning with immediate rewards to a reward-weighted regression problem with an adaptive, integrated reward transformation for faster convergence. The resulting algorithm is efficient, learns smoothly without dangerous jumps in solution space, and works well in applications of complex high degree-of-freedom robots."
750011,22736,9475,High-speed motion with limited sensing range in a poisson forest,2012,"Inspired by birds flying in dense forests, we consider the problem of motion planning with limited sensing range in a planar forest environment, where the locations of the disc-shaped trees are generated by a homogeneous Poisson process. First, we show that, under some minimal technical assumptions on the dynamics of the robot, the existence of infinite collision-free trajectories exhibits a phase transition with increasing intensity of the Poisson obstacle generation process. We show that the critical threshold is non-trivial, i.e., a finite non-zero number. Second, we propose a novel planning algorithm, based on state lattices, that can navigate the robot with limited sensing range. We show that the probability that the planner fails to traverse an large environment converges to zero exponentially fast with increasing sensing range."
2857922,22736,9577,Probabilistic Human Mobility Model in Indoor Environment,2016,"Understanding human mobility is important for the development of intelligent mobile service robots as it can provide prior knowledge and predictions of human distribution for robot-assisted activities. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic method to model human motion behaviors which is determined by both internal and external factors in an indoor environment. While the internal factors are represented by the individual preferences, aims and interests, the external factors are indicated by the stimulation of the environment. We model the randomness of human macro-level movement, e.g., the probability of visiting a specific place and staying time, under the Bayesian framework, considering the influence of both internal and external variables. We use two case studies in a shopping mall and in a college student dorm building to show the effectiveness of our proposed probabilistic human mobility model. Real surveillance camera data are used to validate the proposed model together with survey data in the case study of student dorm."

These mechanisms include an architectural schema that encourages parallel and incremental information processing, and a method for binding information from distinct representations that when faced with rapid change in the world can maintain a coherent, though distributed, view of it. Provisional results are demonstrated in a robot combining vision, manipulation, language, planning and reasoning capabilities interacting with a human and manipulable objects."
1114928,22736,8441,A robust probing motion planning scheme: A tube-based MPC approach,2013,"This paper discusses the efficacy of a robust probing motion planning scheme. The proposed solution relies on i) tube-based MPC from the set-theoretic framework to ensure the robustness, and ii) the partially-closed loop strategy from stochastic MPC to incorporate the future measurement and increase the cautiousness of the control systems. More precisely, the proposed solution is composed of two controllers: one nominal MPC controller that guarantees the trajectory to be globally convergent and probing, and one ancillary MPC controller that stabilizes the robot around the nominal optimal trajectory. The feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithm have been demonstrated through extensive numerical simulation for a two-wheeled mobile robot."
1808494,22736,9616,Real-time obstacle avoidance using an MPEG-processor-based optic flow sensor,2000,"Describes a vision system for obstacle detection in mobile robot navigation. The system uses an image processing board equipped with an MPEG motion estimation processor that calculates a robust optic-flow-like vector field in real-time. This field is then evaluated by algorithms running in software on the host PC. As the solutions to the general problem of structure and motion from optic flow are too instable for the use in this application, the typical constraints of mobile robotics are exploited, i.e. a reduced set of motion parameters and a known ground plane. Ego-motion can then be reconstructed with robust one dimensional methods. A new criterion for obstacles that copes well with the noise properties of the motion field is introduced. For vectors belonging to obstacles the 3D information is reconstructed allowing not only qualitative detection of obstacles but quantitative path planning."
1876012,22736,20515,On using gait biometrics to enhance face pose estimation,2010,"Many face biometrics systems use controlled environments where subjects are viewed directly facing the camera. This is less likely to occur in surveillance environments, so a process is required to handle the pose variation of the human head, change in illumination, and low frame rate of input image sequences. This has been achieved using scale invariant features and 3D models to determine the pose of the human subject. Then, a gait trajectory model is generated to obtain the correct the face region whilst handing the looming effect. In this way, we describe a new approach aimed to estimate accurate face pose. The contributions of this research include the construction of a 3D model for pose estimation from planar imagery and the first use of gait information to enhance the face pose estimation process."
1880807,22736,21106,A theory of catadioptric image formation,1998,"Conventional video cameras have limited fields of view which make them restrictive for certain applications in computational vision. A catadioptric sensor uses a combination of lenses and mirrors placed in a carefully arranged configuration to capture a much wider field of view. When designing a catadioptric sensor, the shape of the mirror(s) should ideally be selected to ensure that the complete catadioptric system has a single effective viewpoint. In this paper, we derive the complete class of single-lens single-mirror catadioptric sensors which have a single viewpoint and an expression for the spatial resolution of a catadioptric sensor in terms of the resolution of the camera used to construct it. We also include a preliminary analysis of the defocus blur caused by the use of a curved mirror."
2508651,22736,20561,World embedded interfaces for human-robot interaction,2003,"Human interaction with large numbers of robots or distributed sensors presents a number of difficult challenges including supervisory management, monitoring of individual and collective state, and apprehending situation awareness. A rich source of information about the environment can be provided even with robots that have no explicit representations or maps of their locale. To do this, we transform a robot swarm into a distributed interface embedded within the environment. Visually, each robot acts like a pixel within a much larger visual display space so that any robot need only communicate a small amount of information from its current location. Our approach uses augmented reality techniques for communicating information to humans from large numbers of small-scale robots to enable situation awareness, monitoring, and control for surveillance, reconnaissance, hazard detection, and path finding."
2988325,22736,9704,Robot-to-human handover with obstacle avoidance via continuous time Recurrent Neural Network,2016,"Parallel with the development of service robots, it is vital for the robots to carry out handovers autonomously. Robot-to-human handover is a coordination in time and space for a robot to deliver an object to human. A good robot-to-human handover should consider human safety and preference, natural motion planning that mimics human and adaptability to the changes of the environment. Conventional handover motion mostly rely on sampling-based algorithms that emphasizes on kinematic and dynamic analysis. This kind of motion planning could become complicated and slow in response if the handover motion is implemented in a dynamic environment where real time motion planning is required. To simplify the implementation of robot-to-human handover, a motion learning and generation framework that based on Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network(CTRNN) is proposed. The proposed framework is equipped with the capabilities of object recognition, motion generation based on past learning experience and obstacle adaptation. As compared with conventional method, the proposed framework could be easily extended to handover motion with high dimensional configuration spaces as the motion can be generated from the learnt experience. In the proposed framework, the handover behaviour can be learnt via human-guided motion teaching which provides an intuitive and visible solution for motion planning. The proposed framework has been experimentally evaluated on a customized design robot via robotto-human handover testing. Based on the testing, the feasibility of the proposed framework had been justified."

In this paper, we propose to extend the classical PbD approach with a graphical language that makes robot coaching easier. The main idea is based on graphical programming where the user designs complex robot tasks by using a set of low-level action primitives. Different to other systems, our action primitives are made general and flexible so that the user can train them online and therefore easily design high level tasks."

To avoid recognizing the same text many times, it is necessary to decrease the number of text candidate regions for recognition. This paper presents a text capturing robot that can look around the environment using an active camera. The text candidate regions are extracted from the images using an improved DCT feature. The text regions are tracked in the video sequence so that the number of text images to be recognized is reduced. In the experiment, we tested 460 images of a corridor with fifteen signboards including text. The number of text candidate regions is reduced by 90.1% using our text tracking method."

Compared with existing methods, our approach is naturally parallelizable and allows for incorporating different cost functionals with only minor adjustments. We apply our method to classical challenging instances and observe that its computational requirements scale well with p for several cost functionals. We also show that a specialization of our algorithm can be used for local motion planning by solving the problem of joint optimization in velocity space."
885431,22736,65,Learning grasp stability based on tactile data and HMMs,2010,"In this paper, the problem of learning grasp stability in robotic object grasping based on tactile measurements is studied. Although grasp stability modeling and estimation has been studied for a long time, there are few robots today able of demonstrating extensive grasping skills. The main contribution of the work presented here is an investigation of probabilistic modeling for inferring grasp stability based on learning from examples. The main objective is classification of a grasp as stable or unstable before applying further actions on it, e.g. lifting. The problem cannot be solved by visual sensing which is typically used to execute an initial robot hand positioning with respect to the object. The output of the classification system can trigger a regrasping step if an unstable grasp is identified. An off-line learning process is implemented and used for reasoning about grasp stability for a three-fingered robotic hand using Hidden Markov models. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments are performed both in simulation and on a real robot system."
972752,22736,65,Exploiting human cooperation in human-centered robot navigation,2010,"Robot path planning has traditionally concentrated on collision-free paths. For robots that collaborate closely with humans, however, the situation is different in two respects: 1) the humans in the robot's environment are not randomly moving objects, but cognitive beings who can deliberately make way for a robot to pass and 2) the quality of a navigation plan depends less on quantitative efficiency criteria, but rather on the acceptance of humans. In this paper, we introduce a robot navigation approach that takes into account human-centered requirements and the collaborative nature of the interaction between the human and the robot."
703551,22736,9078,Robust Ground Plane Detection with Normalized Homography in Monocular Sequences from a Robot Platform,2006,"We present a homography-based approach to detect the ground plane from monocular sequences captured by a robot platform. By assuming that the camera is fixed on the robot platform and can at most rotate horizontally, we derive the constraints that the homograph of the ground plane must satisfy and then use these constraints to design algorithms for detecting the ground plane. Due to the reduced degree of freedom, the resultant algorithm is not only more efficient and robust, but also able to avoid false detection due to virtual planes. We present experiments with real data from a robot platform to validate the proposed approaches."
637307,22736,22130,Discovery of Activity Structures using the Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model.,2005,"In building a surveillance system for monitoring people behaviours, it is important to understand the typical patterns of people's movement in the environment. This task is difficult when dealing with high-level behaviours. The flat model such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) is inefficient in differentiating between signatures of such behaviours. This paper examines structure learning for high-level behaviours using the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM).We propose a two-phase learning algorithm in which the parameters of the behaviours at low levels are estimated first and then the structures and parameters of the behaviours at high levels are learned from multi-camera training data. Our algorithm is then evaluated using data from a real environment, demonstrating the robustness of the learned structure in recognising people's behaviour."
896888,22736,9475,A compact exploration strategy for indoor flight vehicles,2011,This paper presents a compact exploration strategy designed to be implemented onboard indoor Miniature Air Vehicles (MAVs) operating in cluttered and confined environments. The exploration strategy uses 2D range information from a laser range scanner to generate velocity commands by blending a Sensor-based Random Tree frontier planner with a wall-following velocity field generator. The combined approach leverages the efficient exploration capabilities of frontier-based guidance and ensures that the vehicles follows a path that is free of obstacles and conducive to maintaining good scan geometry through a wall-following approach. The strategy has been successfully implemented and tested on a Quadrotor MAV and simulation results are presented. Flight test results shall be included in the final version.
917275,22736,9475,Planning stable trajectory on uneven terrain based on Feasible Acceleration Count,2011,"In this paper we propose a novel physics based motion planning and trajectory generation framework for vehicle operating on uneven terrains. The proposed framework provides for a fully 3D analysis of the dynamic constraints of the vehicle on uneven terrain and hence comes as a better approach than the existing motion planning framework which makes simplifying assumptions for the terrain conditions or the vehicle geometry or both. The entire framework consists of three major parts which are: 1. A framework for determination of the posture of a vehicle in 3D for a given terrain. 2. A framework for determination of maximum feasible velocities and acceleration based on contact and no-slip constraints. 3. Combining the above two framework to generate feasible trajectories for the vehicle. Trajectories are generated through a Dynamic Window paradigm extended to fully 3D terrains, wherein the next best node is selected through a new metric that maximizes the space of feasible velocities and accelerations and reduces the distance to be traversed to the goal"

Since visual sensing is usually performed with limited resources, visual sensing strategies should be planned so that only necessary information is obtained efficiently. This paper describes a method of systematically generating visual sensing strategies based on knowledge of the task to be performed. The generation of the appropriate visual sensing strategy entails knowing what information to extract, where to get it, and how to get it. This is facilitated by the knowledge of the task, which describes what objects are involved in the operation, and how they are assembled. Our method has been implemented using a laser range finder as the sensor. Experimental results show the feasibility of the method, and point out the importance of task-oriented evaluation of visual sensing strategies. >"
344015,22736,11052,Geometric Properties of Central Catadioptric Line Images,2002,It is highly desirable that an imaging system has a single effective viewpoint. Central catadioptric systems are imaging systems that use mirrors to enhance the field of view while keeping a unique center of projection. A general model for central catadioptric image formation has already been established. The present paper exploits this model to study the catadioptric projection of lines. The equations and geometric properties of general catadioptric line imaging are derived. We show that it is possible to determine the position of both the effective viewpoint and the absolute conic in the catadioptric image plane from the images of three lines. It is also proved that it is possible to identify the type of catadioptric system and the position of the line at infinity without further information.

3038636,22736,23735,Acquisition of obstacle motion patterns to improve mobile robot motion planning,1999,"Mobile robots for advanced applications have to act in environments which contain moving obstacles (humans). Even though the motions of such obstacles are not precisely predictable, usually they are not completely random; long-term observation of obstacle behavior may thus yield valuable knowledge about prevailing motion patterns. By incorporating such knowledge as statistical data, a new approach called statistical motion planning yields robot motions which are better adapted to the dynamic environment. To put these ideas into practice, an experimental system has been developed. Cameras observe the workspace in order to detect obstacle motion. Statistical data is derived and represented as a set of stochastic trajectories, This data can be directly employed in order to calculate collision probability, i.e. the probability of encountering an obstacle during the robot's motion. Further aspects of motion planning are addressed: path planning which minimizes collision probability, estimation of expected time to reach the goal and reactive planning."
1195583,22736,65,Incremental on-line hierarchical clustering of whole body motion patterns,2007,"This paper describes a novel algorithm for autonomous and incremental learning of motion pattern primitives by observation of human motion. Human motion patterns are abstracted into a hidden Markov model representation, which can be used for both subsequent motion recognition and generation, analogous to the mirror neuron hypothesis in primates. As new motion patterns are observed, they are incrementally grouped together using hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on their relative distance in the HMM space. The clustering algorithm forms a tree structure, with specialized motions at the tree leaves, and generalized motions closer to the root. The generated tree structure will depend on the type of training data provided, so that the most specialized motions will be those for which the most training has been received. Tests with motion capture data for a variety of motion primitives demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm."

Firstly, by analyzing the locomotion modes and the basic gaits of the robot, some arithmetic operators to describe the change of the position and orientation are defined, and a gait graph model is also presented. Secondly, making reference to the main idea of the partial dynamic window method, the path planning method is proposed, which include the environment modeling based on the dynamic partial grid map and the feasible gait searching algorithm based on the complete or incomplete traversal. Finally, some simulations and experiments are provided to validate the rationality and the validity of the path planning method."

The peripheral and central vision are the basic capabilities of foveated vision. The informations obtained from the peripheral vision are used to determine the next gaze point. Due to the low resolution of the periphery, however, the determination is not always appropriate. To solve this problem, we propose to evaluate the target object by the central vision after gazing. We implement foveated vision based on the Log Polar Mapping (LPM) and construct an evaluation scheme of the target object in the central vision using LPM rotational-invariance. The peripheral vision is realized by Zero Disparity Filter for LPM stereo images. Some experimental results are also shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

882012,22736,23735,"Cogeneration of Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Designs for Printable Robots from Structural Specifications",2014,"Designing and fabricating new robotic systems is typically limited to experts, requiring engineering background, expensive tools, and considerable time. In contrast, to facilitate everyday users developing custom robots for personal use, this work presents a new system to easily create printable foldable robots from high-level structural specifications. A user merely needs to select electromechanical components from a library of basic building blocks and pre-designed mechanisms, then connect them to define custom robot assemblies. The system then generates complete mechanical drawings suitable for fabrication, instructions for the assembly of electronics, and software to control and drive the final robot. Several robots designed in this manner demonstrate the ability and versatility of this process. I. INTRODUCTION While robots are widely used for research and commer- cial applications, they are not yet ubiquitous in everyday life for personalized tasks. Creating a new robotic system typically involves repeated design iterations using a variety of computer-aided design tools. Domain-specific expertise is generally required to create the requisite mechanical drawings for a structural body, electronic circuits to connect sensors and actuators, and software to manage system inputs and outputs. This entire process often needs to be rerun for each new robot desired, making the design and fabrication of new robots slow and introducing a knowledge barrier for casual users. For the general public to obtain a device able to accom- plish a specified function, computational tools are required that can create robots from high-level descriptions. The long- term objective is to develop a hardware compiler that can start with functional specifications of a desired system and automatically design and fabricate a robot to accomplish those. This paper takes a step towards that vision with a system to simultaneously generate the mechanical, electrical, and software components of a robot from its structural specifications, allowing non-experts to easily design elec- tromechanical systems with custom specifications and then quickly and inexpensively fabricate the designed robot. The presented approach modularizes mechanical, electri- cal, and software components to represent them in a database suitable for hierarchical composition. These parameterized components are characterized in terms of their geometric and physical properties; while experts can directly generate new low level building blocks, casual users can simply connect existing designs to make custom electromechanical devices. The system then automatically outputs a collection of files with which the user can manufacture the specified robot: fabrication drawings get sent to a desktop cutter to generate cut-and-fold origami-inspired 3D structures, wiring instructions guide the user to assemble sensors and actuators onto that structure using plug-and-play electronic modules, and libraries and application software get loaded onto a central microcontroller. The resulting robot can be wirelessly controlled from an auto-generated user interface (UI) on a smartphone."
977413,22736,23735,The first flight of an insect-sized robotic fly,2007,"Insects of the order Diptera have evolved to become prolific flyers able to perform aerial maneuvers that far surpass anything man-made. The Harvard Micro robotics lab has recently demonstrated the first step towards recreating these evolutionary wonders with the world's first demonstration of an at-scale robotic insect capable of generating sufficient thrust to takeoff (with external power). The mechanics and aerodynamics of this device are quite similar to Dipteran insects. Biologists have recently quantified the complex nonlinear temporal phenomena that give insects their outstanding capabilities. Periodic wing motions consisting of a large stroke and pronation and supination about an axis parallel to the span-wise direction are characteristic of most hovering Dipteran insects. Previous microrobot designs have attempted to concisely control each wing trajectory in these two dimensions. The robot that is shown here has three degrees-of- freedom, only one of which is actuated. Here, a central power actuator drives the wing with as large a stroke as possible and passive dynamics allow the wing to rotate using flexural elements with joint stops to avoid over-rotation. There are four primary components to the mechanical system: the actuator (or 'flight muscle'), transmission (or 'thorax'), airframe (or 'exoskeleton') and the wings. Each is constructed using a meso- scale manufacturing paradigm called Smart Composite Microstructures. This entails the use of laminated laser-micromachined materials stacked to achieve a desired compliance profile. This prototyping method is inexpensive, conceptually simple, and fast: for example, all components of the fly can be created in less than one week. Additionally, the resulting structures perform favorably when compared to alternative devices: flexure joints have almost no loss, ultra-high modulus links have higher stiffness-to-weight than any other material, and the piezoelectric actuators have similar power density to the best DC motors at any scale. After integration, the fly is fixed to guide wires that restrict the motion so that the fly can only move vertically. The wings are then driven open loop to achieve a large angular displacement. This is done at resonance to further amplify the wing motion. The wings exhibit a trajectory nearly identical to biological counterparts. Finally, this 60 mg, 3 cm wingspan system is allowed to freely move in the vertical direction demonstrating thrust that accelerates the fly upwards. Bench-top thrust measurements show that this robotic fly has a thrust-to- weight ratio of approximately two. These results unequivocally confirm the feasibility of insect-sized MAVs. The remaining challenges involve the development of microelectronics appropriate for power conversion, sensing, communication, and control along with the choice of an appropriate power source."
1591556,22736,23735,Passive dynamic walking of compass-like biped robot with dynamic absorbers,2014,"This paper investigates the roles and effects of dynamic absorbers attached to the leg frames on the gait properties of passive dynamic walking. First, we model a passive compass-like biped robot that consists of two identical leg frames with passive dynamic absorbers that represent micromechanical vibration or human flesh dynamics. We then conduct gait analysis through numerical simulations to observe how small oscillation of the leg frames affects the gait prop- erties, and show that speeding-up is achieved by utilizing the indirect softness produced by the dynamic absorbers. Second, we investigate the dominant effect of small oscillation using the same model. The simulation results show high nonlinearity in the generated walking gait. I. INTRODUCTION Limit cycle walkers generate energy-efficient walking gaits by using the inherent natural dynamics (1). Recently, the studies on legged robots focusing on the leg stiffness have been conducted in the area of limit cycle walking. Kawamoto and Asano clarified that adaptability to uneven terrain can be improved by using leg viscoelasticity through numerical simulation and experiments (2). They also showed that viscoelastic-legged walkers have advantages to overcome steps and continue stable walking on various road conditions without changing the walking speed so much. They also showed that rigid-legged walkers have an advantage to gener- ate faster walking gaits than viscoelastic-legged ones but are less adaptive to uneven terrain. The leg viscoelasticity tends to create non-instantaneous double-limb support motion and this significantly decreases the walking speed. The center of mass (CoM) trajectory, however, becomes smoother and this would make the walker overcome the potential barrier at mid-stance easily. Similar results are also reported in (3). The above facts imply that soft leg-frames are important for improving the adaptability and maneuverability of the generated gait in return for high-speed movement. We hu- mans have both advantages of the leg stiffness and softness, and can easily generate high-speed and highly adaptive walking gaits. We should reconsider how the robot leg- frames should be designed to reproduce the high performance of human walking. The basis of the leg frames should be made of a solid material to achieve high-speed walking motion, while soft- ness should be added indirectly so that the period of non- instantaneous double-limb support motion becomes short. The importance of robot's internal softness reproduced as an wobbling motion has also been reported by Hanazawa et al. (4) and Ackerman et al. (5). The authors also found the validity of a 2-DOF wobbling mass in a passive rimless wheel (6). In these early works, however, the indirect softness was given as an additional linkage to the robot's body frame. Based on the observations, in this paper we propose a novel limit-cycle walker that have dynamic absorbers on the leg frames. We add dynamic absorbers parallel to the rigid leg frames for the purpose of indirectly reproducing the dynamical effect of viscoelastic legs while keeping high- stiffness of the legs. It is then expected that efficient passive or underactuated walking gaits can be generated without decreasing the walking speed. We introduce the model of a compass-like biped robot (7) that added dynamic absorbers parallel to the leg frames and numerically analyze the gait properties according to the change in the viscoelastic coefficients. We show that speeding-up of passive compass gait can be achieved by the effect of the dynamic absorbers during motion. We discuss the speeding-up mechanism mainly from the viewpoint of flattening of the CoM trajectory. In addition, we also show that some strange gaits are generated where the dynamic absorber motion is more dominant."
264423,22736,23735,Human friendly robotics - A challenge to new robot applications,1999,"Summary form only given, as follows. At the beginning of the 21 st century, an increase of the population of the elderly people is expected. For example, the statistics tell us that in Japan the population of the elderly people who are older than 65 years will reach to 25% of the total population in 2010. Such a society is supposed to cause several problems in our daily life. One of the most serious problems will be relating to the difficulty of supplying enough labor power in several areas. The other is to increase people who need some kinds of help in their daily life because of the increase of the aged people population who needs health care. One of ways to solve these problems will be to develop some kinds of machines like robots which can work in lieu of human and also provide some services to human. The human friendly robotic research has started to pursue such kinds of robots. There are so many robots used in manufacturing industry and so on. Those robots were for releasing people fkom hazardous, dirty and tedious works and were the machines which work in non human existing environment. Therefore, the robot can be a dangerous machine to human and is used with keeping strict regulations for human safety. Human friendly robot will be defined as the robot which can work together with quite ordinary people in the same environment safely, friendly and efficiently. To develop such a robot, there are many problems which have to be solved, like how the robot structure should be designed to guarantee human safety, how the human-robot interface should be designed and so on. This talk will introduce several current research activities in human friendly robotics researches. There are many robot applications we can consider in human environment. In the talk, two types of human friendly robots will be pointed out. The first is the robot which can help some physical tasks. The second is the robot which can provide some emotional impression through its behavior which makes human delight. Health care and welfare, power assist for several tasks and medical robots will be typical important applications of the first type. The second type will be something like pet robots and so on. This talk will address several examples of the developed products concerning those applications and mention what is the technology to be needed to produce more advanced products. Finally, the current statw of humanoid robotics technology will be addressed. Humanoid robotics researches have been popular since the beginning of 1990s. From the observation of the recent technology advancement, some technology in this area seems to be mature to use it practically in the near future. Humanoid robotics research itself includes both aspects of fundamental and application researches. From the application point of view, the humanoid robot will be a candidate of efficient human fiiendly robot, because the shape makes us imagine the human friendliness. With this in mind, the possibility of the humanoid robot as a type of human friendly robot will be discussed. Also, the Japanese national project Humanoid Robotics Project will be introduced."
586217,22736,23735,A Discrete Event Controller Using Petri Nets Applied To Assembly,1992,"paper takes a new approach to robotic assembly, treating assembly as a discrete event system. A discrete event in assembly is defined as a change in contact state reflecting a change in a ge- ometric constraint. The discrete event modelling is ac~complished using Petri nets. The problems of task-level planning .and syn- thesis are addressed. Using the Petri net modelling, a discrete event controller (DEC) is developed. The DEC is a task-level controller that directs the assembly process to the desired end state. The DEC outputs both a desired velocity and it desired force command. The desired velocity commands insure consis- tency with geometric constraints while simultaneouslly directing the system toward the next desired discrete state. The desired force commands attempt to maintain the current state of contact. Task-level planning is accomplished using dynamic programming to deterimine the optimal sequence of discrete states for success- ful assembly. This desired sequence of discrete states is then used as a reference input to the DEC. 1 Iintroduction In discrete automation, assembly is one of the most error-prone, unreliablle processes. There is an increasing need for efficient methods of increased robustness and reliability in :the face of tolerancing errors and uncertainties in the workpieces and the environment. The control of assembly, including task level tra- jectories and on-line task level control, is a key component to improving the success of robotic assembly. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach to the control of robotic assembly tasks, treating assembly as a discrete event dynamic system. The abstraction to discrete event modelling highlights the necessary transitions for successful assembly. Additionally, the abstraction allows for planning on a task level rather than the cumbersome process of exact trajectory planning. Various methods have been proposed for the control of assem- bly processes. (Whitney, 19821 derives quasi-static con.dit,ions for a successful insertion operations. (Mason, 19821 (Raibert and Craig, 19811 describe a hybrid position/force control for various tasks. Other work has included using force feedback as a source of task preformance information (Hannaford, 19871. However, unlike most force-feedback applications, the state of contact changes during an assembly process. These discrete changes in state should be the focal point of the control procedure In order t,o incorporate the state changes, we will model assembly as a discrete event dynamic system. The discrete state vector will be the discrete states of contact in the assembhly process. The discrete events (occurring at discrete instances in time) are the since they indicate significant changes in the system dynamics. changes in contact state. Typically, discrete event dynamic sys- tem models arise from certain aspects of manufacturing systems and data network protocols. In contrast to these applications, this paper presents the discrete event modelling and control of robotic assembly. The difficulty of modelling and designing discrete event control systems has long been recognized in the literature. Moreover, there is apparently no unifying theory for the control of discrete event systems. Numerous methods have been proposed for the modelling and analysis of discrete event systems, each having different characteristics. Some of these include formal languages (Ramadge, 19891, finite state machines (Tadmor and Maimon, 19891, and Petri nets (Peterson, 19811. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach to robotic assembly, treating assembly as a discrete event dynamic system. The discrete event modelling is accomplished using Petri nets. The abstraction of assembly to Petri net modelling highlights the key transitions necessary for successful insertion. Additionally, the abstraction allows for planning on a task level rather than the cumbersome process of exact trajectory planning. Using the Petri net modelling, a discrete event controller (DEC) is developed. The DEC is a task-level controller that directs the assembly process to the desired end state. Two condi- tions are derived that perform this function. First, a closed form solution is given for the desired velocity commands. Desired ve- locity commands insure consistency with geometric constraints while simultaneously directing the system toward the next de- sired discrete state. Second, an equation is derived the specifies the desired force commands, The desired force commands are the forces that attempt to maintain the current state of contact. Lastly, an optimal sequence of discrete events (changes of con- tact) leading to successful insertion is determined using dynamic programming, thus completing the specificaiions for the DEC."
1366688,22736,23735,Single Muscle Site sEMG Interface for Assistive Grasping,2014,"We present a joint demonstration between the Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory (RASCAL) at UC Davis and the Columbia University Robotics Group, wherein a human-in-the-loop robotic grasping platform in the Columbia lab (New York, NY) is controlled to select and grasp an object by a C3-C4 spinal cord injury (SCI) subject in the UC Davis lab (Davis, CA) using a new single-signal, multi- degree-of-freedom surface electromyography (sEMG) human- robot interface. The grasping system breaks the grasping task into a multi-stage pipeline that can be navigated with only a few inputs. It integrates pre-planned grasps with on-line grasp planning capability and an object recognition and target selection system capable of handling multi-object scenes with moderate occlusion. Previous work performed in the RASCAL lab demonstrated that by continuously modulating the power in two individual bands in the frequency spectrum of a single sEMG signal, users were able to control a cursor in 2D for cursor to target tasks. Using this paradigm, four targets were presented in order for the subject to command the multi- stage grasping pipeline. We demonstrate that using this system, operators are able to grasp objects in a remote location using a robotic grasping platform. I. INTRODUCTION Grasping objects is critical to many activities of daily life that present challenges to people with upper limb mobility impairments. This work presents an assistive grasping system using a human-in-the-loop for a disabled user to grasp objects from a table using a novel, non-invasive sEMG based input device even in somewhat cluttered scenes. The novel device measures only a single differential sEMG signal at one muscle site on the user. The system puts the user in control of a multi-stage grasping pipeline that includes object recogni- tion, integrated pre-planned and on-line grasp planning with feedback to help the user plan robust grasps in near real time. We show that an impaired user can successfully use this system to grasp objects using a real robotic grasping platform. The key contributions of this work include: a) In- tegration with a novel sEMG input device which relies on only a single muscle site. b) A new UI that improves the disabled user's ability to understand the scene and produce correct grasps in complex, cluttered environments. c) Online reachability analysis and feedback. d) Online assessment of the desired approach direction. e) Evaluation of this system on an impaired user in a remote location. f) A demonstration that this new UI is descriptive enough for the user to operate in an environment that they have never seen."
2529262,22736,23735,A New Control Scheme For Bilateral Teleoperating Systems: Performance Evaluation And Comparison,1992,"This paper evaluates the performance of a new control scheme for bilateral master-slave teleo- perator, introduced earlier, and compares it to pub- lished control methods by using a mathematical cri- terion based on the two-port network model. It is shown that most of the published control laws under investigation do not achieve optimal performance, and the few that do, require perfect estimation (or exact knowledge) of the human operator or master arm dynamics. It is also shown that optimal performance, based on the selected mathematical criterion, can be obtained using the proposed control law: I. INTRODUCTION Teleoperating systems may be viewed as synergistic systems composed of human operators and master-slave manipulators which interact with the physical world. The master, sometimes called hand controller, is used to gen- erate commands (usually position, rate or force commands) to its remotedly located counterpart called slave. In gen- eral, the position/velocity command from the operator is fed forward to the slave, while the reaction force, due to mechanical interaction with the environment, is fed back to the master, providing contact force information to the human operator. By reflecting the measured force back to the master arm, it is said that the teleoperator is controlled bilaterally. One of the main issues in telerobotics is control of master-slave teleoperators. A number of control metho- dologies have been proposed in the teleoperator literature. There are two main methods for controlling master-slave teleoperators. The first, a more traditional approach, uses position and/or velocity error (between the master and slave) to generate a forcehorque command into the master arm. The position/velocity of the master and slave are measured by sensors usually located at the joints. The second method uses direct force feedback, rather than posi- tion and velocity errors, to generate command signals to the master. This method uses a force/torque signal obtained from a sensor, usually located at the end-effector of the slave, to provide the operator with the force feeling of the remotedly located counterpart. The force feedback control is usually considered superior because of the more precise nature of the feedback signal. The two-port model network theory has been exten- sively used for the analysis of circuits in which bi- directional energy flows are present at two distinct pairs of terminals. This method provides a useful linear representa- tion of complex networks which exchange energy. The two-port model theory is also used in bilateral teleoperator systems (1,3-81, with force and velocity sensing at the mas- ter and slave. The interfaces between the human operator and master, and between the environment and slave are ports through which the teleoperator is designed to exchange energy between the operator and environment. Recently, several algorithms have been proposed to"

This paper presents a new telepresence robot with gesture-based attention direction to orient the robot towards attention targets according to human deictic gestures. Gesture-based attention direction is realized by combining Localist Attractor Network (LAN) and Short-Term Memory (STM). We also propose audio- visual fusion based on context-dependent prioritization among the 3 types of audio-visual cues (gesture, speech source location, head location). Experiment results are very promising and show that i) the average gesture recognition rate is 92%, i) gesture- based attention direction rate is 90%, and that ii) only by considering the 3 types of audio-visual cues together can the robot perform on par with a human in directing attention to the correct person in a meeting scenario. I. INTRODUCTION Telepresence technology, which enables people to com- municate face-to-face over remote distances, is gaining im- portance and popularity as a useful tool at home and in the workplace for increasing productivity and connecting people. The application of robotics-related technologies to telepresence can enhance user interaction experience by pro- viding embodiment, engaging behaviors, automatic control, and human perception. To this end, research-oriented telepresence robot platforms have been developed to study human-robot interaction. The MeBot (1) is a small mobile articulated telerobot that allows the operator to express non-verbal cues such as hand and head gestures. The Texai robot is a mobile platform with a screen at standing-height, and can be controlled to move around a remote office to attend meetings. Powered by HARK, an advanced audition software with sound source localization, tracking and separation capabilities, a sophis- ticated dialogue management and auditory awareness has been demonstrated on the Texai robot (2). To increase robustness of speaker tracking, audiovisual approaches have also been proposed. Omnidirectional vision combined with sound localization has been shown to track speakers as they are move around the robot (3). Computational AudioVisual Scene Analysis (CAVSA) based on proto-objects and short term memory (4) has been designed to track speakers even if they disappear for a while. Our previous work studied audio-visual attention control based on speech source lo- calization and visual face tracking for a telepresence robot, and presented a user study showing facilitation of show-and- tell and increased presence (5). Audio-visual integration has"
1311036,22736,23735,Demonstration of an ITER relevant remote handling equipment for Tokamak close inspection,2008,"This work concerns the development of an ITER relevant advanced robotic systems for fusion reactor. The feasibility demonstration will be performed on the thermonuclear experimental Tokamak: Tore Supra, located in Cadarache facilities. The manipulator developed by the interactive robotics unit of CEA-LIST will be used for close inspection intervention tasks in a Tokamak. The robot must meet severe specifications: small diameter, long reach with a 9.5 m cantilever length, high dexterity to move in a Torus shape environment and able to carry a 10 kg payload on its end effector. As the robot must be introduced without breaking the machine conditioning, it has to cope with the vacuum and temperature constraints: Ultra High Vacuum (10 -6  Pa) and 120degC in use, 200degC during baking phase. This long reach multi-link carrier has 10 DOF (9 rotary joints and 1 prismatic joint). It is composed of 5 modules and a precise guiding and pushing system (the deployer) for a total weight of about 300 kg. The gravity effect in the manipulator is largely compensated by a special mechanical structure (the parallelogram) that helps reducing the size of the actuators. The severe operating conditions impose a selection of several vacuum and temperature technologies that have been tested, qualified or optimized to cope with the requirements.In September 2007, the Remote Handling Equipment deployment under atmospheric conditions in a real Tokamak environment (Tore Supra) enabled to qualify the entire prototype. The scenario has to be rehearsed under vacuum and temperature to achieve the complete feasibility demonstration of a Tokamak close inspection by means of a robotic equipment under real operating conditions. The demonstration is an important step in the project but further developments are or could be necessary to cope with 100% of the requirements toward a reliable industrial prototype. In particular, due to its size and weight, this large robot manipulator holds lots of elastic and geometric deformations. Thus its accuracy is a challenge. A mechanical model could be developed to take into consideration the flexibilities of the structure and by means of calibration, the model parameters could be identified and then integrated in a real time controller. Further advanced developments on the on line monitoring system are also necessary for operator assistance and fault detection."
767415,22736,23735,Ear-based Exploration on Hybrid Metric/Topological Maps,2014,"In this paper we propose a hierarchy of techniques for performing loop closure in indoor environments together with an exploration strategy designed to reduce uncertainty in the resulting map. We use the generalized Voronoi graph to represent the indoor environment and an extended Kalman filter to track the pose of the robot and the position of the junctions (vertices) of the topological graph. Every time a vertex is revisited, the robot re-localizes and updates the uncertainty estimate accordingly. Finally, since the reduction of the map uncertainty remains one of the main concerns, the robot will optimize its schedule of revisiting junctions in the environment in order to reduce the accumulated uncertainty. Experimental results from a mobile robot equipped with a laser range-finder and results from realistic simulations that validate our approach are presented. I. INTRODUCTION This paper presents a solution to the problem of mapping an indoor environment by combining local sensor data into a hybrid topological/metric representation. The presented approach includes an exploration strategy, an environment representation, and a hierarchical approach to the loop clo- sure problem. More specifically, it is assumed that the envi- ronment is static and that the robot has no prior knowledge of its starting position or the space layout. The environment is completely GPS-denied and the only sensory information available to the robot are scans from a laser range-finder and odometry information; see Fig. 1. The proposed algorithm presents a robust way of mapping an unknown environment by performing loop closure in a systematic manner. The main building block of this work is the efficient on-line construction of the 2D generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) (1) based on local laser scans taken by the robot. Many different environments can be mapped adequately using a topological (graph) representation. The most com- mon ones are indoor areas with long corridors, such as those found in office buildings, but underground mines and cave systems are also good candidates. The main advantage of topological representations is that they encode path-planning guidance for the vehicle through a roadmap representation, without using high-dimensional representations of the envi- ronment. In other words, the robot can move through the environment by simply following a path in the roadmap graph. In addition, the nodes in the graph provide distinct places which can be used for localization. In this paper, the topological representation used is the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), a graph that encodes all the points in free"
2411684,22736,23735,Compliant quadruped locomotion over rough terrain,2009,"Many critical elements for statically stable walking for legged robots have been known for a long time, including stability criteria based on support polygons, good foothold selection, recovery strategies to name a few. All these criteria have to be accounted for in the planning as well as the control phase. Most legged robots usually employ high gain position control, which means that it is crucially important that the planned reference trajectories are a good match for the actual terrain, and that tracking is accurate. Such an approach leads to conservative controllers, i.e. relatively low speed, ground speed matching, etc. Not surprisingly such controllers are not very robust - they are not suited for the real world use outside of the laboratory where the knowledge of the world is limited and error prone. Thus, to achieve robust robotic locomotion in the archetypical domain of legged systems, namely complex rough terrain, where the size of the obstacles are in the order of leg length, additional elements are required. A possible solution to improve the robustness of legged locomotion is to maximize the compliance of the controller. While compliance is trivially achieved by reduced feedback gains, for terrain requiring precise foot placement (e.g. climbing rocks, walking over pegs or cracks) compliance cannot be introduced at the cost of inferior tracking. Thus, model-based control and - in contrast to passive dynamic walkers - active balance control is required. To achieve these objectives, in this paper we add two crucial elements to legged locomotion, i.e., floating-base inverse dynamics control and predictive force control, and we show that these elements increase robustness in face of unknown and unanticipated perturbations (e.g. obstacles). Furthermore, we introduce a novel line-based COG trajectory planner, which yields a simpler algorithm than traditional polygon based methods and creates the appropriate input to our control system.We show results from both simulation and real world of a robotic dog walking over non-perceived obstacles and rocky terrain. The results prove the effectivity of the inverse dynamics/force controller. The presented results show that we have all elements needed for robust all-terrain locomotion, which should also generalize to other legged systems, e.g., humanoid robots."
2151006,22736,23735,Gait Generation For Legged Robots,1992,"Ahstruct-Gait generation is the formulation and selection of a sequence of coordinated leg and body motions that propel a legged robot along a desired path. Approaches to gait generation can be classified into control, behavioral, rule-based, and constraintbased paradigms. We survey these models of gait generation and introduce the Ambler, a hexapod robot that can circulate its legs to produce unique gaits. Then we present kinematic, collision, terrain, support, and stability constraints available for gait generation, and discuss our progress using a constraint-based method to generate the Ambler's gait. I. INTRODUCTION In comparison to wheeled mechanisms, legged rnechnisms require complex design, move slowly, and are difficult to control. However, for locomotion over rough or discontinuous terrain, legged mech'anisms are potentially superior to wheeled mech,uiisms.[ 11 Legged mechanisms make discrete terrain contacts and avoid undesirable footholds while wheeled mechanisms have rollers in continuous contact with the ground. The posture of a wheeled mechanism is dependent upon the terrain, but a legged mechanism can isolate its body from tlie ten ani- ' achieving a more stable stunce' and allowing smooth level motion. Legged locomotion is theoretically more energy efficient because body propulsion does not expend as much energy in soil compaction and body motion can occur in a level plane decoupled from the effects of gravity. Legged mechanisms can actively position their center of gravity to maximize stability. Dead reckoning (estimating position by integrating motion over time) can be more accurate in a legged machine where feet make discrete contacts and do not slip or skid like a wheel. The complexity in the design of legged mechanisms can be achieved, a$ is demonstrated by the working systems examined in this paper. We believe that the slow, smooth motion of legged devices is advantageous in rough terrain where caution (and, sometimes, sensing) will limit the speed of wheeled and legged mechanisms alike. The significant drawback to legs has been the difficulty in control. For a slow-moving walker, this challenge is not in moving the individual legs, a$ this is directly analogous to well-unders tood manipulator control, but in the coordination of leg and body motions. The legged robot, either with a real-time controller, low-level planner, or as an artifact of its architecture, must generate a sequence of leg and body motions, a gait, that will propel it along some path. Gait yeneralion is the formulation and selection of a sequence of coordinated leg and body motions that propcl the robot along a desired path. In this paper we survey several approaches taken toward gait generation aid present some of and discuss our work on gait generation for the Ambler."
1648692,22736,23735,Human-swarm interaction using spatial gestures,2014,"This paper presents a machine vision based ap- proach for human operators to select individual and groups of autonomous robots from a swarm of UAVs. The angular distance between the robots and the human is estimated using measures of the detected human face, which aids to determine human and multi-UAV localization and positioning. In turn, this is exploited to effectively and naturally make the human select the spatially situated robots. Spatial gestures for selecting robots are presented by the human operator using tangible input devices (i.e., colored gloves). To select individuals and groups of robot we formulate a vocabulary of two-handed spatial pointing gestures. With the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained in a cascaded multi-binary-class configuration, the spatial gestures are effectively learned and recognized by a swarm of UAVs. I. INTRODUCTION Without the use of teleoperated and hand-held interaction devices, human operators generally face difficulties in select- ing and commanding individual and groups of robots from a relatively large group of spatially distributed robots (i.e., a swarm). However, due to the widespread availability of cost effective digital cameras onboard UGVs and UAVs, it is increasing the attention towards developing uninstrumented methods (i.e., methods that do not use sophisticated hardware devices from the human side) for human-swarm interaction (HSI). In previous work, we focused on learning efficient features incrementally (online) from multi-viewpoint images of multiple gestures that were acquired by a swarm of ground robots (1). In this paper, we present a cascaded supervised machine learning approach to deal with the machine vision problem of selecting 3D spatially-situated robots from a networked swarm based on the recognition of spatial hand gestures. These are a natural, easy recognizable, and device- less way to enable human operators to easily interact with external artifacts such as robots. Inspired by natural human behavior, we propose an ap- proach that combines face engagement and pointing gestures to interact with a swarm of robots: standing in front of a population of robots, by looking at them and pointing at them with spatial gestures, a human operator can designate individual or groups of robots of determined size. Robots cooperate to combine their independent observations of the human's face and gestures to cooperatively determine which robots were addressed (i.e., selected). While state of the art computer vision techniques pro- vide excellent face detection, human skeleton, and gesture recognition in ideal conditions, there are often occlusions,"
1664963,22736,23735,Intuitive Skill-Level Programming of Industrial Handling Tasks on a Mobile Manipulator,2014,"In order for manufacturing companies to remain competitive while also offering a high degree of customization for the customers, flexible robots that can be rapidly repro- grammed to new tasks need to be applied in the factories. In this paper we propose a method for the intuitive programming of an industrial mobile robot by combining robot skills, a graphical user interface and human gesture recognition. We give a brief introduction to robot skills as we envision them for intuitive programming, and how they are used in the robot system. We then describe the tracking and gesture recognition, and how the instructor uses the method for programming. We have verified our approach through experiments on several subjects, showing that the system is generally easy to use even for inexperienced users. Furthermore, the programming time required to program a new task is very short, especially keeping traditional industrial robot programming methods in mind. I. INTRODUCTION Manufacturing companies have experienced the challenges of mass customization for a long period of time. As cus- tomers demand more customization options for products, tra- ditional mass production becomes problematic. While mass production focuses on producing large volumes of identical items with high efficiency, mass customization needs to maintain the production volume, but also offer products with a highly varied feature set. In order to do this, flexible robotic solutions appear more promising than stationary robot cells. A key issue of flexible robots is to be able to reprogram them on the fly when a new task is needed in the factory. Currently, industrial robots are programmed by experts to do specific motions and follow specific paths in a highly structured environment. In order for the robots to be truly flexible, they need to be able to handle a variety of different tasks, and they must be reprogrammed fast when a new task in the factory arises. In this paper, we propose a method for intuitive and fast programming of a mobile industrial robot using robot skills in conjunction with a graphical user interface and human gestures. Using the skills as fundamental building blocks, it is easy for a shop floor worker to form complex tasks. The skills need to be supplied with parameters, stating on which objects they should be executed, e.g. the Pick up   skill needs to know which object to pick up. The sequencing of skills is done on a touchpad device, and the teaching of the parameters for the individual skills are done by performing specific gestures, such as pointing at objects to pick up."
1245295,22736,23735,Exploiting global force torque measurements for local compliance estimation in tactile arrays,2014,"In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the local compliance of tactile arrays exploiting global mea- surements from a single force and torque sensor. The proposed procedure exploits a transformation matrix (describing the relative position between the local tactile elements and the global force/torque measurements) to define a linear regression problem on the unknown local stiffness. Experiments have been conducted on the foot of the iCub robot, sensorized with a single force/torque sensor and a tactile array of 250 taxels on the foot sole. Results show that a simple calibration procedure can be employed to estimate the stiffness parameters of virtual springs over a tactile array and to use these model to predict normal forces exerted on the array based only on the tactile feedback. Leveraging on previous works (1) we show that the proposed procedure does not necessarily need a-priori information on the transformation matrix of the tactile elements (taxels) which can be directly estimated from available measurements. I. INTRODUCTION One of the main challenges for current legged robotic platforms is to operate in unstructured environments and safely traverse rough terrains. To improve the adaptability to different grounds several approaches have been proposed, which consist of mechanical solutions to regulate the leg's active and passive properties and new sensors for enhancing environmental sensing. In particular to let robots overcame their current limitations, we need to advance their capability in perception of the environment physical properties. As to this concern it becomes important to understand how it is possible to improve the quality of haptic information and how to better integrate acquisitions from different sensors. During locomotion the most important haptic informations are represented by the contact forces between terrain and robot feet. These forces have a great relevance in stabilizing the robot because it is throughout these forces that the robot can actuate the underactuated degrees of freedom, like the center of mass (CoM) position and the floating base orientation. So far, starting from the simplifying assumption that the contact area is planar and has the necessary friction to keep the feet from sliding, different theoretical frameworks have been developed to regulate contact forces during tasks such as locomotion. In the late sixties, kinematic controllers solely"
1135190,22736,23735,Decentralized and complete multi-robot motion planning in confined spaces,2014,"This paper presents the Push-Swap-Wait (PSW) algorithm, a scalable, decentralized and complete approach for multi-robot motion planning in confined spaces. The algorithm builds upon a push and swap paradigm that has been used effectively in centralized navigation. This push and swap approach was expanded to apply to decentralized planning by adding a waiting mode to handle situations in which communication between robots is lost. The completeness of the PSW algorithm can be guaranteed in cases where the environment can be modeled as a tree T for which the number of leaf nodes is greater than the number of robots navigating through it. The algorithm has a time complexity that is linear with the number of robots currently within communication, indicating that this algorithm is well suited for scaling to large systems of robots. To validate the PSW algorithm it was implemented successfully in multi-robot simulations and on hardware with four Dr. Robot Jaguar Lite Robots. I. INTRODUCTION Multi-robot systems have demonstrated the potential to increase performance over single robot systems in tasks re- quiring decreased mission times, spatio-temporal sampling, robustness to mission failure, and force multiplication (2), (5). This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the motion of multiple robots attempting to reach their indepen- dent goal destinations in single lane tunnel environments. In general, Multi Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) can be accomplished with acentralized control architecture, in which one robot or agent dictates the motion of all robots, or using a decentralized architecture in which each robot calculates its own motions. Additionally, the algorithms im- plemented within these architectures can either be coupled, in which the algorithm searches the composite configuration space of all robots to construct paths for all robots, or decoupled, in which the algorithms search each individual robot's configuration space for individual paths that are later coordinated. Implementation of both coupled and decoupled planning can be centralized, but decentralized architectures are more amenable to decoupled planning. Several centralized approaches for robot navigation in confined spaces already exist (14), (10), (11), (3). Some of these algorithms have the desirable property of being complete - that is, they guarantee that a solution will be found if it exists. Such algorithms can also be classified as either optimal or non-optimal. Optimal algorithms, such as search algorithms like A*, are capable of computing the"

Several studies on arm slew control under attitude disturbance due to arm motion were carried out using the kinematics of a base free robot (3,4). These methods require accurate knowledge of the mass/inertia property of a robot, and complex computation. Furthermore, the torque control of the actuator and thrust force of gas jet thrusters are necessary in the case of inverse dynamics control. These are not realistic for practical applications in space. Moreover, there are few papers discussing other important maneuvers before and after arm slew control required for in-orbit servicing. It is important to study control problems for overall task achievement including the flying maneuver and manipulation with momentum exchange according to practical space missions. In this paper, we deal with a series of control problems in a satellite retrieval mission which requires flying approach, capturing, docking and berthing.

1410048,22736,23735,Attention driven grasping for clearing a heap of objects,2012,"Generation of grasps for automated object manipulation in cluttered scenarios presents major challenges for various modules of the pipeline such as 2D/3D visual processing, 3D modeling, grasp hypothesis generation, grasp planning and path planning. In this paper, we present a solution framework for solving a complex instance of the problem - represented by a heap of unknown and unstructured objects in a bounded environment - in our case, a box; with the goal being removing all objects in the box using an attention driven object modeling approach to cognitive grasp planning. The focus of the algorithm delves on Grasping by Components (GBC), with a prioritization scheme derived from scene based attention and attention driven segmentation. In order to overcome the traditional challenge of segmentation performing poorly in cluttered scenes, we employ a novel active segmentation approach suited to our scenario. While the attention module helps prioritize objects in the heap and salient regions, the GBC scheme segments out parts and generates grasp hypotheses for each part. GBC is a very important component of any scalable and holistic grasping system since it abstracts point cloud object data with parametric shapes and no apriori knowledge (such as 3D models) is required. Earlier work in 3D model building (such as CAD based, simple geometries, bounding boxes, Superquadrics etc.) have depended on precise shape and pose recognition as well as exhaustive training to learn or exhaustive searching in grasp space to generate good grasp hypotheses. These methods are not scalable for real-time scenarios, complex shapes and unknown environments - key challenges in robotic grasping. In order to alleviate this concern, we present a novel parametric algorithm to estimate grasp points and approach vectors from the 3D parametric shape model, along with innovative schemes to optimize the computation of the parametric models as well as to refine the generated grasp hypotheses based on the scene information to aid path planning. We present evaluation of our complex grasping pipeline for cluttered heaps through a series of test sequences involving removal of objects from a box, along with evaluations for our attention mechanisms, active segmentation, 3D model fitting optimizations and quality of our grasp hypotheses."
862461,22736,23735,Identification of HRP-2 foot's dynamics,2014,"This paper describes the identification of HRP-2 foot's dynamics. It is expected that a humanoid robot will work in the same environment as man. For that purpose, safety of operation is important. Although a simulator is used for con- firming safe conditions of operation, an error may arise in a dynamic parameter by the robot of a simulator, and an actual robot. In this paper, it identified about the viscoelasticity of the sole bush for impact absorption at the time of the walk of hu- manoid robot HRP-2. We used some simple active motions and composed these motions. We identified parameter using com- posed motions. We finally compare the identified parameters using the experimental results and simulator results. I. INTRODUCTION With the developments of the robotics, humanoid robot that can interact with human is now expected. It is necessary to know the exact dynamics for controlling such a robot. For example, computed torque method (1) is usually used to control a robot and this method requires a precise dynamic model of the robot. However, errors often come out of the robot's dynamic model since they often use CAD data. Moreover, the classic identification of using torque or their estimation (2) is subject to various influences about a joint. Therefore, the base-link identification method presented in (3) which does not require the torque measurements is useful to identify the dynamics of complex systems, in particular humanoid robots (4). A two-legged robot contacts chiefly with its environment by the sole of its feet. Therefore, in order to absorb the shock at the time of walking, rubber bushes are used. The rubber bush has a complex structure. This structure must be simulated in the robot dynamic simulator to achieve realistic simulations and model-based control. The accuracy of the inertial pa- rameters and the viscoelastic parameters specific to the robot is crucial to simulate the robot motions accurately. In this research, after identifying the inertial parameters of the hu- manoid robot HRP-2 as presented in (3), we now identify the viscoelastic properties of the sole rubber bush. In this paper, we use the equation of viscoelasticity iden- tification of a bush from a base link equation of motion. In order to increase identification accuracy, we generated some simple exciting motions. We used active motions and con- catenate these motions. We finally compare the identified parameters using the experimental results and simulator re- sults."
1852580,22736,23735,Manipulation And Active Sensing By Pushing Using Tactile Feedback,1992,"We investigate manipulation and active sensing by a pushing control system using only tactile feedback. The equations of motion of a pushed object are derived using a model of the object's limit surface, and we design a control system to translate and orient objects. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is confirmed through simulation and experiments. Active sensing of the object's center of mass is described. I. INTRODUCTTON Pushing is a useful robotic capability for positioning and orienting parts. Several researchers have demonstrated the utility of pushing operations by planning open-loop pushing sequences to position and orient polygonal objects despite the presence of uncertainty in the initial state (l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 71. These operations typically plan for a known object shape and center of mass (CM) and a flat pushing fence or specially designed pusher geomehy to exploit the mechanics of pushing. Others have proposed pushing control systems based on visual feedback (8,9). The pusher makes point contact with the object, and the position and orientation of the object is determined by a vision system. The goal is to push the object along a desired trajectory. Uncertainty in the frictional forces governing the object's motion is compensated for by the appropriate design of a feedback controller. The purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of useful manipulation by a pushing control system using only tactile feedback. Try closing your eyes and controlling the motion of an object on a table by pushing it with a finger. This is the type of capability we would like to give a robot. In contrast to vision, tactile sensing requires very little data processing. The tactile sensor is mounted directly on the manipulator and the robot requires no peripheral sensors. The primary difficulty arises from the fact that tactile sensing can only give local contactinformation. Theconfigurationof theobjecthas three degrees-of-freedom: two position coordinates and an orientation. When the pusher is in contact with the object, these three degrees-of- freedom may be equivalently expressed by the location of the pushing contact, the contact point on the perimeter of the object, and the orientation of the object. The tactile sensor we use is capable of sensing the contact location and the object orientation at the contact, but not the contact point on the object. With vision, all three degrees- of-freedom are directly sensed. Despite this missing information, we demonstrate that simple manipulation is possible by pushing using only tactile feedback. Specifically, we implement a controller to translate the object and regulate its orientation."
2340181,22736,23735,A Fast Searching Method For Precision Parts Mating Based Upon Fuzzy Logic Approach,1992,"The difficulties in devising reliable assembly strategies result from tlie complexity and the uncertainties of the assembly process and its environments such as imperfect knowledge of the parts being assembled as well as the limitations of the assembly devices performing the assembly. To cope with these problems, we presented a new fuzzy rulebased assembly algorithm for precision parts mating(l7). However, the previous method has limitation in mating precision parts because the parameters in the fuzzy control algorithm were fixed, resulting in rather slow search time. To cope with such limitation, this paper presents a technique which can significantly reduce the search time. The presented technique is based upon the fact that adjustable factors in fuzzy algorithm largely influence the assembly performance. Especially, this investigation focuses on the effect of the output scaling factor. Experimental results show that the proper selection of scaling factors can effectively improve the assembly vagueness associated with actual assembly phenomena. Also, the linguistic fiizzy rules desc.ribed by IF-THEN not only can overcome the diffficulties caused by analytic models but also can effectively construct human thinking and knowledge. However, the previous presented technique had a critical limitation in that the technique requires too much searchin effort for the case of corrective motion generated from the fuzzy rules. Moreover, although control performance was lar ely affected by some fuzzy partitioning and the shape of membership function for a primary fuzzy set, the effect of these parameters was not considered. This pa,per, therefore, investigates the effect of scaling factors on assembly performance arid presents a fast searching technique for large initial error based upon the fuzzy rules. This technique consists of two modes: The one is a fine compensation mode whicli is activated in case of small error, while the other is a coarse compensation mode which is activated in case of large error. The above two modes are switched by heuristically adjusting the output scaling factors depending on the magnitude of errors. The performance of the presented method is evaluated through a series of experiments for chamferless peg-in-hole tasks. large initial error(above lmm) because"
1896759,22736,23735,Development and evaluation of the second version of scrub nurse robot (SNR) for endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery,2007,"The shortage of nurses in large hospitals of developed countries has become a major problem. Especially, the shortage of scrub nurses, who assist operating surgeons exchange surgical instruments, has been chronically severe. To compensate for this shortage, we have been proposing the scrub nurse robot (SNR) system that is capable of functioning as a skilled human scrub nurse in endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery. We developed the 2nd version of SNR, and achieved smooth and wide movement of its arms each with 4 DOF. The 2nd SNR is able to speak several sentences and recognize some words as well as the names of surgical instruments, and is also capable of recognizing a surgeon's intraoperative actions by its real-time visual recognition system (RTVRS). The RTVRS is basically composed of both a commercially-available 3D position tracking system and the algorithm that we developed to recognize surgeons' actions during exchange of instruments from the above-mentioned positional data. In this paper, we evaluated how quickly and timely the RTVRS-driven SNR helped surgeon's stand-ins exchange instruments in a laboratory, in comparison with human scrub nurses in real surgical operations. We found two problems about the current RTVRS-driven SNR: one is its response time and the other is chiefly related to the design and mechanism of the part storing the surgical instruments. 1) Concerning the first problem, the RTVRS-driven SNR took 2.11 sec until it finished holding out its hand with an instrument after it had detected a surgeon's stand-in's motions observed during extraction of a surgical instrument. However, a skilled real surgeon took 1.90 sec until he got the requested instrument in the clinical cases although he had to wait for as long as 1.24 sec until receiving it. Therefore, we must speed up the SNR's performance at least by 0.2 sec to assist the real surgeon as human scrub nurses did. Especially, since 0.68 sec out of the 2.11 sec was spent in data processing within the current RTVRS, we conclude that the performance of the RTVRS must be improved rather than speed-up of its arm movement. 2) The other problem was highlighted by measurement of the time during which the stand-ins and the real surgeon had to take their eyes from the monitor displaying the operative field within the abdomen. We termed this period of time 'eyes-off time. The existence of 'eyes-off' time observed during his actions of returning an instrument after use and of waiting for the next instrument was regarded as unfavorable. The 'eyes-off' time was 2.34 sec in the laboratory whereas it was 0.19 sec in the clinical cases. The much longer 'eyes-off' time in the laboratory was partly due to inexperienced stand-ins' performances, but mainly because of the design and mechanism of the part storing the instruments (a tool changer). To overcome these two problems, we are now developing the next version of SNR."
832117,22736,23735,A Representation Method Based on the Probability of Collision for Safe Robot Navigation in Domestic Environments,2014,"This paper introduces a three-dimensional volu- metric representation for safe navigation. It is based on the OctoMap representation framework that probabilistically fuses sensor measurements to represent the occupancy probability of volumes. To achieve safe navigation in a domestic environment this representation is extended with a model of the occupancy probability if no sensor measurements are received, and a proactive approach to deal with unpredictably moving obstacles that can arise from behind occlusions by always expecting obstacles to appear on the robot's path. By combining the occupancy probability of volumes with the position uncertainty of the robot, a probability of collision is obtained. It is shown that by relating this probability to a safe velocity limit a robot in a real domestic environment can move close to a certain maximum velocity but decides to attain a slower safe velocity limit when it must, analogous to velocity limits and warning signs in traffic. I. INTRODUCTION Robots that navigate in indoor, domestic environments face an environment that encompasses obstacles and uncer- tainties. Obstacles generally vary in their size and shape and can be static as well as dynamic. Uncertainty typically arises from three sources (1): (i) sensing uncertainty due to noisy and false sensor measurements, (ii) uncertainty about the environment due to (partially) unknown parts of that environment and (iii) robot position uncertainty due to localization errors and external disturbances acting on the robot. In the presence of these characteristics a robot always needs to guarantee that it is safe, i.e., that it can ensure to come to a timely stop when a collision is imminent. Safe navigation can be achieved by moving a robot at very low velocities, typically below 0.1 m/s. However, by incorporating knowledge on the environment a robot can move with higher velocities without becoming unsafe. Approaches to safe navigation in a domestic environment generally consist of a motion planner that represents the environment and searches and executes a path through this represented environment. A representation of the environ- ment that is three-dimensional is a prerequisite to deal with the challenges that a typical domestic environment poses (2). Approximate cell decompositions are a common and popular approach to manage this representation (3), (4). Searching and executing a path in an environment with obstacles and uncertainties is typically achieved using a planner that finds"
2268178,22736,23735,Camera Placement For Global Vision,1992,"Stationary visual cameras, or what is termed global vision, can be used to provide the information necessary for the control of multiple free-ranging auto- matic guided vehicles in order to expand the range of applications for which they are a high-performance and cost-effective transport alternative. The camera placement problem of global vision refers to determining, for a given facility layout, a minimal number of cameras necessary to implement global vision-based control and their positions in the facility. In this paper, the camera placement prob- lem of global vision is formulated and analyzed for its computational complexity and is shown to be NP-hard, and a convex hull-based greedy algorithm is described for its approximate solution. I. INTRODUCTION Stationary visual cameras, or what is termed global vision, can be used to provide the information necessary for the control of free-ranging automatic guided vehicle (AGV) systems. Global vision provides a means to robustly control AGV systems composed of large numbers of low-cost free- ranging vehicles that are able to operate in unrestricted indoor environments. The sensory information used for the control of the free-ranging AGV system is provided by global vision and low-cost range sensors on board each vehicle. A system with these capabilities will expand the range of applications for which they are a high-performance and cost-effective material transport alternative. The development of a means to achieve these capabilities was the principal motivation for proposing global vision-based free-ranging AGV control (3). Global vision refers to the use of cameras placed at fixed locations in a workspace to extend the local sensing available on board each vehicle in a free-ranging AGV system. Information from the cameras is used to (a) monitor the workspace to detect and track potential obstacles both in the immediate vicinity of each AGV and over its intended path; (b) track each AGV along its intended path to bound errors in the vehicle's dead-reckoning sensors; (c) monitor the load aboard each AGV to detect positioning errors; and, as a side benefit, (d) provide video images of the entire workspace so that a human operator can monitor the status of operations throughout the facility. Figure 1 shows the major components of global vision- based AGV control. The cameras for global vision are placed at fixed locations throughout a facility. Their unprocessed video signals are sent both to TV screens, where they could be used to monitor the status of on-going operations, and to a central processing site, where global vision-based vehicle control takes place. The status of the AGV system is available as input to high-level transport control functions (e.g., vehicle dispatching). Although only two cameras are shown in the figure, more cameras would typically be used in practice. Each vehicle has a communications link with the central pro- cessing site to receive control commands and to transmit the results of its on-board sensing operations. A.

2474791,22736,23735,Real-time estimate of period derivatives using adaptive oscillators: Application to impedance-based walking assistance,2012,"Inferring temporal derivatives (like velocity and acceleration) from a noisy position signal is a well-known challenge in control engineering, due to the intrinsic trade-off between noise filtering and estimation bandwidth. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a new approach specifically designed for periodic movements. This approach uses an adaptive oscillator as fundamental building block. It is a tool capable of synchronizing to a periodic input while learning its features (frequency, amplitude, …) in dedicated state variables. Since the oscillator's input and output are perfectly synchronized during steady-state regime, a non-delayed estimate of the input temporal derivatives can be obtained simply by deriving the output analytical form. Pending a (quasi-)periodic input signal, these temporal derivatives are thus synchronized with the actual kinematics, while the signal bandwidth can be arbitrarily tuned by the intrinsic dynamics of the oscillator. We further validate this approach by developing an impedance-based strategy for assisting human walking in the LOPES lower-limb exoskeleton. Preliminary results with a single participant give rise to three main conclusions. First, our method indeed provides velocity and acceleration estimates of the participant's joint kinematics which are smoother and less delayed with respect to the actual kinematics than using a standard Kalman filter. Second, closing the human-robot loop with a high-gain impedance field depending on the acceleration is not possible with a Kalman filter approach, due to unstable dynamics. In contrast, our approach tolerates high gains (up to 70% of the nominal walking torque), showing its intrinsic stability. Finally, no clear benefit of the acceleration-dependent field with respect to a simpler position-dependent field is visible regarding the reduction of metabolic cost. This last result illustrates the challenge of designing sound assistive strategies for complex tasks like walking."
2181895,22736,23735,Watertight surface reconstruction of caves from 3D laser data,2011,"The generation of accurate, watertight, three-dimensional models of environments are often crucial for the purposes of scientific study and infrastructure management. Most commonly, such models are acquired by using range sensors producing point clouds, and further processing steps are required for the construction of a surface model. We used a mobile lidar to map several kilometers of a natural cave system in order to obtain 3D volumetric models for use in scientific research studying the local palaeo-climatic record. For unstructured and GPS-denied environments, such as cave systems, the process of acquiring a complete map is difficult and further complicated by limited mobility within the cave. During the mapping process, many unwanted measurements occur due to occlusions from moving objects such as other people present in the cave. Most common point cloud surface reconstruction techniques are not designed to deal these occlusions; i.e., they require manual cleanup of the data set or are not capable of generating watertight surfaces. The large scale of the environments introduces the additional challenge of dealing with memory limitations. We propose a new volume-based approach to reconstruct a watertight surface from range measurements of enclosed environments without limitation on the scale of the collected data. Our approach carves all unoccupied voxels from the sensor to a triangulated and rasterized surface between successive scans, which is intended to fill in the missing data between the scan rays. The surface is then constructed from the isosurface between unoccupied and unknown cells. By decomposing the space, we are able to handle large-scale data without exceeding the memory limitation of a standard PC, at the cost of some additional computation time. The algorithm has been evaluated across several datasets within a variety of environments and observed to build more complete volumetric models than a simple space carving approach. We have mapped several kilometers of cave networks and, with the described method, produced watertight reconstructions suitable for further scientific analysis."
1483859,22736,23735,Probabilistic surface classification for rover instrument targeting,2013,"Communication blackouts and latency are significant bottlenecks for planetary surface exploration; rovers cannot typically communicate during long traverses, so human operators cannot respond to unanticipated science targets discovered along the route. Targeted data collection by point spectrometers or high-resolution imagery requires precise aim, so it typically happens under human supervision during the start of each command cycle, directed at known targets in the local field of view. Spacecraft can overcome this limitation using onboard science data analysis to perform autonomous instrument targeting. Two critical target selection capabilities are the ability to target priority features of a known geologic class, and the ability to target anomalous surfaces that are unlike anything seen before. This work addresses both challenges using probabilistic surface classification in traverse images. We first describe a method for targeting known classes in the presence of high measurement cost that is typical for power- and time-constrained rover operations. We demonstrate a Bayesian approach that abstains from uncertain classifications to significantly improve the precision of geologic surface classifications. Our results show a significant increase in classification performance, including a seven-fold decrease in misclassification rate for our random forest classifier. We then take advantage of these classifications and learned scene context in order to train a semi-supervised novelty detector. Operators can train the novelty detection to ignore known content from previous scenes, a critical requirement for multi-day rover operations. By making use of prior scene knowledge we find nearly double the number of abnormal features detected over comparable algorithms. We evaluate both of these techniques on a set of images acquired during field expeditions in the Mojave Desert."
1292493,22736,23735,Cooperative human robot interaction systems: IV. Communication of shared plans with Naïve humans using gaze and speech,2013,"Cooperation 1  is at the core of human social life. In this context, two major challenges face research on humanrobot interaction: the first is to understand the underlying structure of cooperation, and the second is to build, based on this understanding, artificial agents that can successfully and safely interact with humans. Here we take a psychologically grounded and human-centered approach that addresses these two challenges. We test the hypothesis that optimal cooperation between a naïve human and a robot requires that the robot can acquire and execute a joint plan, and that it communicates this joint plan through ecologically valid modalities including spoken language, gesture and gaze. We developed a cognitive system that comprises the human-like control of social actions, the ability to acquire and express shared plans and a spoken language stage. In order to test the psychological validity of our approach we tested 12 naïve subjects in a cooperative task with the robot. We experimentally manipulated the presence of a joint plan (vs. a solo plan), the use of task-oriented gaze and gestures, and the use of language accompanying the unfolding plan. The quality of cooperation was analyzed in terms of proper turn taking, collisions and cognitive errors. Results showed that while successful turn taking could take place in the absence of the explicit use of a joint plan, its presence yielded significantly greater success. One advantage of the solo plan was that the robot would always be ready to generate actions, and could thus adapt if the human intervened at the wrong time, whereas in the joint plan the robot expected the human to take his/her turn. Interestingly, when the robot represented the action as involving a joint plan, gaze provided a highly potent nonverbal cue that facilitated successful collaboration and reduced errors in the absence of verbal communication. These results support the cooperative stance in human social cognition, and suggest that cooperative robots should employ joint plans, fully communicate them in order to sustain effective collaboration while being ready to adapt if the human makes a midstream mistake."
2076223,22736,23735,Model-based Sensor-based Velocity Control Of Teleoperated Heavy-duty Hydraulic Machines,1992,"This paper presents a method for motion control of a class of heavy-duty hydraulic machines in a resolved teleoperation mode. A model-based sensor-based algorithm is proposed which is applied in conjunction with the closed-loop components. The algorithm is a feedforward load compensating scheme which uses the measured hydraulic line pressures along with an appropriate portion of the hydraulic model to control the joint velocities. The scheme incorporates a logic system which, according to the states relevant to the machine task, decides on the minimum portion of the hydraulic model to be used. Inclusion of this algorithm eliminates most of the effects of loading, coupled actuation and single joint power limitations, which allows easier implementation of the closed-loop part. A knowledge of some hydraulic parameters is the only requirement of this scheme. No knowledge about the structure or loading is necessary. I. INTRODUCTION There exist many industrial tasks that are performed in di- verse and unstructured surroundings. Examples of these tasks can be found in the forest, mining and construction industries These industries utilize many heavy-duty machines (such as excavators, feller bunchers or log loaders) that have linked me- chanical structures, actuated through coupled and complex hydraulic systems. The present control of these machines is based on individually actuating each link by an operator which requires significant visual feedback, judgement and skill. These machines do not benefit from computer-assisted con- trols; however, they have the potential to be automated. This paper presents a novel application of teleoperation to such industrial machines. In teleoperation, the operator's commands are passed to a computer which is interfaced to the machine and performs the actual control. At least three benefits can be achieved. Firstly, the human's operation of the machine can be coordi- nated. Secondly, the computer can check for incipient machine failures. Thirdly, repetitive operations can be automated un- der supervision of the human."
2061868,22736,23735,Optimal control of multi-input SMA actuator arrays using graph theory: Expanding wavefront & simultaneous operations,2011,"Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are compact and have high force-to-weight ratios, making them strong candidates to actuate robots, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. However, these actuators are thermomechanical in nature and slow cooling rates can limit their performance. To improve the convective cooling, SMA wires have been embedded in vascular networks allowing cold fluid to pass across the actuators to cool/extend them. The vascular network can also deliver hot fluid to heat and contract the wire. In addition to the fluidic network, an electrical network operating in parallel can resistively heat the SMA to produce contraction. To minimize the weight and size of the vascular and electrical networks, a scalable N×N architecture has been implemented that allows for 2N control devices (valves, transistors) to be shared amongst N 2  actuators. This Network Array Architecture (NAA) allows each actuator to be controlled individually or in discrete subarrays. However, this architecture does not allow all combinations of actuators to be activated simultaneously; therefore in general a sequence of control commands will need to be executed in order to achieve the complete actuation. In order to find an optimal sequence of control commands, graph theory algorithms have been implemented. By treating each actuator's state as binary (fully contracted or extended), the collected states of an actuator array can be represented as nodes of the graph and the control commands as the graph edges. By properly weighting the costs of the graph edges, search algorithms can be used to find an optimal set of control commands for desired state changes. NAA results in a multigraph that has 2 N×N  nodes and is highly interconnected. While initial work in this area established the basic validity of a graph search approach for NAA control, this article presents a scalable method of determining the optimal set of controls to minimize the operating cost (time and energy) and computational search cost."
2335187,22736,23735,"Towards a platform-independent cooperative human-robot interaction system: II. Perception, execution and imitation of goal directed actions",2011,"If robots are to cooperate with humans in an increasingly human-like manner, then significant progress must be made in their abilities to observe and learn to perform novel goal directed actions in a flexible and adaptive manner. The current research addresses this challenge. In CHRIS.I [1], we developed a platform-independent perceptual system that learns from observation to recognize human actions in a way which abstracted from the specifics of the robotic platform, learning actions including “put X on Y” and “take X”. In the current research, we extend this system from action perception to execution, consistent with current developmental research in human understanding of goal directed action and teleological reasoning. We demonstrate the platform independence with experiments on three different robots. In Experiments 1 and 2 we complete our previous study of perception of actions “put” and “take” demonstrating how the system learns to execute these same actions, along with new related actions “cover” and “uncover” based on the composition of action primitives “grasp X” and “release X at Y”. Significantly, these compositional action execution specifications learned on one iCub robot are then executed on another, based on the abstraction layer of motor primitives. Experiment 3 further validates the platform-independence of the system, as a new action that is learned on the iCub in Lyon is then executed on the Jido robot in Toulouse. In Experiment 4 we extended the definition of action perception to include the notion of agency, again inspired by developmental studies of agency attribution, exploiting the Kinect motion capture system for tracking human motion. Finally in Experiment 5 we demonstrate how the combined representation of action in terms of perception and execution provides the basis for imitation. This provides the basis for an open ended cooperation capability where new actions can be learned and integrated into shared plans for cooperation. Part of the novelty of this research is the robots' use of spoken language understanding and visual perception to generate action representations in a platform independent manner based on physical state changes. This provides a flexible capability for goal-directed action imitation."
1046839,22736,23735,Towards Valve Turning using a Dual-Arm Aerial Manipulator,2014,"We propose a framework for valve turning using an aerial vehicle endowed with dual multi-degree of freedom manipulators. A tightly integrated control scheme between the aircraft and manipulators is mandated for tasks requiring aircraft to environmental coupling. Feature detection is well- established for both ground and aerial vehicles and facilitates valve detection and arm tracking. Force feedback upon contact with the environment provides compliant motions in the pres- ence of position error and coupling with the valve. We present recent results validating the valve turning framework using the proposed aircraft-arm system during flight tests. I. INTRODUCTION Valve turning represents a classic controls problem along with insertion tasks and tool usage. The ground robotics community has largely solved these problems. There are many examples of door opening, using a drill, assembly of structures, and inserting a power plug by ground vehicles with one or more dexterous arms. Many of these tasks require position and/or force control and typical implementations in- volve force/torque sensing, vision systems, or a combination of these methods. The ground-based system must coordinate the vehicle and arm motions to perform these tasks. While the coupling between the environment (i.e. valve, knob, handle) and robot does influence the vehicle base with added contact forces/torques and friction, the base can typically maintain stability during the entire motion. However, the strong coupling required during valve or knob turning greatly influences the dynamics of an aerial manipulator. Rigidity in the manipulator and the propagation of contact forces when interacting with the environment can cause crashes. There have been recent results where multi-DOF aerial manipulators have experienced coupling with the environment (1)-(4). Other groups have investigated compliance in assembly tasks (5)-(7), or dynamic stability and control w.r.t. center of mass and moment of inertia variations (8)-(10)."
1722869,22736,23735,When shared plans go wrong: From atomic- to composite actions and back,2012,"As elaborate human-robot interaction capabilities continue to develop, humans will increasingly be in proximity with robots, and the management of the ongoing control in case of breakdown becomes increasingly important: taking care of what happens when cooperation goes wrong. The current research addresses three categories of breakdowns where cooperation can go wrong. In the first category, the human detects some type of problem and generates a self-issued stop signal, with a physical palm up posture. In the second category, the human becomes distracted, and physically changes his orientation away from the shared space of cooperation. In the final category that we investigate, the human becomes physically close to the robot such that safety limits are reached and detected by the robot. In each of these three cases, the robot cognitive system detects the failure via the perception of distinct physical states from motion capture: the hand up posture; change in head orientation; and physical distance reaching a minimum threshold. In each case the robot immediately halts the current action. Then, the system should recover appropriately. Each error type returns a specific code, allowing the Supervisor system to handle the specific type of error. Our cognitive system allows the robot to learn composite actions, as a sequence of atomic actions. These composite actions can then be composed into higher level plans. When a plan fails at the level of a composite action, the recovery method is not trivial: should recovery take place at the level of the composite action, or the actual atomic action which physically failed? As the best recovery may depend on the physical context, we expand the plan into atomic actions, and recover at this level, allowing the user to specify whether the action should be skipped or retried. We demonstrate that this system allows graceful recovery from three principal categories of interaction breakdown, and provides an invaluable mechanism for preserving the integrity of cooperative HRI."
1918817,22736,23735,A sighted aerial robot with fast gaze and heading stabilization,2007,"Autonomous guidance of micro-air vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environments is a challenging task because these artificial creatures have small aeromechanical time constants, which make them prone to be disturbed by gusts of wind. Flying insects are subject to quite similar kinds of disturbances, yet they navigate swiftly and deftly. Flying insects display high- performance visuo-motor control systems that have stood the test of time. They can therefore teach us how vision can be used for immediate and vital actions. We built a 50-gram tethered aerial demonstrator, called OSCAR II, which manages to keep its gaze steadily fixating a target (a dark edge), in spite of nasty thumps that we deliberately gave to its body with a custom-made slapping machine. The robot's agile yaw reactions are based on: (1) a mechanical decoupling of the eye from the body, (2) an active coupling of the robot's heading with its gaze, (3) a Visual Fixation Reflex (VFR), (4) a Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), (5) an accurate and fast actuator (voice coil motor, VCM). The actuator is a 2.4-gram voice coil motor that is able to rotate the eye with a rise time as small as 12 ms, that is, much shorter than the rise time of human oculo-motor saccades. In connection with a micro-rate gyro, this actuator endows the robot with a high performance vestibulo ocular reflex that keeps the gaze locked onto the target whatever perturbations in yaw affect the robot's body. Whenever the robot is destabilized (e.g., by a slap applied on one side), the gaze keeps fixating the target, while being the reference to which the robot's heading is servoed. It then takes the robot only 0.6 s to realign its heading with its gaze."
2592198,22736,23735,Passive frontal plane coupling in 3D walking,2015,"This paper explores the use of a single passive design to stabilize frontal plane dynamics for 3D biped walking across a range of forward velocities and/or step lengths. Particular goals are to determine if design of sagittal plane control can be done independently from design of frontal plane stabilization mechanisms, and to explore how dynamic coupling between the two planned motions affects energetic efficiency of walking. Passive dynamic walkers have long utilized curved feet for low energy frontal plane stabilization in 3D walking, with the current design practice of matching the linearized resonance of the curvature to match a particular, steady-state walking gait to achieve stable coupled limit cycle in 3D dynamics. However, practical legged walking systems should operate across a range of velocities and step widths. We examine aspects of the nonlinear dynamics that contribute to the energy efficiency and stability of the system through simulations. Specifically, we focus on the tight coupling between the frontal plane dynamics and stepping speed. We find that roll velocity is strongly coupled to the stepping speed and energy consumption. Our decoupled analysis explains some aspects of the 3D motions; however, the actual effects on cost of transport demonstrate interesting phenomena we had not anticipated. Specifically, while a general trend of increasing cost of transport for 3D vs 2D gaits with stride time does hold in our simulations, the 3D gaits sometimes require less energy than their constrained 2D counterparts, which was a surprising and encouraging result. This work provides a promising direction for the development of practical methods to utilize control designed for planar 2D walking models on more sophisticated 3D dynamic models using little or no additional active control."
2287199,22736,23735,A virtual scalpel system for computer-assisted laser microsurgery,2011,"A medical robotic system for teleoperated laser microsurgery based on a concept we have called “virtual scalpel” is presented in this paper. This system allows surgeries to be safely and precisely performed using a graphics pen directly over a live video from the surgical site. This is shown to eliminate hand-eye coordination problems that affect other microsurgery systems and to make full use of the operator's manual dexterity without requiring extra training. The implementation of this system, which is based on a tablet PC and a new motorized laser micromanipulator offering 1µm aiming accuracy within the traditional line-of-sight 2D operative space, is fully described. This includes details on the system's hardware and software structures and on its calibration process, which is essential for guaranteeing precise matching between a point touched on the live video and the laser aiming point at the surgical site. Together, the new hardware and software structures make both the calibration parameters and the laser aiming accuracy (on any plane orthogonal to the imaging axis) independent of the target distance and of its motions. Automatic laser control based on new intraoperative planning software and safety improvements based on virtual features are also described in this paper, which concludes by presenting results from sets of path following evaluation experiments conducted with 10 different subjects. These demonstrate an error reduction of almost 50% when using the virtual scalpel system versus the traditional laser microsurgery setup, and an 80% error reduction when using the automatic laser control routines, evidencing great improvements in terms of precision and controllability, and suggesting that the technological advances presented herein will lead to a significantly enhanced capacity for treating a variety of internal human pathologies."
1457622,22736,23735,Towards a platform-independent cooperative human-robot interaction system: I. Perception,2010,"One of the long term objectives of robotics and artificial cognitive systems is that robots will increasingly be capable of interacting in a cooperative and adaptive manner with their human counterparts in open-ended tasks that can change in real-time. In such situations, an important aspect of the robot behavior will be the ability to acquire new knowledge of the cooperative tasks by observing humans. At least two significant challenges can be identified in this context. The first challenge concerns development of methods to allow the characterization of human actions such that robotic systems can observe and learn new actions, and more complex behaviors made up of those actions. The second challenge is associated with the immense heterogeneity and diversity of robots and their perceptual and motor systems. The associated question is whether the identified methods for action perception can be generalized across the different perceptual systems inherent to distinct robot platforms. The current research addresses these two challenges. We present results from a cooperative human-robot interaction system that has been specifically developed for portability between different humanoid platforms. Within this architecture, the physical details of the perceptual system (e.g. video camera vs IR video with reflecting markers) are encapsulated at the lowest level. Actions are then automatically characterized in terms of perceptual primitives related to motion, contact and visibility. The resulting system is demonstrated to perform robust object and action learning and recognition on two distinct robotic platforms. Perhaps most interestingly, we demonstrate that knowledge acquired about action recognition with one robot can be directly imported and successfully used on a second distinct robot platform for action recognition. This will have interesting implications for the accumulation of shared knowledge between distinct heterogeneous robotic systems."
669214,22736,23735,A voice-coil actuated ultrasound micro-scanner for intraoral high resolution impression taking,2012,"Silicone based impression-taking of prepared teeth followed by plaster casting is well-established but potentially less reliable, error-prone and inefficient for newly emerging techniques such as computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of dental prosthetics. Intra-oral optical scanners have been introduced to increase efficiency of CAM but no breakthrough occurred so far. Oral liquids such as saliva, blood and sulcular fluid are still one of the main problems since the preparation area must be completely dry. Moreover, sub-gingival preparations need to be uncovered invasively prior to scanning and a reflecting powder coating is required in some cases. High frequency ultrasound (HFUS) has been recently introduced as an alternative to optical scanning. Ultrasound is less sensitive against oral fluids and in principal able to penetrate gingiva in a patient-friendly and cost-effective way. Although HFUS systems have been introduced for ophthalmology, dermatology or small animal imaging, none of them suits the challenging requirements and high accuracy demands for intra-oral micro-scanning of prepared teeth. For this reason, we conceived a new ultrasonic micro-scanning device based on a voice-coil actuated spherically focused HFUS transducer for intra-oral use. The system, which is designed for both highly dynamic accurate positioning and micrometer-resolution, is supplied with a sensor providing position feedback for motion control as well as the ultrasound trigger engine. In this contribution, we describe the set-up and evaluate the lateral displacement of the micro-scanners end-effector with respect to the oscillation rate using laser triangulation. The results are in good agreement to the requirements of an intra-oral ultrasound based micro-scanner."
1577680,22736,23735,Design and flexible modeling of a long reach articulated carrier for inspection,2007,"This work concerns the development of advanced robotic systems for nuclear application. The manipulator will be used for light intervention in spent fuel management facilities. The robot must meet severe specifications: small diameter, long reach within a minimum range of 6 m, high dexterity to move in constrained environment and lots of degrees of freedom (DOF) for obstacle avoidance. In order to meet these requirements, a very challenging robotic carrier (called P.A.C.) which is able to perform light intervention tasks inside high range of blind hot cells using existing engineering penetrations is developed. This long reach multi-link carrier has 11 DOF and weighs less than 30 kg. The gravity effect in the manipulator is largely compensated by a special mechanical structure (the parallelogram) that helps reducing the size of the rotation actuators used to operate the robot. Also, a glass fiber epoxy equilibrium spring is used to compensate the gravity effect over the elevation actuators. A field test is made to measure the robot's repeatability and accuracy by using a laser tracker to measure the end effector's position. Due to its size and weight, this large robot manipulator holds lots of elastic and geometric deformations. Thus it possesses a very low accuracy. A mechanical model is developed to take into account the flexibilities of the structure. This flexible model will be used to improve the accuracy of the manipulator. Applications tests were made to evaluate the ability and performances of the system to meet the operational requirements. The operation took place in an existing decontaminated hot cell and it turned out to be successful."
1889525,22736,9704,"A PSO-based Mobile Sensor Network for Odor Source Localization in Dynamic Environment: Theory, Simulation and Measurement",2006,"This paper presents a problem of odor source localization in a dynamic environment, which means the odor distribution is changing over time. Most work on chemical sensing with mobile robots assume an experimental setup that minimizes the influence of turbulent transport by either minimizing the source-to-sensor distance in trail following or by assuming a strong unidirectional air stream in the environment, including our previous work. However, not much attention has been paid to the natural environment problem. Modification Particle Swarm Optimization is a well-known algorithm, which can continuously track a changing optimum over time. PSO can be improved or adapted by incorporating the change detection and responding mechanisms for solving dynamic problems. Charged PSO, which is another extension of the PSO, has also been applied to solve dynamic problems. Odor source localization is an interesting application in dynamic problems. We will adopt two types of PSO modification concepts to develop a new algorithm in order to control autonomous vehicles. Before applying the algorithm for real implementation, some important hardware conditions must be considered. Firstly, to reduce the possibility of robots leaving the search space, a limit to the value of velocity vector is needed. The value of vector velocity can be clamped to the range [-V max , V max ]; in our case for the MK-01 Robot, the maximum velocity is 0.05 m/s. Secondly, in the standard PSO algorithm there is no collision avoidance mechanism. To avoid the collision among robot we add some collision avoidance functions. Finally, we also add some sensor noise, delay and threshold value to model the sensor response. Then we develop odor localization algorithm, and simulations to show that the new approach can solve such dynamic environment problems."
1018684,22736,23735,Rolling a dynamic object with a planar soft-fingertip robot arm,2013,"Force-position control through one or multiple robots, or fingers, typically assumes a rigid endpoint without rolling nor slipping. However, there are some interesting tasks where rolling is involved, such as turning a knob (object is pivoting at a fixed rotational axis) or rolling a wheel (object rotational axis is moving). In such a case, rigid endpoint force control becomes very difficult if not impossible, even for us humans. This stems from two facts, firstly, infinitesimally small rigid point does not yield a tangent force, therefore it is very difficult to control it indirectly; and secondly, the pair robot-object stands for a highly non-linear constrained underactuated dynamical systems. In this paper, we aim at exploring rolling of a rigid dynamic circular object with hemispherical deformable fingertip, then with area, not point, contact. The dynamic model and a control scheme are presented inspired in previous works, but regulation of normal and tangential forces, as well as position and orientation of the object are synthesized. In particular, tangential force control proves instrumental to regulate posture, and displacement of the object with a simple transpose Jacobian Cartesian PDF+g control. Regulation of rolling angle and displacement with stable normal and tangential forces are obtained without force sensing, neither any model of the deformation nor any dynamic parameter of the object. To entertain these control objectives, a redundant configuration is required so as to yield local regulation, based on the stability-in-the-manifold criteria, whose dimension is greater than the operational space. Illustrative simulations are discussed that provide insight into the closed-loop numerical performance, and finally, remarks on the structure and potential applications are addressed."
1354271,22736,23735,Demonstration-based control of supernumerary robotic limbs,2012,"The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower."
2552232,22736,23735,Closed form characterization of collision free velocities and confidence bounds for non-holonomic robots in uncertain dynamic environments,2015,"Navigating non-holonomic mobile robots in dynamic environments is challenging because it requires computing at each instant, the space of collision free velocities, characterized by a set of highly non-linear and non-convex inequalities. Moreover, uncertainty in obstacle trajectories further increases the complexity of the problem, as it now becomes imperative to relate the space of collision free velocities to a confidence measure. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards analyzing and solving probabilistic collision avoidance constraints based on our previous works on non-linear time scaling. In particular, we have shown earlier that a time scaled version of collision cone constraints can be solved in closed form and thus can be used to efficiently characterize the space of collision free velocities. In the current proposed work, we present a probabilistic version of time scaled collision cone constraints obtained by representing obstacle states through generic probability distributions. We present a novel reformulation of the probabilistic constraints into a family of deterministic algebraic constraints. The solution space of each member of the family can be derived in closed form and at the same time, can also be related to the lower bound on confidence measure through Cantelli's inequality. Thus, the proposed work represents a significant improvement over the current state of the art frameworks where probabilistic collision avoidance constraints are solved through exhaustive sampling in the state-control space. We also present a cost metric which serves as the basis for the construction of the various collision avoidance maneuvers based on factors like deviation from the current path, acceleration/de-acceleration capability of the robot, confidence of collision avoidance etc. We very briefly explain how the current robot state can be connected to the solution space of safe velocities in smooth time optimal fashion. Finally, the validity of the proposed formulation is exhibited through extensive numerical simulation results."
1903499,22736,23735,QoS based framework for ubiquitous robotic services composition,2009,"With the growing emergence of ubiquitous computing and networked systems, ubiquitous robotics is becoming an active research domain. The issue of services composition to offer seamless access to a variety of complex services has received widespread attention in recent years. The majority of the proposed approaches have been inspired from the research undertaken jointly on Workflow and AI-based classical planning techniques. However, the traditional AI-based methods assume that the environment is static and the invocation of the services is deterministic. In ubiquitous robotics, services composition is a challenging issue when the execution environment and services are dynamic and the knowledge about their state and context is uncertain. The services composition requires taking into account the parameters of quality of service (QoS) to adapt the composed service to context of the user and the environment, in particular, dealing with failures such as: service invocation failures, network disconnection, sensor failures, context change due to mobility of objects (robots, sensors, etc.), service discovery failures and service execution failures. In this paper, we present a framework which gives ubiquitous robotic system the ability to dynamically compose and deliver ubiquitous services, and to monitor their execution. The main motivation behind the use of services composition is to decrease time and costs to develop integrated complex applications using robots by transforming them from a single task issuer to smart services provider and human companion, without rebuilding each time the robotic system. To address these new challenges, we propose in this paper a new framework for services composition and monitoring, including QoS estimation and Bayesian learning model to deal with the dynamic and uncertain nature of the environment. This framework includes three levels: abstract plan construction, plan execution, and services discovery and re-composition. This approach is tested under USARSim simulator on a prototype of ubiquitous robotic services for assisting an elderly person at home. The obtained results from extensive tests demonstrate clearly the feasibility and efficiency of our approach."

The present study describes a methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N) deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging, which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum. Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The performance of 84.2% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed leaves."
2131862,22736,23735,A robust and modular multi-sensor fusion approach applied to MAV navigation,2013,"It has been long known that fusing information from multiple sensors for robot navigation results in increased robustness and accuracy. However, accurate calibration of the sensor ensemble prior to deployment in the field as well as coping with sensor outages, different measurement rates and delays, render multi-sensor fusion a challenge. As a result, most often, systems do not exploit all the sensor information available in exchange for simplicity. For example, on a mission requiring transition of the robot from indoors to outdoors, it is the norm to ignore the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals which become freely available once outdoors and instead, rely only on sensor feeds (e.g., vision and laser) continuously available throughout the mission. Naturally, this comes at the expense of robustness and accuracy in real deployment. This paper presents a generic framework, dubbed MultiSensor-Fusion Extended Kalman Filter (MSF-EKF), able to process delayed, relative and absolute measurements from a theoretically unlimited number of different sensors and sensor types, while allowing self-calibration of the sensor-suite online. The modularity of MSF-EKF allows seamless handling of additional/lost sensor signals during operation while employing a state buffering scheme augmented with Iterated EKF (IEKF) updates to allow for efficient re-linearization of the prediction to get near optimal linearization points for both absolute and relative state updates. We demonstrate our approach in outdoor navigation experiments using a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with a GPS receiver as well as visual, inertial, and pressure sensors."
2323133,22736,23735,ARRIpede: A stick-slip micro crawler/conveyor robot constructed via 2 ½D MEMS assembly,2008,"Recent advances in 2frac12D and 3D hybrid microassembly using MEMS snap fasteners and die-level bonding for interconnects, makes possible the miniaturization of exciting new small robots configured for various functions, such as flying, crawling, or jumping. ARRIpede is one example of a ldquodie-sizerdquo crawling microrobot constructed by assembly and die stacking. It consists of a MEMS die ldquobodyrdquo, in-plane electrothermal actuators, vertically assembled legs, and an electronic ldquobackpackrdquo to generate the necessary gait sequence. The robot has been designed using a stick-slip simulation model for a target volume of 1.5 cm times 1.5 cm times 0.5 cm, a 3.8 g mass, and velocities up to 3 mm/s. Even though work remains to be completed in packaging the robot, we demonstrated that the robot design is sound by experimentally evaluating the leg actuation force, the payload carrying capacity, the power consumption, and the manipulation ability of an inverted ARRIpede prototype. A configuration that carries a payload approximately equal to its own weight shows excellent steering ability. A reasonable match between simulations and experiments is noted, for example, when the legs are actuated at 45 Hz and 10 V, the crawling velocity of the microrobot was experimentally measured to be 0.84 mm/s or 18.7 mum per step, while the simulated leg displacement was 18.5 mum per step. The prototyped ldquoconveyorrdquo mode had a maximum measured linear velocity in excess of 1.5 mm/s, while consuming approximately 500 mW of power. We expect that for achieving lower speeds, such as 0.15 mm/s, the power consumption can be reduced to a few mW, enabling untethered operation."
1168545,22736,23735,A case study of trajectory transfer through non-rigid registration for a simplified suturing scenario,2013,"Suturing is an important yet time-consuming part of surgery. A fast and robust autonomous procedure could reduce surgeon fatigue, and shorten operation times. It could also be of particular importance for suturing in remote tele-surgery settings where latency can complicate the master-slave mode control that is the current practice for robotic surgery with systems like the da Vinci®. We study the applicability of the trajectory transfer algorithm proposed in [12] to the automation of suturing. The core idea of this procedure is to first use non-rigid registration to find a 3D warping function which maps the demonstration scene onto the test scene, then use this warping function to transform the robot end-effector trajectory. Finally a robot joint trajectory is generated by solving a trajectory optimization problem that attempts to find the closest feasible trajectory, accounting for external constraints, such as joint limits and obstacles. Our experiments investigate generalization from a single demonstration to differing initial conditions. A first set of experiments considers the problem of having a simulated Raven II system [5] suture two flaps of tissue together. A second set of experiments considers a PR2 robot performing sutures in a scaled-up experimental setup. The simulation experiments were fully autonomous. For the real-world experiments we provided human input to assist with the detection of landmarks to be fed into the registration algorithm. The success rate for learning from a single demonstration is high for moderate perturbations from the demonstration's initial conditions, and it gradually decreases for larger perturbations."
2950370,22736,23735,Long distance visual ground-based signaling for unmanned aerial vehicles,2016,"We present a long-range visual signal detection system that is suitable for an unmanned aerial vehicle to find an optical signal released at a desired landing site for the purposes of cargo delivery or rescue situations where radio signals or other communication systems are not available or the wind conditions at the landing site need to be signaled. The challenge here is to have a signal and detection system that works from long range (> 1000m) amongst ground clutter during various seasonal conditions on passive imagery. We use a smoke-grenade as a ground signal, which has the advantageous properties of being easy to carry by ground crews because of its light weight and small size, but when released has a long visual signaling range. We employ a camera system on the UAV with a visual texture feature extraction approach in a machine learning framework to classify image patches as ‘signal’ or ‘background’. We study conventional approaches and develop a visual feature descriptor that can better differentiate the appearance of the visual signal under varying conditions and, when used to train a random-forest classifier, outperforms commonly used feature descriptors. The system was rigorously and quantitatively evaluated on data collected from a camera mounted on a helicopter and flown towards a plume of signal smoke over a variety of seasons, ground conditions, weather conditions, and environments. Our system was capable of detecting the smoke cloud with both precision and recall rates greater than 0.95 from ranges between 1000m and 1500m. Further, we develop a method to estimate wind orientation and approximate wind strength by assessing the shape of the smoke signal. We present a preliminary evaluation of the wind estimation in conditions with different wind intensities and orientations relative to the approach direction."
2050119,22736,23735,Environmental Exploration Based On A Three-dimensional Imaging Radar Sensor,1992,"Well-known sensors applied for remote sensing tasks in the field of autonomous mobile robots are active range discriminating optical and acoustical devices (e.g. laser range cameras, ultrasonic sensors) and passive sensors like CCD-cameras. Regarding the frequency domain they use, we see that, excluding the acoustic devices, they cover the range from about 400 nm to 1500 nm (visual and infrared region). In this paper we present an alternative multitask radar imaging sensor with high spatial resolution operating at a wavelength of 3 mm, corresponding to a frequency of 94 GHz, especially designed for sensing 3-D geometrical properties of an autonomous vehicle environment in indoor situations. The main features of this imaging radar sensor approach are a broad field of vision, direct access to range and velocity information via Doppler signal processing. This is achieved by implementing a coherent pulse doppler radar principle. A short introduction of the system design and technical parameters is given first. Then we concentrate on the sensors various operating modes (e.g. scanning, tracking, 3-D imaging, map generation) proved by presentation of several radar images and different kind of maps we obtained in laboratory surroundings as well as fabrication plants. On the basis of the radar maps an impression of typical millimeter-wave scattering phenomena is given. Finally we discuss the quality of the preprocessed radar data and the contribution of this microwave imaging device within a multisensor environment which is built up in the joint research project SFB 331 at our university."
1955499,22736,23735,Grounded Situation Models for Robots: Where words and percepts meet,2006,"Our long-term objective is to develop robots that engage in natural language-mediated cooperative tasks with humans. To support this goal, we are developing an amodal representation and associated processes which is called a grounded situation model (GSM). We are also developing a modular architecture in which the GSM resides in a centrally located module, around which there are language, perception, and action-related modules. The GSM acts as a sensor-updated structured blackboard, that serves as a workspace with contents similar to a theatrical stage in the robot's mind, which might be filled in with present, past or imagined situations. Two main desiderata drive the design of the GSM: first, parsing situations into ontological types and relations that reflect human language semantics, and second, allowing bidirectional translation between sensory-derived data/expectations and linguistic descriptions. We present an implemented system that allows of a range of conversational and assistive behavior by a manipulator robot. The robot updates beliefs (held in the GSM) about its physical environment, the human user, and itself, based on a mixture of linguistic, visual and proprioceptive evidence. It can answer basic questions about the present or past and also perform actions through verbal interaction. Most importantly, a novel contribution of our approach is the robot's ability for seamless integration of both language- and sensor-derived information about the situation: for example, the system can acquire parts of situations either by seeing them or by imagining them through descriptions given by the user: There is a red ball at the left. These situations can later be used to create mental imagery and sensory expectations, thus enabling the aforementioned bidirectionality"
2018307,22736,23735,Dynamic emergence and adaptation of behavior through embodiment as coupled chaotic field,2004,"A novel model for dynamic emergence and adaptation of embodied behavior is proposed. A musculo-skeletal system is controlled by a number of chaotic elements, each of which driving a muscle based on local sensory feedback. Thus, the chaotic elements interact with each other through the physical body and the environment. This overall structure is modelled as a coupled chaotic system, which has been known in the complex systems science for its capability of creating and moving among extremely rich variety of ordered patterns. In our model, body-environment interaction dynamics, or embodiment, serves as the chaos coupling field, which is nonlinear and time-varying. Theoretically very little is known about such cases, but since the coupling field directly reflects the current body-environment dynamics, we believe that the emergent ordered patterns correspond to useful motor coordination patterns which immediately get reorganized in response to dynamically changing environmental situation. We implemented the above model and carried out a series of experiments using a dynamics simulator. The results confirmed the above conjecture. In a muscle-joint model and a multi-legged insect model, the systems autonomously explored and found meaningful motor behaviors within a few seconds. And when the environmental condition changes they immediately created novel motor patterns, which comply with the new situation. Unlike existing learning methods, our model does not require long training period or well designed reward function. The emergence and adaptation takes place immediately, and yet effective in the current embodied situation. Furthermore, we present a methodology to introduce goal-directedness to the system without destroying its emergent property."
1054464,22736,23735,A miniature bio-inspired position sensing device for the control of micro-aerial robots,2012,"Here we present an example of a novel bio-inspired active vision system with a vibrating eye that can rotate freely by means of a miniature rotary piezo motor. Active micro-vibrations were applied to the eye by using an innovative micro-mechanism based on a tiny stepper motor. The hyperacuity of this inexpensive position-sensing device, which results from the active micro-vibrations, makes it capable of measuring the angular position of a contrasting edge. Among the many miniature rotary actuators available, piezomotors are often used when small size, low mass, great accuracy and high dynamics are required. The newly off-the-shelf miniature ultrasonic piezomotor presented in this study along with its position servo control system is supplied ready-integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB Piezomotor (or PCBMotor) has many advantages, such as high torque (it requires no reducer), fast dynamics (the mechanical time constant is 3ms), a low mass (1gram) and a compact size (it is only 20mm in diameter and 2.6mm thick). The results of the tests conducted show that the performances of the PCBmotor connected to a custom-made miniature electronic driver make it a good alternative to the actuators classically used in robotic applications. In addition we present a simple visual processing, implemented onto a tiny microcontroller, composed of simple linear filtering and arithmetic operations. We show that our visual scanning sensor is a genuine position sensing device able to measure the relative angular position of a visual object with only two pixels and very few computational resources."
2606463,22736,23735,Combining tactile sensing and vision for rapid haptic mapping,2015,"We consider the problem of enabling a robot to efficiently obtain a dense haptic map of its visible surroundings using the complementary properties of vision and tactile sensing. Our approach assumes that visible surfaces that look similar to one another are likely to have similar haptic properties. We present an iterative algorithm that enables a robot to infer dense haptic labels across visible surfaces when given a color-plus-depth (RGB-D) image along with a sequence of sparse haptic labels representative of what could be obtained via tactile sensing. Our method uses a color-based similarity measure and connected components on color and depth data. We evaluated our method using several publicly available RGBD image datasets with indoor cluttered scenes pertinent to robot manipulation. We analyzed the effects of algorithm parameters and environment variation, specifically the level of clutter and the type of setting, like a shelf, table top, or sink area. In these trials, the visible surface for each object consisted of an average of 8602 pixels, and we provided the algorithm with a sequence of haptically-labeled pixels up to a maximum of 40 times the number of objects in the image. On average, our algorithm correctly assigned haptic labels to 76.02% of all of the object pixels in the image given this full sequence of labels. We also performed experiments with the humanoid robot DARCI reaching in a cluttered foliage environment while using our algorithm to create a haptic map. Doing so enabled the robot to reach goal locations using a single plan after a single greedy reach, while our previous tactile-only mapping method required 5 or more plans to reach each goal."
1590877,22736,23735,Gait optimization for roombots modular robots — Matching simulation and reality,2013,"The design of efficient locomotion gaits for robots with many degrees of freedom is challenging and time consuming even if optimization techniques are applied. Control parameters can be found through optimization in two ways: (i) through online optimization where the performance of a robot is measured while trying different control parameters on the actual hardware and (ii) through offline optimization by simulating the robot's behavior with the help of models of the robot and its environment. In this paper, we present a hybrid optimization method that combines the best properties of online and offline optimization to efficiently find locomotion gaits for arbitrary structures. In comparison to pure online optimization, both the number of experiments using robotic hardware as well as the total time required for finding efficient locomotion gaits get highly reduced by running the major part of the optimization process in simulation using a cluster of processors. The presented example shows that even for robots with a low number of degrees of freedom the time required for optimization can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 to 30, at least, depending on how extensive the search for optimized control parameters should be. Time for hardware experiments becomes minimal. More importantly, gaits that can possibly damage the robotic hardware can be filtered before being tried in hardware. Yet in contrast to pure offline optimization, we reach well matched behavior that allows a direct transfer of locomotion gaits from simulation to hardware. This is because through a meta-optimization we adapt not only the locomotion parameters but also the parameters for simulation models of the robot and environment allowing for a good matching of the robot behavior in simulation and hardware. We validate the proposed hybrid optimization method on a structure composed of two Roombots modules with a total number of six degrees of freedom. Roombots are self-reconfigurable modular robots that can form arbitrary structures with many degrees of freedom through an integrated active connection mechanism."
2138696,22736,23735,Generation of Large Gymnastic Motions for a Family of Under-Actuated Robots by Zero-Moment-Manifold Control,2006,"This paper is concerned with a novel control method to generate any desired motion for a family of under-actuated robots such as gymnastics robots and acrobots having a single lower leg pivoted at the floor. This pivotal ankle joint can not be actuator-driven but may have only a passive viscous device such as a rotary damper. Therefore these robots are intrinsically unstable under the effect of gravity. In order to maneuver such an under-actuated robot with n joints under non-holonomic constraint without loosing stability of motion, we have proposed a zero moment manifold (ZMM) control method by introducing an (n - 1)-dimensional configuration manifold, on which a set of joint angle vectors satisfies zero of the rotational moment around the ankle joint. It could be shown theoretically that any motion starting from any initial posture on a subset of the ZMM and moving to a desired posture can be stabilized by using a coordinated control composed of gravity compensation and PD feedback. Though the theoretical proof can guarantee only stability of movements of joint angles in a narrow range, it has been observed that the robot can move in a wider range through preliminary numerical simulation results. Notwithstanding such a conservative result of theory, this paper shows that the ZMM control with constant PD gains can generate global gymnastics movements for a class of under-actuated robots by verifying through a variety of numerical simulations that most of given attractors (target postures) have corresponding large attraction regions. This is also verified experimentally by using a real gymnastics robot with four joints and a series of large movements can be produced consecutively as programmed by selecting several target postures enough separated each other and combining them"
2919437,22736,23735,Large-scale 3D scene reconstruction with Hilbert Maps,2016,"3D scene reconstruction involves the volumetric modeling of space, and it is a fundamental step in a wide variety of robotic applications, including grasping, obstacle avoidance, path planning, mapping and many others. Nowadays, sensors are able to quickly collect vast amounts of data, and the challenge has become one of storing and processing all this information in a timely manner, especially if real-time performance is required. Recently, a novel technique for the stochastic learning of discriminative models through continuous occupancy maps was proposed: Hilbert Maps [18], that is able to represent the input space at an arbitrary resolution while capturing statistical relationships between measurements. The original framework was proposed for 2D environments, and here we extend it to higher-dimensional spaces, addressing some of the challenges brought by the curse of dimensionality. Namely, we propose a method for the automatic selection of feature coordinate locations, and introduce the concept of localized automatic relevance determination (LARD) to the Hilbert Maps framework, in which different dimensions in the projected Hilbert space operate within independent length-scale values. The proposed technique was tested against other state-of-the-art 3D scene reconstruction tools in three different datasets: a simulated indoors environment, RIEGL laser scans and dense LSD-SLAM pointclouds. The results testify to the proposed framework's ability to model complex structures and correctly interpolate over unobserved areas of the input space while achieving real-time training and querying performances."
669604,22736,23735,trulla : An Algorithm For Path Planning Among Weighted Regions By Localized Propagations,1992,"This paper discusses an approach to mo- bile robot path planning which utilizes a wavefront- like propagation method for determining near-optimal paths. This approach is different from previous wave propagation methods in three aspects: it attempts to find near-optimal paths from all locations in the free space to the destination instead of one optimal path from the source location to the destination, may per- form repeated propagations to converge to a solution, and is composed of simplified computations based on local information to facilitate a VLSI implementation. I. INTRODUCTION Wavefront propagation methods for robot path plan- ning have been proposed by other researchers. The tradi- tional approach is to start with a list containing only the destination point (or a region representing a small area around the destination point) and propagate a value rep- resenting the cost of traveling between the two regions to each unvisited neighbor of the region. The region is removed from the list and all its newly visited neighbors are added to the list. The list is sorted by increasing cost and the process is repeated with the lowest cost region in the list. This process terminates when the source region is reached. The actual path is then constructed between the endpoints using the computed cost values. Jahanbin and Fallside(l) have presented some wavefront propagation path planning algorithms consisting only of free-space and obstacles in configuration space. They pre- sented two solutions to the planning problem, one for uniform region sizes and another for non-uniform region sizes. The propagation was performed by the use of a mask which was placed over successive positions on the wavefront. Various shape wavefronts could be propagated depending on the weights in the mask. Once the propa- gation was completed the path was constructed from the source to the lowest cost neighbor and this process was repeated until the destination was reached. There are two"
2431097,22736,23735,Computing 3d Road Shape From Images For A Challenge To An ill-posed Problem,1989,"A new algorithm is presented for reconstructing the 3D road shape from camera images for the purpose of navigating auto- nomous land vehicles (ALVs). The approximation that the road sur- face is locally flat enables us to determine a one-to-one correspon- dence between the two road boundaries, which in tum determines the 3D road shape. In order to cope with inaccuracy of image data, a least-square curve fitting technique is proposed with error behaviors taken into account. Examples based on real images are shown, and the role of heuristics is discussed. et al. (15) proposed a parametric fitting approach by preparing several prototypes of the 3D road shape. Kanatani, et al. 181 proposed a differential approach, describing the constraints that ideal roads should satisfy in terms of differential equations and reconstructing the 3D road shape by numerically integrating them. The solution is very robust to noise even in the distant part of the road. The discrete approach of DeMenthon (3) and the differential approach of Kanatani, et al. (8) both suffer the same problem: Computational error grows rapidly in the course of reconstruc- tion due to inaccuracy of the original image data and approxi- mations involved in the scheme. Recently, DeMenthon 141 pro- posed a new scheme based on the assumption that the road is locally Jrat and showed that the solution can be determined point-wise. As a result, one part of the solution is not affected by the error involved in other parts of the solution. At the same time, however, this local determination destroys the global consistency of the solution; locally constructed solutions can be inconsistent with each other. DeMenthon (6) proposed the use of dynamic programming to search for a globally consistent solution, but there is no guarantee that such a solution exists. In this paper, we incorporate the viewpoint of projective"
2638541,22736,23735,Multi-robot 6D graph SLAM connecting decoupled local reference filters,2015,"Teams of mobile robots can be deployed in search and rescue missions to explore previously unknown environments. Methods for joint localization and mapping constitute the basis for (semi-)autonomous cooperative action, in particular when navigating in GPS-denied areas. As communication losses may occur, a decentralized solution is required. With these challenges in mind, we designed a submap-based SLAM system that relies on inertial measurements and stereo-vision to create multi-robot dense 3D maps. For online pose and map estimation, we integrate the results of keyframe-based local reference filters through incremental graph SLAM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine these two methods to benefit from their particular advantages for 6D multi-robot localization and mapping: Local reference filters on each robot provide real-time, long-term stable state estimates that are required for stabilization, control and fast obstacle avoidance, whereas online graph optimization provides global multi-robot pose and map estimates needed for cooperative planning. We propose a novel graph topology for a decoupled integration of local filter estimates from multiple robots into a SLAM graph according to the filters' uncertainty estimates and independence assumptions and evaluated its benefits on two different robots in indoor, outdoor and mixed scenarios. Further, we performed two extended experiments in a multi-robot setup to evaluate the full SLAM system, including visual robot detections and submap matches as inter-robot loop closure constraints."
1870292,22736,23735,Action planner of hybrid leg-wheel robots for lunar and planetary exploration,2008,"In this paper, we propose an action planning algorithm and its evaluation method based on dynamic simulation for a novel type of hybrid leg-wheel rover for planetary exploration. Hybrid leg-wheel robots are recently receiving a growing interest from the space community to explore planets, since they offer an appropriate solution to gain improved speed and mobility on unstructured terrain. However, in order to fully reach the hybrid mechanismpsilas potential, it is necessary to establish an optimal way to define when to use one over the other locomotion mode, depending on the soil conditions and topology. Even though this step is crucial, little attention has been devoted to this topic by the robotic community. The switching of motion mode, that is either wheel or leg are the actions to be planned, that we are considering in this paper. We aim at generating the safest and the least energy demanding path to reach a point of scientific interest. In order to define the optimal path with the set of switching actions required for the robot to follow it, the authors developed an action planning algorithm and a path evaluation method based on a four steps approach. First, an optimal candidate path on a rough terrain is generated based on topology and specificationspsila criteria functions. Then switching actions are defined along this path depending on the hybrid robotpsilas performances in each motion mode. The next step is a dynamic simulation of the robot controlled to follow the path. Finally, the path is evaluated based on the energy profile spent by the actuators and calculated by the simulation. Demonstrations for the proposed technique are addressed along with a discussion on characteristics of the candidate path and the energy profile of the robot."

ACTRESS is composed of multiple robotic agents. Each robotic agent is called robotor. A robotor may be a robot, a computing system and any other equip- ments. While researching in this field, many research issues need to have solutions, such issues may include, the communication among the agents and protocols, cooperation among a group of agents, describing the tasks to be executed, multi-agent motion planning, multi-agent task planning, task description, human interface role, solving deadlocks ... etc. The aim of this paper is to develop a simulation environment for an autonomous and decentralized multi-agent robotic system. For this purpose, it is neces- sary to simulate and analyze the main functions of each agent, design and analysis of the actions to be carried out by each agent, analyzing their real time behavior with a variety of situations considering their environ- ment and the treatment of unexpected events. Also, it is aecessary to find out an efficient strategy to realize effective means for the agents to form a cooperating manner that support task execution and problem solv- ing. In parallel with the mentioned purposes the ACTRESS structure is simulated as functions and behavior using the developed simulation environment. This simulation includes a group of mobile robots, human interface and global environment manager. Then, software integration that deal with various aspect of the overall problem is developed.

2921104,22736,23735,Runtime SES planning: Online motion planning in environments with stochastic dynamics and uncertainty,2016,"Motion planning in stochastic dynamic uncertain environments is critical in several applications such as human interacting robots, autonomous vehicles and assistive robots. In order to address these complex applications, several methods have been developed. The most successful methods often predict future obstacle locations in order identify collision-free paths. Since prediction can be computationally expensive, offline computations are commonly used, and simplifications such as the inability to consider the dynamics of interacting obstacles or possible stochastic dynamics are often applied. Online methods can be preferable to simulate potential obstacle interactions, but recent methods have been restricted to Gaussian interaction processes and uncertainty. In this paper we present an online motion planning method, Runtime Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (Runtime SES) planning, an inexpensive method for predicting obstacle motion with generic stochastic dynamics while maintaining a high planning success rate despite the potential presence of obstacle position error. Runtime SES planning evaluates the likelihood of collision for any state-time coordinate around the robot by performing Monte Carlo simulations online. This prediction is used to construct a customized Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) in order to quickly identify paths that avoid obstacles while moving toward a goal. We demonstrate Runtime SES planning in problems that benefit from online predictions, environments with strongly-interacting obstacles with stochastic dynamics and positional error. Through experiments that explore the impact of various parametrizations, robot dynamics and obstacle interaction models, we show that real-time capable planning with a high success rate is achievable in several complex environments."
950946,22736,23735,Bio-inspired hovering control for an aerial robot equipped with a decoupled eye and a rate gyro,2012,"Hovering flies are capable of achieving outstanding performances when hovering above flowers for several minutes. A new insect-based hovering control strategy is presented here for accurately stabilizing the position of a sighted twin-rotor equipped with a decoupled eye with a narrow field-of-view of only a few degrees. The main aim of this paper is to describe how accurately hovering flight above a target can be achieved by means of this fundamental bio-inspired mechanical decoupling system between the eye and the body. The simulated gaze control system implemented on-board the aerial robot has several advantages : — it enables the robot's gaze to be stabilized on the basis of three bio-inspired oculomotor reflexes (ORs) : a visual fixation reflex (VFR), a translational reflex and a rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR and rVOR), — it makes the eye compensate quickly and accurately for any sudden, untoward disturbances caused by the vagaries of the supporting head or body, — it provides a reference visual signal to compensate for the rate gyro drift used to implement the VORs and to stabilize the hovering robot, — it greatly improves the stability of the robot's roll during voluntary lateral displacements with respect to the target. Close comparisons were made between two simulated robots with and without a decoupled eye, which were both subjected to strong lateral and roll disturbances. The simulations show that the robot with a decoupled eye can reject disturbances twice as fast as that with a fixed eye. This innovative bio-inspired hovering control method stabilizes the robot's attitude without any need for accelerometers, magnetometers or classical inertial measurement units."
1978326,22736,23735,High-speed Image Processor For The Extraction Of 3-D Depth Information From Image Sequence,1992,"Abstmc& This paper presents a real time image processor for obtaining three-dimensional (3-D) distance information from image sequence caused by a moving area sensor or multiple fixed area sensors. The processor has been developed for an automated visual inspection robot system (pilot system) with an autonomous vehicle which moves around avoiding obstacles in a power plant and checks whether there are defects or abnormal phenomena such as steam leakage from valves. The processor detects the distance between objects in the input image and the area sensor, deciding corresponding points(pixe1s) between the first input image and the last one by tracing the loci of edges through the sequence of sixteen images. The hardware which plays an important role is two kinds of boards: mapping board which can transform Xcoordinate (horizontal direction) and Y-coordinate (vertical direction) for every horizontal row of images, and a regional labelling board which extracts the connected loci of edges through image sequence. This paper also shows the whole processing flow of the distance detection algorithm. Since the processor can continuously process images (5 12x5 12x8 pixels *bits per frame) at the NTSC video rate, it takes about 0.7 s to measure the 3-D distance by sixteen input images. From our experimental results for indoor scene up to now, when the area sensor laterally moves the range of 20 centimeters and when the object to be measured is at a distance of 4 meters from the sensor, the error rate of the measurement is approximately 3 percent (if the scene is clear and simple), and maximum 10 percent (if the scene includes a complicated background)."
1676594,22736,23735,"Unfreezing the robot: Navigation in dense, interacting crowds",2010,"In this paper, we study the safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents with uncertain trajectories. Existing algorithms suffer from the “freezing robot” problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in “joint collision avoidance”: They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably."
2968250,22736,23735,Compliant control for soft robots: Emergent behavior of a tendon driven anthropomorphic arm,2016,"With the accelerated development of robot technologies, optimal control becomes one of the central themes of research. In traditional approaches, the controller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the basis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions, objectives, learning schemes, and so forth. While very successful with classical robots, these methods run into severe difficulties when applied to soft robots, a new field of robotics with large interest for human-robot interaction. We claim that a novel controller paradigm opens new perspective for this field. This paper applies a recently developed neuro controller with differential extrinsic synaptic plasticity to a muscle-tendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit. In the experiments, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when left alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses. By applying physical forces, the system can be entrained into definite motion patterns like wiping a table. Most interestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional resonance with the object's internal dynamics, starting to shake spontaneously bottles half-filled with water or sensitively driving an attached pendulum into a circular mode. When attached to the crank of a wheel the neural system independently develops to rotate it. In this way, the robot discovers affordances of objects its body is interacting with."
2493149,22736,23735,Do I Need A Robot Or A Nonrobot Automated System,1992,"In manufacturing automation, the current focus is on integration at enterprise level. This however has not reduced the need for automation on the shopfloor. On the contrary, the latter has become more pressing. On the shopfloor, major manufacturing costs are related to handling and assembly operations. Difficulties in automating those operations are twofold. First, there is usually a line beyond which manual operation remains the most economical solution today. And then for each application, the proper level of#N#sophistication in terms of automation technology should be adopted. The paper concentrates on the second difficulty. Most often, products and processes can be designed so as to require fairly simple automated systems for their manufacturing (on/off devices, programmable logic controllers, independent actuators, etc.). But when the application#N#features significant position and/or orientation uncertainties (mathematical space of dimension 3 or more), some kind of perception is required to cope with them, and this usually results in adaptive workpiece or tool trajectories. Robotics provide unmatched solutions for such multi-dimensional, coordinated motions. General guidelines are introduced in order t o select the appropriate type of component for automation. Then, two case studies follow. In both cases, the application is complex, in terms of parameter variability. Many examples are given of correspondence between given guidelines and concrete, low-level details. In particular, while in the first case automated solutions can be devised with traditional, multiple independent servoed motions and general-purpose computers, in the second one, industrial robotics with dedicated controllers provide the right answer."
1196360,22736,23735,Automatic gait generation in modular robots: “to oscillate or to rotate; that is the question”,2010,"Modular robots offer the possibility to quickly design robots with a high diversity of shapes and functionalities. This nice feature also brings an important challenge: namely how to design efficient locomotion gaits for arbitrary robot structures with many degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a framework that allows one to explore and identify highly different gaits for a given arbitrary-shaped modular robot. We use simulated robots made of several Roombots modules that have three degrees of freedom each. These modules have the interesting feature that they can produce both oscillatory movements (i.e. periodic movements around a rest position) and rotational movements (i.e. with continuously increasing angle), leading to rich locomotion patterns. Here we ask ourselves which types of movements — purely oscillatory, purely rotational, or a combination of both— lead to the fastest gaits. To address this question we designed a control architecture based on a distributed system of coupled phase oscillators that can produce synchronized rotations and oscillations in many degrees of freedom. We also designed a specific optimization algorithm that can automatically design hybrid controllers, i.e. controllers that use oscillations in some joints and rotations in others. The proposed framework is verified by multiple simulations for several robot morphologies. The results show that (i) the question whether it is better to oscillate or to rotate depends on the morphology of the robot, and that in general it is best to do both, (ii) the optimization framework can successfully generate hybrid controllers that outperform purely oscillatory and purely rotational ones, and (iii) the resulting gaits are fast, innovative, and would have been hard to design by hand."
2296658,22736,23735,Proto-symbol emergence,2000,"Robotics can serve as a testbed for cognitive theories. One behavioral criterion for comparing theories is the extent to which their implementations can learn to exploit new environmental opportunities. Furthermore, a robotics testbed forces researchers to confront fundamental issues concerning how internal representations are grounded in activity. In our approach, a mobile robot takes the role of a creature that must survive in an unknown environment. The robot has no a priori knowledge about what constitutes a suitable goal, what is edible, inedible, or dangerous, or even its shape or how its body works. Nevertheless, the robot learns how to survive. The robot does this by tracking segmented regions of its camera image while moving. The robot projects these regions into a canonical wavelet domain that highlights color and intensity changes at various scales. This reveals sensory invariance that is readily extracted with Bayesian statistics. The robot simultaneously learns an adaptable sensorimotor mapping by recording how motor signals transform the locations of regions on its camera image. The robot learns about its own physical extension when it touches an object, but it also undergoes an internal state change analogous to the thirst quenching or nausea producing effects of intake in animals. This allows the robot to learn what an object affords: is it edible or poisonous, by relating these effects to learned clusters of invariance. In this way primitive symbols emerge. These proto-symbols provide the robot with goals that it can achieve by using its sensorimotor mapping to navigate, for example, toward food and away from danger."
2968075,22736,23735,Detection of multi-biosignal using a quartz crystal resonator based wide range load sensor with compact frequency counter,2016,"Monitoring of biosignals plays important roles in health management in daily life. Especially, the sensing method of biosignals, which does not require special efforts such as restraining people or wearing the sensors to measure them, is really important to maintain monitoring activities of people. We call such method what a sensing way should be for monitoring of biosignals as casual sensing methods. Previously, we have developed highly sensitive and wide-measurement-range load sensors based on measuring frequency shift of quartz crystal resonator (QCR) as the sensing principal. We have integrated the load sensor into a chair, and measure the load when people just sit on it. Since the load sensor has wide measurement range of 10 5  order, multi-biosignal; heartbeat, respiration, and body motion under the weight-loaded environment can be measured from load information. Thus, people can casually monitor the biosignals by sitting on the chair. However, the previous sensing system required us to measure the frequency shift of one-Hz order in tens-MHz of the resonant frequency of a QCR. In this case, the sensing system requires a expensive frequency counter, and it is not suitable for daily use situation such as in-home sensing. In this paper, we presents the detection of multi-biosignal method using a newly developed load sensing system which utilizes the developed frequency counter unit. In order to measure the frequency shift of one-Hz order in tens-MHz of the resonant frequency, we use a differential method of signal for two QCRs with an electrical signal-mixing circuit. By using the method, we can reduce the required measurement range for frequency from tens-MHz to tens-kHz. The load sensing performances were evaluated, and the results showed that the sensitivity and withstand load were 2.9 [mN] and 300 [N], respectively. Finally, we demonstrated the measurement of multi-biosignal by using constructed system, and succeeded in detecting respiration, heartbeat, and body motion."
2948656,22736,23735,Visuo-haptic transmission of contact information improve operation of Active Scope Camera,2016,"Disaster response robots for searching in a narrow area have limited space to mount tactile sensors, but the operators require sensory feedback to recognize contact situations with the surrounding environment. This study proposes a new approach to transmitting contact information of a remote-operated snake-like robot called Active Scope Camera (ASC) to the operator using simple configurations for the sensing and display methods. For the sensing side, we develop a contact estimation method with a limited number of tactile sensors. We establish the method to localize the contact position and the magnitude by sensing multiple propagated vibrations based on experiments and formulations. Preliminary experiments show that the developed method estimates a collision angle with high probability (93.8% at the worst condition) at several collisional situations. For the display side, we combine visual and vibrotactile feedback to provide the operator both directional and temporal cues to perceive contact events. The proposed visualization method uses colored bars, peripherally superposed on the video image, to show the estimated contact location and magnitude. A single DoF vibrotactile feedback is used for a joystick interface to control the head movement of the ASC. The effect of vibrotactile feedback on the response time to contact events is evaluated. Finally, we investigate the performance of the operation by identifying the contact behavior at simulated scenarios. Experimental results show that collision times per operation time is decreased by the developed feedback system compared with a simple video-based operation."
2310239,22736,23735,Task Level Programming And Robot Autonomy,1992,"We consider the class of intervention mobile robots that huve to perform tasks in ill-known environments which are often remote or of difflicult or dangerous access. An outstanding example of this would be a Mars Rover designed to carry out planet exploration, scientific measurements and experiments, according lo the requeslis of Earth based scientists over a long period of time, e.g. one Martian year. The lack of structure in the environment of this class of intervention robots, as well as the nonrepetitive nature of the tasks, clearly require eficient task programming and constant adaptation to the environment by the robot. We contend that this class of problems demands a specific decisional architecture which couples “intelligence” at the programming level with “intelligence” at the level of the physical machine. This second requirement implies that the machine exhibits the attributes of an autonomous intelligent robot. In this paper we develop the concepts of a generic architecture aimed to achieve task control of a remote intervention robot. The robot is fully autonomous at task level. It receives tasks assignements that it transforms into sequences of actions using ats own interpretation and planning capacities, and executes these actions while being ,reactive to asynchronous events and environment conditions. We have developed the approach presented here in the context of several domain-oriented projects, and fully implemented a first version of the concepts in our newest mobile robot, HILARE II. The framework of the french Mars Rover project VAP is used as an illustration of some crucial aspects discussed in the paper."
1839925,22736,23735,Development of assisted-robotic system designed to measure the Wave Intensity with an ultrasonic diagnostic device,2009,"In recent years, due to the increasing rate of elderly people in Japan, the needs to detect adults' diseases at the early stage becomes a high priority. In particular, an increased interest in detecting heart and cerebrovascular diseases at an early stage may allow clinicians to begin treatment sooner, when interventions are generally more effective and less expensive. Recently, the Wave Intensity (WI) has been proposed as a new hemodynamic index that provides information about the dynamic behavior of the heart and the vascular system and their interaction. However; the repetitiveness and accuracy of the WI measurement depend on the precision of the positioning of the ultrasound probe. Therefore a positioning device for ultrasound probe is required. Such a device should not only be used to keep the position but also for the fine positioning of the probe. For this purpose, at Waseda University, we have proposed the development of a robot system to assist a carotid blood flow measurement using ultrasound diagnostic equipments. In this paper, the development of Waseda-Tokyo Women's Medical-Aloka Blood Flow Measurement System No. 1 Refined II (WTA-1RII) is detailed. The system consists of an ultrasound diagnostic device, a 6-DOFs parallel link manipulator, a serial link passive arm, ball joint, and a joystick type controller. The WTA-1RII has improved the design of the gravity compensation mechanism. In addition, a genetic algorithm has by implemented to determine the optimal link's position of the 6-DOFs parallel manipulator to increase the workspace. Finally, a set of experiments were carried out to determine the usability of the proposed system."
751728,22736,23735,Multi-cost Robotic Motion Planning Under Uncertainty,2014,"This paper describes an algorithm for robotic motion planning that is capable of optimising several cost functions simultaneously to provide optimised, feasible and collision-free paths. The algorithm is based on the best-first graph search algorithm using a Pareto frontier to evaluate costs at each node. Additionally, we include a calculation of the distribution of robot trajectories when the path is realised using a LQR based controller. This ensures that the possibility of collisions is greatly reduced. Results are provided that show multi-cost robotic path planning under position uncertainty and control constraints whilst simultaneously optimising distance travelled and fuel spent. I. INTRODUCTION When creating a motion plan for a robotic vehicle, it is desirable to choose the shortest path to ensure quick execution of the mission. It is also desirable to ensure the vehicle can localise itself with enough precision such that it does not collide with objects in the environment. To achieve this, the vehicle may have to deviate from the obvious shortest path solution. For example, a robot may need to move into open space to obtain a good GPS fix. Furthermore, a robot may have other constraints such as the fuel remaining, shock loading, weather conditions or daylight available that could have an impact on it completing the mission. It is therefore necessary to optimise a motion plan that considers all mission constraints as costs. We therefore propose that a multi-dimensional cost function is required to generate feasible and optimised paths for robotic vehicles to maximise the mission success. Robotic path planning research has traditionally focussed"
919800,22736,23735,A mechatronic system for in-plane ground-reaction-force measurement for tremor analysis in animal models,2005,"Movement and behavior analysis is a key research area in the domain of biomedical engineering and in many other medical research domains aiming at the understanding of physiological motor and cognitive basic mechanisms. The systematic application of robotic and mechatronic technologies to realize new tools and measurement methods for quantitatively assessing motor and cognitive functions in humans as well as in animal models is gaining an increasing popularity. This work represents a first step towards the development of a sensorised environment for behavioral phenotyping of animal models. In particular, this paper focuses on tremor analysis in reeler mice, an emerging potential animal model for anatomical and behavioral traits observed in autism. Ground reaction force (GRF) sensing is indeed the most direct means of measuring tremor. Although force platforms have extensively been used for large size animals, only few attempts have been made to measure GRF at a single paw for animals as small as mice or rats. Under the hypothesis that in-plane GRF components are directly connected to tremor, a small size, low-cost, 2-axis force sensor for measuring the in-plane components of GRF was designed and developed. Special care was paid to design a structure that would allow self-aligned assembly, for repeatability, and modularity for combining multiple platforms for a sensorised floor. Preliminarily testing was performed with both reeler and wildtype mice. Fourier analysis was deployed to extract information due to tremor, validating the hypothesis of a direct connection between tremor and in-plane GRFs."
2606525,22736,23735,SpineMan: Design of a soft robotic spine-like manipulator for safe human-robot interaction,2015,"Robots made from soft materials have recently captured the interest of researchers from a range of fields including engineers, material scientists, and chemists, biologists, and computer scientists. This new paradigm of soft robotics aims to develop more adaptable, more capable and safer robots that can interact with unstructured environments or permit close cooperation with humans. Current, commercially-available solutions in industrial robotics tend to take a software-centered approach to safe human-robot interaction or focus on the design of lightweight structures consisting of conventional rigid materials. Even though these solutions provide a higher safety level than traditional industrial robots, robots that comprise a sufficiently large amount of soft structures will bring about a certain degree of inherent safety. One of the major challenges in today's soft robotics research is to design robots that are inherently safe and adaptable but are also capable of bearing limited loads. Nature has solved this predicament in larger animals by incorporating stiff endoskeletons, which support the weight of the otherwise predominantly soft bodies. This insight has led to the development of a novel spine-like manipulator (SpineMan) comprised of rigid elements made from polypropylene and soft elements consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) borax hydrogels that are enveloped in a silicone skin. The initial design, material selection, synthesis, and characterization of this robot are presented in this article."

2848266,22736,23836,Parameterizable FPGA-Based Kalman Filter Coprocessor Using Piecewise Affine Modeling,2016,"The Kalman Filter is a robust tool often employed as a plant observer in control systems. However, in the general case the high computational cost, especially for large system models or fast sample rates, makes it an impractical choice for typical low-power microcontrollers. Industry trends towards tighter integration and subsystem consolidation point to the use of powerful high-end SoCs, but this complicates the ability for a controls engineer to verify correct behavior of the system under all conditions, which is important in safety-critical systems. Dedicated FPGA hardware can provide computational speedup, in addition to firmer design partitioning in mixed-criticality systems and fully deterministic timing, which helps ensure a control system behaves as close as possible to offline simulations. We introduce and compare two variants of a software-configurable FPGA-based implementation of a Kalman Filter. The first is an implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter, while the second is a novel approach -- the Piecewise-Affine Kalman Filter -- which may offer significant advantages for certain types of applications. The state estimate update time and resource requirements are analyzed for plant models up to 28 states. For large models, the designs provide a speedup of 7-12x compared to reference ARM9020T software implementations. An application-agnostic performance analysis demonstrates how the Piecewise-Affine Kalman Filter reduces the software workload and the communication overhead compared to the standard mixed hardware-software Extended Kalman Filter approach."
1895249,22736,23735,Technology For Dexterous Remote Manipulation,1992,"Remote manipulation of objects can provide for safer construction and operations in extreme environments such as space, underwater, and disaster areas. For manipulation of objects designed for human use such as levers, handles, knobs, and so forth, a dexterous hand is desirable. Robots can be operated in remote locations as telerobots with supervision by the human operator but with a certain degree of local autonomy. This requires some intelligence at the remote site. We describe recent work related to intelligent grasping by a dexterous mechanical hand. In order to provide robot hands with intelligence required for effective multifingered grasping, a strategy of grasp reasoning is being developed to plan the grasp so that the fingers will be guaranteed to firmly grasp the object during handling and generate fine motion to perform tasks using the same planned grasp points. Grasp planning strategies based upon heuristic experiences from the motions of human hands and fingers may experience difficulties when applied to the grasp of mechanical hands and fingers due to lack of precise sensing devices. This paper proposes a planned strategy for grasping based on mechanics principles and codes the grasp mechanics into an expert system which has been applied in graphic simulation. This system can be used to reason and make decisions of grasp points on any polygonal object. This strategy has the advantages of being intelligence based and computationally efficient without sacrificing the physics of the grasp. The method will be useful in real-time applications of sophisticated robot hands by reducing the complexity both in planning and control. This system cm have applications to the grasping of objects for construction and operation by mechanical hands with semi-autonomous operations in extreme environments."
2561467,22736,23735,An optimized field function scheme for nanoparticle guidance in magnetic drug targeting systems,2015,"Magnetic drug targeting is an approach to guide and concentrate magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) into the diseased target organ after being injected into blood vessels. Although many works for drug targeting have been conducted, there are few studies on delivering the nanoparticles to the target region. Drug delivery performance has not been addressed sufficiently or fully. In this paper, we investigate the effect of dominant factors to MNPs delivery performance. Then, an optimized field function scheme with a pulsed magnetic actuation is proposed to significantly improve the MNPs guidance performance. With a specific condition of blood vessel size, particle size, and applied magnetic field, the optimized parameters of the field function are selected through extensive simulation studies. We find out that the optimal negative and positive time for the magnetic pulsed field mainly depends on the exit time for particles to reach the bifurcation and the critical time as the maximum time for them to reach the vessels wall, respectively. With the chosen parameters, we show that ratios of correctly guided particles in a Y-channel are reached to 100%. In addition, to minimize the power consumption, a modified field function (MFF) scheme is introduced. The MFF includes a no-power time, called zero-time, between the positive and negative time. It is shown that with the proposed MFF, the energy consumption and the heating problem of the actuator system can be significantly reduced. Therefore, the proposed guidance scheme for MNPs can overcome the sticking issue and maximize the guidance performance as well as reducing the power consumption. It should be noted that the MFF can be easily implement by programmable DC power supplies connected to electromagnetic coils."

ACROBAT system has been developed by the authors group which realizes mechanical coordination of wheel and steering motions for creating caster behaviors without computer calculations. A motion in the specific direction relative to a robot body is fully depends on the motion of a specific motor. This feature gives a robot designer to build an omnidirectional mobile robot propelled by active-casters with no redundant actuation with a simple control. A controller of the robot becomes as simple as that for omni-wheeled robotic bases. Namely 3DOF of the omnidirectional robot is controlled by three motors using a simple and constant kinematics. ACROBAT includes a unique dual-ball transmission to transmit traction power to rotate and orient a drive wheel with distributing velocity components to wheel and steering axes in an appropriate ratio. Therefore a sensor for measuring a wheel orientation and calculations for velocity distributions are totally removed from a conventional control system. To build an omnidirectional vehicle by ACROBAT, the significant feature is some multiple drive shafts can be driven by a common motor which realizes non-redundant actuation of the robotic platform. A kinematic model of the proposed robot with ACROBAT is analyzed and a mechanical condition for realizing a non-redundant actuation is derived. Based on the kinematic model and the mechanical condition, computer simulations of the mechanism are performed. A prototype two-wheeled robot with two ACROBATs is designed and built to verify the availability of the proposed system. In the experiments, the prototype robot shows successful omnidirectional motions with a simple and constant kinematics based control."

For example, 3D modeling of architectural structures or digital preservation of cultural heritages are typical applications for 3D laser scanning. Despite of the development of light-weight and high-speed laser scanners, however, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still a heavy burden for the widespread use of laser scanning. We have proposed a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots named CPS-SLAM, which consists of parent robots with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers. In this system, a large-scale 3D model can be acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on a parent robot from several positions determined precisely by the localization technique using multiple robots named Cooperative Positioning System, CPS. Therefore, this system enables to build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP. In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a quite precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops. This paper proposes an automatic planning technique of a laser measurement for CPS-SLAM. By planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure, it is possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment. Proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling. We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique."
2945961,22736,23735,Towards occupational health improvement in foundries through dense dust and pollution monitoring using a complementary approach with mobile and stationary sensing nodes,2016,"In industrial environments, such as metallurgic facilities, human operators are exposed to harsh conditions where ambient air is often polluted with quartz, dust, lead debris and toxic fumes. Constant exposure to respirable particles can cause irreversible health damages and thus it is of high interest for occupational health experts to monitor the air quality on a regular basis. However, current monitoring procedures are carried out sparsely, with data collected in single day campaigns limited to few measurement locations. In this paper we explore the use and present first experimental results of a novel heterogeneous approach that uses a mobile robot and a network of low cost sensing nodes. The proposed system aims to address the spatial and temporal limitations of current monitoring techniques. The mobile robot, along with standard localization and mapping algorithms, allows to produce short term, spatially dense representations of the environment where dust, gas, ambient temperature and airflow information can be modelled. The sensing nodes on the other hand, can collect temporally dense (and usually spatially sparse) information during long periods of time, allowing in this way to register for example, daily variations in the pollution levels. Using data collected with the proposed system in an steel foundry, we show that a heterogeneous approach provides dense spatio-temporal information that can be used to improve the working conditions in industrial facilities."
2561438,22736,23735,Feasibility study- novel optical soft tactile array sensing for minimally invasive surgery,2015,"The absence of touch of sense is a widely known drawback of robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This paper proposes a design of optic soft tactile arrays which is promising to be adapted for MIS. The proposed design consists of multiple soft material channels. Each channel is designed using the Bernoulli pipe structure to amplify the sensor's sensitivity through input and output diameter difference. A multi-core optic fiber cable and a camera are used to capture the change of light intensity caused by the contact forces applied onto the individual soft material channels. The proposed sensor has the following advantages: 1) making use of 3D printing and soft material casting, it is suitable for designing sensors with high density of tactile elements; 2) it also allows the sensor to be designed in an arbitrary shape to fit various MIS applications; 3) compared to other light-intensity based tactile sensor, it is easy to fabricate and miniaturize; it avoids the complexity of attaching reflectors to individual sensing elements; 4) it is immune to electromagnetic interference. In this paper, a prototype which has 3×3 tactile elements in an area of 9.5 × 11 mm 2  has been developed and test for feasibility study. Also, a noise-filtering algorithm is developed to reduce the imaging noise. Validation experiments were carried out and results show that the average measurable force range for a single tactile element is 0 to 1.622N with an average accuracy of 97%. The sensor has low crosstalk-to-signal ratio, 1.8% on average, and has no signal drift over time."
1859754,22736,23735,CoMutaR: A framework for multi-robot coordination and task allocation,2009,"In multi-robot systems, task allocation and coordination are two fundamental problems that share high synergy. Although multi-robot architectures typically separate them into distinct layers, relevant improvement may be expected from solutions that are able to concurrently handle them at the same “level”. This paper proposes a novel framework, called CoMutaR (Coalition formation based on Multitasking Robots), which is used for both tackle task distribution among teams of mobile robots, and to guarantee the coordination within the formed teams. Robot capabilities are modelled as actions, independent modules whose inputs do not depend on the robot that generated it. Solutions to tasks are devised as coalitions of actions, that can be spread amongst the available robots. We also define the concept of share-restricted resources, which are periodically checked and updated by the actions in the system. In contrast to prior approaches, this mechanism enables to quickly determine if two actions can be executed simultaneously, allowing a single robot to execute multiple tasks concurrently. A single-round auction protocol is used to automatically discover and form coalitions. Once a coalition is formed, coordination among robots is modelled as constraints imposed over the share-restricted resources. Finally, we have successfully implemented and applied CoMutaR in typical scenarios like object transportation, area surveillance, and multi-robot box pushing. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to provide good solutions even in the case of severe failures in participating robots."

These intricately efficient systems function independently, or coalesce with other cells in our bodies to produce higher-order intelligent functionalities and structures. In fact, the cell is one of the most efficient autonomous microscale robotic systems and is comprised of millions of nanoscale molecular machineries, i.e. hardware, such as DNA/RNA and proteins. Furthermore, the cellular processes are results of these molecular machines working in concert governed by complex regulatory circuitry, i.e. software. Interacting synergistically among the hardware and software, the cell functions continuously over a broad range of time scales and span length scales by three orders of magnitude, nanometers to microns. For therapeutic or basic research purposes, it is necessary to manipulate cellular functions. The challenge obviously lies in the complexity of the system, millions of various types of nanoscale machineries and regulatory circuitries still beyond comprehension. The recently developed nano/micro technology based transducers can match the length scale of molecules and cells. As such, the direct interrogation and manipulation of these cellular functions in real-time has become possible. We have demonstrated that properly designed micro/nano robotic systems can direct the cellular functionalities across multiple length scales to efficiently reach the desired control state.

Some remote manipulators, used for decommissioning tasks in the nuclear industry, lack proprioceptive sensors because electronics are vulnerable to radiation. Additionally, even if proprioceptive joint sensors could be retrofitted, such heavy-duty manipulators are often deployed on mobile vehicle platforms, which are significantly and erratically perturbed when powerful hydraulic drilling or cutting tools are deployed at the end-effector. In these scenarios, it would be beneficial to use external sensory information, e.g. vision, for estimating the robot configuration with respect to the scene or task. Conventional visual servoing methods typically rely on joint encoder values for controlling the robot. In contrast, our framework assumes that no joint encoders are available, and estimates the robot configuration by visually tracking several parts of the robot, and then enforcing equality between a set of transformation matrices which relate the frames of the camera, world and tracked robot parts. To accomplish this, we propose two alternative methods based on optimisation. We evaluate the performance of our developed framework by visually tracking the pose of a conventional robot arm, where the joint encoders are used to provide ground-truth for evaluating the precision of the vision system. Additionally, we evaluate the precision with which visual feedback can be used to control the robot's end-effector to follow a desired trajectory."
2617194,22736,23735,Robust environment mapping using flux skeletons,2015,"We consider how to directly extract a road map (also known as a topological representation) of an initially-unknown 2-dimensional environment via an on-line procedure which robustly computes a retraction of its boundaries. While such approaches are well known for their theoretical elegance, computing such representations in practice is complicated when the data is sparse and noisy. In this paper we present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot's navigation needs. The presented approach is an any-time-algorithm which allows for the active creation of topological maps from laser-scan data, as it is being acquired. The resulting map is stable under variations to noise and the initial conditions. The key idea is the use of a flux-based skeletonization algorithm on the latest occupancy grid map. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. The method is evaluated on both synthetic data and in the context of active exploration using a Turtlebot 2. Our results demonstrate complete mapping of different environments with smooth topological abstraction without spurious edges."
913831,22736,23735,Robotic On-Orbit Servicing - DLR's Experience and Perspective,2006,"The increasing number of launched satellites per year, calls for solutions to keep free operational space for telecommunication systems in geo-synchronized orbit, as well as to avoid the endangering of space systems in LEO (low-Earth orbit) and of the public living in the habited parts on Earth. Examples for such dangerous stranded space systems in the past are Skylab and MIR. In the future, the uncontrolled and accidental de-orbiting of other huge satellites is expected, where parts of these will hit the surface of the Earth. A feasible way to handle such problems might be to enforce the operational requirement to use some dedicated residual fuel for a controlled de-orbiting, or in case of GEO (geostationary orbit), to lift the satellites at their end of life into the graveyard orbit. Despite these measures, malfunctions of solar generators, control systems or thrusters cannot be avoided. Therefore, on-orbit servicing (OOS) will be a mandatory and challenging topic for space robotics in the near future. The outcome of national German projects like ROTEX, ESS and GETEX/ETS-VII represent a know-how which can be directly applied for the development of OOS-robotic systems. Control structures and several possible operational modes are discussed within this paper. The recently started national project ROKVISS already provides the necessary space-qualified hardware as well as the very powerful telepresence operational mode. The paper will concentrate on a description of the ROKVISS mission"
2025182,22736,23735,Improvement of adaptive cruise control system based on speed characteristics and time headway,2009,"An adaptive cruise control (ACC) which was implemented on an AIT Intelligent Vehicle, a Mitsubishi Galant car, has been improved and added with more features to allow the vehicle to act with better performance compared with the previous system. An important feature of the new adaptive cruise control system is the ability to maintain a proper inter-vehicle gap based on the speed of leading vehicle and time headway (THW). To develop adaptive cruise control system, the conventional throttle valve system is modified to the drive-by-wire system which uses a DC motor to control the throttle valve position based on PD control with command compensation. In the automatic braking system, a DC motor is installed with steel cable transmission in order to pull the brake pedal to the desired level automatically by applying torque control. The brake control and velocity control have been merged together to control the speed to any desired speeds as fast as possible without jerk and steady-state error. A micro switch is installed at the brake pedal to allow the driver to take over the control of the vehicle anytime. There are three important inputs of the ACC system, speed of leading vehicle read from electronic control unit (ECU), THW set by driver, and actual gap measured from a laser scanner. The ACC processes these three inputs in order to calculate distance error and relative velocity which are used as the two inputs of a fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller determines the desired speed command to maintain a proper gap based on current speed of the leading vehicle and the desired time headway. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the ACC system in various conditions. The results show good performance of the adaptive cruise control system."
2565399,22736,23735,A class of non-linear time scaling functions for smooth time optimal control along specified paths,2015,"Computing time optimal motions along specified paths forms an integral part of the solution methodology for many motion planning problems. Conventionally, this optimal control problem is solved considering piece-wise constant parametrization for the control input which leads to convexity and sparsity in the optimization structure. However, it also results in discontinuous control trajectory which is difficult to track. Thus, in this paper we revisit this time optimal control problem with the primary motivation of ensuring a high degree of smoothness in the resulting motion profile. In particular, we solve it with continuity constraints in control and higher order motion derivatives like jerk, snap etc. It is clear that such constraints would necessitate the use of time varying control inputs over the commonly used piece-wise constant form. The primary contribution of the current work lies in the introduction of a C ∞  class of time scaling functions represented as parametric exponentials. This in turn allows us to represent time varying control inputs as products of parametric exponential and a polynomial functions. We present the motivation behind adopting such representation of time scaling function over more common polynomial forms, both from mathematical as well as implementation standpoint. We also show that the proposed representation of time scaling function and control input leads to a very simple optimization structure where most of the constraints are linear. The non-linearity has a quasi-convex structure which can be reformulated into a simple difference of convex form. Thus, the resulting optimization can be efficiently solved through sequential convex programming where, at each iteration, the constraints in difference of convex form are further simplified to more conservative linear constraints."
2388220,22736,23735,Recursive state-parameter estimation of haptic robotic systems,2011,"In this paper, a nonlinear signal-processing scheme is developed for robotic systems that exploits a joint state-parameter formulation for simultaneous recursive estimation of the states (e.g. joint angles and rates) and uncertain parameters (e.g. inertial and friction parameters), out of noisy measurements (e.g. joint angles). Unscented Kalman filtering was employed to overcome restrictions such as linearity in the parameters and the need for availability of joint velocities and accelerations (present in linear recursive least square methods), and the linearization problems associated with extended Kalman filtering. Owing to the unscented transform concept which requires only input-output evaluations of the dynamic model, a more general and modular implementation is realizable. This allows for the utilization of computational modeling tools without the requirement of symbolically manipulating or deriving the equations of motion. Also, the recursive nature of the scheme allows for both offline processing and online implementation. The practical performance of the proposed scheme was verified through an experiment involving a five-bar linkage based haptic device configured to render a virtual box. The torque pair commands generated by the haptic controller to render the virtual box and the encoder angular measurements acquired through the experiment were processed twice in two different input-output directions: once, for state-parameter estimation of the robot; and, another time for identification of supposedly unknown environmental parameters. Results demonstrate successfulness of the scheme for recursive state-parameter estimation of the robot and the environment, as well as promising applicability in online settings."
1546480,22736,23735,Uncalibrated 3D stereo image-based dynamic visual servoing for robot manipulators,2013,"This paper introduces a new comprehensive solution for the open problem of uncalibrated 3D image-based stereo visual servoing for robot manipulators. One of the main contributions of this article is a novel 3D stereo camera model to map positions in the task space to positions in a new 3D Visual Cartesian Space (a visual feature space where 3D positions are measured in pixel). This model is used to compute a full-rank Image Jacobian Matrix (J img ), which solves several common problems presented on the classical image Jacobians, e.g., image space singularities and local minima. This Jacobian is a fundamental key for the image-based control design, where uncalibrated stereo camera systems can be used to drive a robot manipulator. Furthermore, an adaptive second order sliding mode visual servo control is designed to track 3D visual motions using the 3D trajectory errors defined in the Visual Cartesian Space. The stability of the control in closed loop with a dynamic robot system is formally analyzed and proved, where exponential convergence of errors in the Visual Cartesian Space and task space without local minima are demonstrated. The complete control system is evaluated both in simulation and on a real industrial robot. The robustness of the control scheme is evaluated for cases where the extrinsic parameters of the stereo camera system change on-line and the kinematic/dynamic robot parameters are considered as unknown. This approach offers a proper solution for the common problem of visual occlusion, since the stereo system can be moved to obtain a clear view of the task at any time."
1963998,22736,23735,Trajectory formation of arm movement by a single particle approximation strategy inspired from biological reaching movement,2003,"It is clear that many creatures including human being and macaque have dealt with multi joint arm movement by taking a special control strategy from many biological experiments. These studies said that when moving the hand between pairs of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly straight hand trajectories with single-peaked, bell-shaped speed profiles. For explaining this experimental result, many of movement control strategies have been proposed so far, though, there are many of the problems for resolving multi-joint arm control. Kawato said that the major problem is collected into two ill-posed problems. First is the way of selecting a single trajectory from the possible movement. Second is the control problem for realizing the planned trajectory by deciding each of the joint torque and for reaching the whole actuator system to an objective position. First of all, we argue that what advantage a creature gets by taking a bell-shaped speed profiles control strategy form the viewpoint of simple single particle movement experiments and discuss the way of realizing the control procedure. In this paper, we proposed a new control strategy which the speed profiles of the end-effector is modified as the bell-shaped form actively. We regard the end-effector of a multi joint system as a kind of single particle system in this method. By the subsumption, the control problem of the multi-joint system movement can be simplified. And we will show that the proposed strategy accomplish the control of a two-link arm reaching movement, and after that, realize a standing up movement of human model by constructing four link systems which use the physical parameter of human being."
2103618,22736,23735,Particle filtering for localization in robotic assemblies with position uncertainty,2005,"This paper deals with the class of robotic assemblies where position uncertainty far exceeds assembly clearance, and visual assistance is not available to resolve the uncertainty. Under this scenario, we can implement a localization strategy that resolves the uncertainty using a pre-acquired map of all possible peg-hole contact configurations. Prior to assembly, the strategy explores the contact configuration space (C-space) by sequentially bringing the peg (under different configurations) into contact with the stationary (fixtured) hole and matching the contact configurations thus recorded with the map. The different peg configurations can be actively chosen to maximize uncertainty-reduction. However, with a sampled map of the contact C-space, discretization errors are introduced, and implementing deterministic matching (at the fine-grained level necessary for assembly) would soon become prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. Additionally, with global initial uncertainty, multiple solutions abound in our localization problem. In this paper, we introduce a particle filter implementation which can not only handle the discretization errors in map-matching, but also track multiple solutions simultaneously. The particle filter implementation was validated on computer simulations of round and square peg-in-hole assemblies, before testing it on corresponding actual robotic assemblies. The implementation was highly successful on both the assemblies, reducing the uncertainty by more than 95 % and making it easy for a previously-devised compliant strategy to achieve assembly. Results from the simulations and actual assemblies are reported. We also present a comparison of these results (using random localization: peg moves selected randomly) with preliminary results from assemblies using active localization."
2474624,22736,23735,The Window Corner Algorithm For Planning Translational Paths Among Polyhedral Subassemblies,1992,"In this paper, we present a complete and ex- act algorithm for planning a geometrically feasible path for a polyhedral subassembly (robot) translating amongst poly- hedral obstacles. Our algorithm can be used to determine whether a pair of non-convex subassemblies can be separated by a sequence of fine-motions and, possibly, contact-motions, when the amount of free space tends to be severly limited. We present the three-dimensional Window Corner algorithm to plan feasible paths. The algorithm solves the FeosiblePath problem, in worst-case time O(m5) where m is the product of the number of vertices describing the robot and obstacles respectively. A Feasiblepath solution hierarchy, for assembly sequence planning, is described for incremental, straight-line and multi-step paths. The Polyhedral Cone Representation (PCR) is introduced to efficiently represent the geometrical constraints on trans- lation and as a basis for fast collision avoidance checks. We introduce the concept of Window Corners in the PCR and this results in a finite search space. The Polyhedral Cone Obstacle Representation (PCUR), which is a constructive representation of all boundary contact configurations, trans- forms the problem into that of a point moving amongst a col- lection, O(m), of convex obstacles. In comparison, the worst- case space complexity of the C-space boundary is O(m3). Certain contact-constrained, feasible motions, which lie on surfaces without interior points can be inaccessible in a typ id C-space representation."
1762171,22736,23735,Composing and coordinating body models of arbitrary connectivity and redundancy: A biomimmetic field computing approach,2009,"The subjective ease with which we move gracefully in constraint filled uncertain environments often masks the enormously complex integrative apparatus needed to spell synergy among the thousands of sensors, joints, musculo-skeletal units and neuronal populations that contribute to any act's planning and execution. In this paper, we apply the computational framework of passive motion paradigm [5] for task specific composition and coordination of the movements of a limb, network of limbs (e.g. left arm-waist-right arm) or networks of external objects coupled to the body of the 53 degrees of freedom humanoid robot ‘iCub’. The basic PMP model is further extended by formulation of a pair of branching nodes that allow compositionality and transfer of force fields from one relaxation network to another. The generality of the proposed approach is further illustrated using simulations of whole body reaching (WBR) tasks from a quiet standing posture that recruits virtually all the joints of the upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk, binding together a large number of degrees of freedom into a functional unit that combines a focal task (reaching a target with the hand) and a postural task (keeping the projection of the center of mass within the bipedal support area). Preliminary comparisons of the solutions generated by the computational model with the movements of human subjects performing similar WBR tasks are presented."
2595911,22736,23735,Robust learning of tensegrity robot control for locomotion through form-finding,2015,"Robots based on tensegrity structures have the potential to be robust, efficient and adaptable. While traditionally being difficult to control, recent control strategies for ball-shaped tensegrity robots have successfully enabled punctuated rolling, hill-climbing and obstacle climbing. These gains have been made possible through the use of machine learning and physics simulations that allow controls to be “learned” instead of being engineered in a top-down fashion. While effective in simulation, these emergent methods unfortunately give little insight into how to generalize the learned control strategies and evaluate their robustness. These robustness issues are especially important when applied to physical robots as there exists errors with respect to the simulation, which may prevent the physical robot from actually rolling. This paper describes how the robustness can be addressed in three ways: 1) We present a dynamic relaxation technique that describes the shape of a tensegrity structure given the forces on its cables; 2) We then show how control of a tensegrity robot “ball” for locomotion can be decomposed into finding its shape and then determining the position of the center of mass relative to the supporting polygon for this new shape; 3) Using a multi-step Monte Carlo based learning algorithm, we determine the structural geometry that pushes the center of mass out of the supporting polygon to provide the most robust basic mobility step that can lead to rolling. Combined, these elements will give greater insight into the control process, provide an alternative to the existing physics simulations and offer a greater degree of robustness to bridge the gap between simulation and hardware."

In its wheeled configuration, shown in Fig. 1, AZIMUT-3 uses eight actuators for locomotion: four for propulsion and four for steering the wheels, which can rotate 180 degrees around their steering axis. Propulsion is done using standard DC brushless motors (Bayside K064050-3Y) with optical encoders (US Digital E4-300-157-HUB, 0.3 deg of resolution), capable of reaching 1.47 m/s. The platform uses steerable wheels motorized using differential elastic actuators (DEA) [2], [3], which provide compliance, safety and torque control capabilities. AZIMUT-3's hardware architecture consists of distributed modules for sensing and low-level control, communicating with each other through a 1 Mbps CAN bus. A Mini-ITX computer equipped with a 2.0 GHz Core 2 duo processor running Linux with real-time patches (RT-PREEMPT) is used on-board for high-level control modules. Nickel-metal hydride batteries provide power to the platform for up to 3 hours of autonomy. A passive vertical suspension mechanism (Rosta springs) is used to connect the wheels to AZIMUT-3's chassis, allowing them to keep contact with the ground on uneven surfaces.

2092847,22736,23735,An advanced sonar ring design with 48 channels of continuous echo processing using matched filters,2009,"Advanced sonar systems produce both accurate range and bearing measurements rather than just range alone as in conventional systems. Previous advanced sonar rings do not process incoming echo data as it arrives, but only after a completed measurement cycle and only on limited data samples that are above a noise floor threshold. The system described in this paper can process all echo data, as it is produced, with full matched filtering tuned to each receiver on all echo samples directly implemented in hardware. This minimises measurement latency, important for real time robotics applications and also provides optimal arrival time estimates due to the matched filters. Previous systems have used sequential firing of many transmitters around the ring to prevent interference between transmitters or used different pulses fired simultaneously. This paper presents a single transmitter solution where a reflector disperses a single ultrasonic pulse evenly around the sonar ring. Processing is performed with a dedicated hardware data processing architecture implemented with a Field Programmable Gate Array to achieve the desired real time performance. The system reports range and bearing results at a rate of 30 measurement cycles a second in a full 360 degree coverage to ranges up to 4 metres with the prototype processing over 4.9 Giga-arithmetic operations per second. Experimental results are presented that show the performance of the system is suitable for high speed mapping and localisation applications."
1817635,22736,23735,FPGA-based Control System for Miniature Robots,2006,"Resource-constrained miniature robots require small but high-performance onboard processing unit and re-configurable electrical hardware to carry out different missions. The advances in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology offer a system on programmable chip (SoPC) solution to this demand. This paper describes the technical achievement in developing FPGA-based control system which utilizes the hardware/software re-configurable feature of the advanced FPGA device to achieve the goal. We have implemented the hardware module inside the FPGA chip to generate PWM output and to count quadrate encoder pulses, which are the basic building blocks to drive DC motors. Software is developed to implement PID control algorithm using the PWM-Encoder module and on-chip processor. The functional correctness of the closed-loop control system is verified by the experimental tests. The performance analysis shows that the hardware module occupies less FPGA space and the power dissipation is very much comparable to other design alternatives of similar caliber. The preliminary results demonstrate that the PWM-Encoder module, in the form of user Intellectual Property (IP), can be duplicated and re-configured to control as many motors as needed. The success gives us a confidence boost to continue our effort to build user IP library for robotics applications which will benefit the robotics community by providing development tools and FPGA building blocks to satisfy the demand for an extremely flexible, high-performance, onboard computing unit."
1960281,22736,23735,Acceleration compensation for vehicle based telesurgery on earth or in space,2008,"Current telesurgical robotic systems are designed to be used exclusively in stationary environments. The ability of a robotic master and slave system to monitor and correct for acceleration induced movement errors would enable conduct of delicate medical procedures onboard moving vehicles. Such operations, without compensation, would be complicated by unintended movement of the surgeonpsilas hands and master controls, causing potentially dangerous response of the surgical robot manipulators. In caring for astronauts on long haul interplanetary missions, it is essential to compensate for alterations in gravitational acceleration when delivering telesurgical or autonomous robotic therapy in the microgravity of space or on non-terrestrial planetary surfaces. This paper introduces new work focused on compensating for unintended master and slave manipulator motion resulting from accelerations of the environment within which they are operated. Experimental results from vehicular operation show how induced motion can be reduced by introduction of dynamic electronic balancing of the master manipulator device and the addition of variable damping proportional to vehicle acceleration. A surgical master console and robot were operated in the micro-gravity and variable gravity of the NASA C-9 airborne parabolic laboratory. Robot kinematics data and surveys of surgeon and astronaut users show that compensating for different gravitational conditions improves usability of the system. Further experiments using an elevator as a motion platform demonstrate the effectiveness of acceleration compensation."
2433693,22736,23735,A comparative study of rheology MSD models whose structures are lattice and truss,2004,"In this paper, we compare two major structures of MSD (mass-spring-damper) particle models. One is the lattice (hexahedral) structure, and the other is the truss (tetrahedral) structure. They (especially, the truss structure) have been frequently used for representing elastic and/or visco-elastic object. The MSD model efficiently calculates shape deformation of the above materials. In addition, in order to maintain shape precision of each deformation, we carefully calibrate coefficients of damper and spring of Voigt part and a coefficient of damper of the other part in the basic MSD element under many surface points capturing a real rheologic object. A genetic algorithm is used for probabilistic calibration. After the comparison, we get the following properties: (1) the lattice structure has too many elements for calculating force propagation. Therefore, it precisely leads shape deformation with the help of the local (feedforward) volume constant condition. (2) The truss structure does not have enough elements for propagating internal forces, therefore, in order to keep a reasonable volume by expanding its virtual rheology object, we need the global (feedback) volume constant condition. (3) The global condition is time consuming, but can directly control the total volume of virtual rheology object. On the other hand, the local one is quick, but directly expands only a part (voxel) of the virtual object. Therefore, the volume and shape in the lattice structure with the local condition are better than those in the truss structure including the global one. (4) The number of MSD elements in the lattice structure is about two times larger than that in the truss one. Therefore, the former calculation is about two times slower than the latter one. As contrasted with this, the global volume constant condition is strictly two times or slower than the local one. As a result, calculation time of the lattice structure with the local condition is smaller than that of the truss structure with the global one. In conclusion, the lattice structure with the local volume constant condition is the best concerning to calculation cost and shape precision."
2607749,22736,23735,Modeling and control of a novel home-based cable-driven parallel platform robot: PACER,2015,"This paper focuses on various control strategies for a modular cable-articulated parallel robotic manipulator called PACER (Parallel Articulated-Cable Exercise Robot). The proposed robotic device is comprised of multiple cables and a single antagonistically actuated prismatic joint which connects a six degrees-of-freedom moving platform to a fixed base. This novel design provides an attractive architecture for implementation of a home-based rehabilitation device as an alternative to expensive serial robots. In this paper, after deriving the dynamic equations via Newton-Euler formulation, the development of different control strategies in the context of upper limb rehabilitation in three-dimensional space will be examined. The various control modes include: (i) passive mode through feedback linearization for recovering functionalities of the joints at the first step of post-stroke rehabilitation, (ii) active mode via admittance controller for assisting patient to do tasks better, and finally (iii) resistive mode via stiffness controller for increasing the muscle strength. This is now evaluated via a simulation case-study and development of a physical testbed is underway. Since the human arm consists of seven degrees-of-freedom, and daily activities of upper limbs are combination of motions of these simple joints, this proposed design with various control strategies has enormous potential for neurological remapping and brain plasticity in post-stroke patients with upper limb injuries."
1339128,22736,23735,Environmental monitoring with mobile robots,2005,"This paper describes an architecture for estimating environmental odor maps and presents experimental results obtained using that architecture with five mobile robots inside a large laboratory with two odor sources and forced ventilation. The mobile sensing agents employed in the experiments have self localization capabilities and carry an electronic nose and a thermal anemometer. The proposed architecture allows integrating sparse olfaction data gathered by the mobile agents along their trajectories and dynamically estimate the spatial concentration of different odor fields. The data assimilation process is made centrally by a PC that polls periodically each robot through a RF network in order to get the data gathered during the previous acquisition period. The estimation of odor fields is made in two steps: first each agent estimates the odor mixture and concentration by means of a neural network-based regression algorithm that converts values from gas sensor space to the corresponding odor space. Then the sensed data is assimilated into an advection-diffusion model by means of a reduced order Kalman filter. In the current implementation the central controller, responsible for the maps estimation, specifies to each agent their target area to explore. The proposed architecture was validated with a set of experiments that demonstrated its ability to estimate and capture the dynamics of overlapping odor fields. This work can easily be adapted to city buses or other local transportation systems in order to monitor the pollution or quickly detect hazardous chemicals inside cities."
886940,22736,23735,Time scaled collision cone based trajectory optimization approach for reactive planning in dynamic environments,2014,"The current paper proposes a trajectory optimization approach for navigating a non-holonomic wheeled mobile robot in dynamic environments. The dynamic obstacle's motion is not known and hence is represented by a band of predicted trajectories. The trajectory optimization can account for large number of predicted obstacle trajectories and seeks to avoid each predicted trajectory of every obstacle in the sensing range of the robot. The two primary contributions of the proposed trajectory optimization are (1): A computationally efficient method for computing the intersection space of collision avoidance constraints of large number of predicted obstacle trajectories. (2): A optimization framework to connect the current state to the solution space in time optimal fashion. The intersection/solution space computation is build on our earlier proposed concept of time scaled collision cone, which can be solved in closed form to obtain a set of formulae. These formulae describe how much and in what manner the temporal specification of a trajectory needs to be changed to avoid a given set of dynamic obstacles. This allows us to quickly evaluate solution space of time scaled collision cone over various candidate trajectories, thus reducing the problem of computing the intersection space to that of generating multiple homotopic trajectories. The optimization framework used to connect the current state to the solution space in time optimal fashion is based on the concept of non-linear time scaling, which induces a difference of convex form structure. Thus, on the theoretical side, we show that the various components of the proposed framework are computationally simple and involves solving sets of linear equations and using state of the art convex programming techniques. On the practical side we show that the proposed planner performs better than sampling based planners which treat dynamic obstacles as static over a short duration of time"
2597214,22736,23735,Submap matching for stereo-vision based indoor/outdoor SLAM,2015,"Autonomous robots operating in semi- or unstructured environments, e.g. during search and rescue missions, require methods for online on-board creation of maps to support path planning and obstacle avoidance. Perception based on stereo cameras is well suited for mixed indoor/outdoor environments. The creation of full 3D maps in GPS-denied areas however is still a challenging task for current robot systems, in particular due to depth errors resulting from stereo reconstruction. State-of-the-art 6D SLAM approaches employ graph-based optimization on the relative transformations between keyframes or local submaps. To achieve loop closures, correct data association is crucial, in particular for sensor input received at different points in time. In order to approach this challenge, we propose a novel method for submap matching. It is based on robust keypoints, which we derive from local obstacle classification. By describing geometrical 3D features, we achieve invariance to changing viewpoints and varying light conditions. We performed experiments in indoor, outdoor and mixed environments. In all three scenarios we achieved a final 3D position error of less than 0.23% of the full trajectory. In addition, we compared our approach with a 3D RBPF SLAM from previous work, achieving an improvement of at least 27% in mean 2D localization accuracy in different scenarios."
1897324,22736,23735,Active knee-release mechanism for passive-dynamic walking machines and walking cycle research,2008,"Passive-dynamic walkers are mechanical devices that walk down a slope without motors or controllers. In this paper we present our research in two distinctive parts. First, a design improvement on the classical four-legged passive-dynamic walking machine and second, an investigation on the timing of different stages in the human walking cycle and comparison of the results with the results obtained from our walker. We built a four-legged passive-dynamic walking machine with its inner and outer legs connected rigidly two by two, making it equivalent to a biped machine from a dynamics point of view. It features a new mechanism for an active release of the locked extended knee instead of using the more common knee-locking via suction cups mechanism. We conducted a series of experiments with this modified walker in which we counted the steps it made while walking down an incline. We compared the results with a previous design of the knee-locking mechanism that used permanent magnets. The improved model made an increased number of successful walks down the slope from which we concluded that the new active release mechanism is more reliable and easy to use and set up. For the walking cycle investigation, we put visual markers on a person walking casually down the same slope that we used for the walker experiments. We took a video of that person and measured the times between different events in one walking cycle. We calculated the average time intervals and made a comparison between the test subject and our walker within one cycle. We feel the timings derived from this investigation can be used to make the gait of our walker more human-like."
1702649,22736,23735,Real-time 3D Collision Avoidance Method for Safe Human and Robot Coexistence,2006,"A novel solution to the three-dimensional dynamic human-robot collision problem is presented. Sphere-based geometric models are used for the human and robot due to the efficiency of the distance computation. The collision avoidance algorithm searches for collision-free paths by moving the end-effector along a set of pre-defined search directions. An optimization method is employed to select the search direction that balances between the robot approaching its goal location, and maximizing the distances between the human and robot models. The optimization incorporates predictions of the motions of the robot and human to reduce the negative effects of a non-instantaneous robot time response. The robot prediction is based on a transfer function model of its experimental time response at the joint level. The human prediction is performed at the sphere level using the weighted mean of past velocities. Predicting at the sphere level eliminates the difficulty introduced by the limbs moving in different directions. After describing the collision avoidance algorithm, a human walking towards a moving Puma robot arm is simulated. Captured motion data is used to make the human motion realistic. Monte Carlo simulations using 1000 random human walking paths passing through the robot workspace are used to evaluate the algorithm. The algorithm prevented all collisions due to the robot.

Normal human speech is very difficult to process, requiring many kinds of complex analysis for robots to interpret it. An intermediate method for communication is recognition of prosody, the affective content of speech. Using prosody recognition, a human interacting with a robot can reward or punish its actions by scolding or praising it. In this project, prosody recognition of male voices is performed by feature-based analysis of sound files containing short utterances, which were recorded from subjects who were directed to emulate infant-directed speech, which generally contains exaggerated prosody (Breazeal, C and Aryanada, L, 2000). The features used are extracted from the energy and pitch contours in the preprocessing stage. The classifier discriminates amongst four affective classes of speech and neutral utterances. The four classes are prohibition, attentional bids, approval, and soothing, while the neutral utterances are speech, which carries none of the above affective intents. Discrimination is performed using a multistage k-nearest neighbor classifier. The five-way single-stage classifier operates at 62.5 accuracy on the entire male speech data set, while the female single-stage classifier classifies 66.7 percent correctly. Chi-square analysis resulted in a p of less than or equal to 0.001 for each. The data seem to indicate that while female voice data may be somewhat easier to classify than male, fundamental differences that make male utterances unsuitable for classification do not exist."
2453496,22736,23735,Scalable and convergent multi-robot passive and active sensing,2009,"A major barrier preventing the wide employment of mobile networks of robots in tasks such as exploration, mapping, surveillance, and environmental monitoring is the lack of efficient and scalable multi-robot passive and active sensing (estimation) methodologies. The main reason for this is the absence of theoretical and practical tools that can provide computationally tractable methodologies which can deal efficiently with the highly nonlinear and uncertain nature of multi-robot dynamics when employed in the aforementioned tasks. In this paper, a new approach is proposed and analyzed for developing efficient and scalable methodologies for a general class of multi-robot passive and active sensing applications. The proposed approach employs an estimation scheme that switches among linear elements and, as a result, its computational requirements are about the same as those of a linear estimator. The parameters of the switching estimator are calculated off-line using a convex optimization algorithm which is based on optimization and approximation using Sum-of-Squares (SoS) polynomials. As shown by rigorous arguments, the estimation accuracy of the proposed scheme is equal to the optimal estimation accuracy plus a term that is inversely proportional to the number of estimator's switching elements (or, equivalently, to the memory storage capacity of the robots' equipment). The proposed approach can handle various types of constraints such as communication and computational constraints as well as obstacle avoidance and maximum speed constraints and can treat both problems of passive and active sensing in a unified manner. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a 3D active target tracking application employing flying robots."
2547981,22736,23735,"Inspection system for very thin and fragile surfaces, based on a pair of wall climbing robots with magnetic wheels",2007,"In this paper describes a pair of wall climbing robots that use magnetic wheels for adhesion. They are designed for inspecting the interior surfaces of gas-tanks in oversea ships. Environments like this were impossible to access by previous climbing robots, as they are made out of very thin sheet metal that cannot support a high robot mass and contain several types of difficult obstacles. In order to master these challenges, the system described in this work uses two robots in a mother-child-structure: the smaller robot is built very lightweight and simple, without the ability to steer or climb vertically. It just moves horizontally and uses ridges in the gas tank surface as guidance rails. In order to pass from one ridge to the next one, the smaller robot docks to the bigger mother-robot. This robot always stays in an area where the sheet metal is thicker and never enters the extremely fragile surfaces. Thus, its mass is not critical for the structural stability of the environment and the robot can hence be built big enough to be able to climb in all directions of gravity and to pass difficult obstacles along its path. In the present paper, the basic concept, the mechanical design of all important components and the proposed control strategy are described briefly, followed by test results of the most critical components. An outlook to similar applications to which the basic idea of this work can be successfully transferred concludes this article."
1070000,22736,23735,Using haptics to extract object shape from rotational manipulations,2014,"Increasingly widespread available haptic sensors mounted on articulated hands offer new sensory channels that can complement shape extraction from vision to enable a more robust handling of objects in cases when vision is restricted or even unavailable. However, to estimate object shape from haptic interaction data is a difficult challenge due to the complexity of the contact interaction between the movable object and sensor surfaces, leading to a coupled estimation problem of shape and object pose. While for vision efficient solutions to the underlying SLAM problem are known, the available information is much sparser in the tactile case, posing great difficulties for a straightforward adoption of standard SLAM algorithms. In the present paper, we thus explore whether a biologically inspired model based on dynamic neural fields can offer a route towards a practical algorithm for tactile SLAM. Our study is focused on a restricted scenario where a two-fingered robot hand manipulates an n-gon with a fixed rotational axis. We demonstrate that our model can accumulate shape information from reasonably short interaction sequences and autonomously build a representation despite significant ambiguity of the tactile data due to the rotational periodicity of the object. We conclude that the presented framework may be a suitable basis to solve the tactile SLAM problem also in more general settings which will be the focus of subsequent work. I. INTRODUCTION"
2928489,22736,23735,Predicting actions to act predictably: Cooperative partial motion planning with maximum entropy models,2016,"This paper reports on a data-driven motion planning approach for interaction-aware, socially-compliant robot navigation among human agents. Autonomous mobile robots navigating in workspaces shared with human agents require motion planning techniques providing seamless integration and smooth navigation in such. Smooth integration in mixed scenarios calls for two abilities of the robot: predicting actions of others and acting predictably for them. The former requirement requests trainable models of agent behaviors in order to accurately forecast their actions in the future, taking into account their reaction on the robot's decisions. A human-like navigation style of the robot facilitates other agents—most likely not aware of the underlying planning technique applied—to predict the robot motion vice versa, resulting in smoother joint navigation. The approach presented in this paper is based on a feature-based maximum entropy model and is able to guide a robot in an unstructured, real-world environment. The model is trained to predict joint behavior of heterogeneous groups of agents from onboard data of a mobile platform. We evaluate the benefit of interaction-aware motion planning in a realistic public setting with a total distance traveled of over 4 km. Interestingly the motion models learned from human-human interaction did not hold for robot-human interaction, due to the high attention and interest of pedestrians in testing basic braking functionality of the robot."
2635384,22736,23735,Two-dimensional orthoglide mechanism for revealing areflexive human arm mechanical properties,2015,"The most accurate and dependable approach to the in-vivo identification of human limb stiffness is by position perturbation. Moving the limb over a small distance and measuring the effective force gives, when states are steady, direct information about said stiffness. However, existing manipulandi are comparatively slow and/or not very stiff, such that a lumped stiffness is measured. This lumped stiffness includes the limb response during or after reflexes influenced by both, the passive musculotendon and active neuronal component. As this approach usually leads to inconsistencies between the data and the stiffness model, we argue in favour of fast, pre-reflex impedance measurements—i.e., completing the perturbation movement and collecting the data before effects of spinal reflexes or even from the motor cortex can influence the measurements. To obtain such fast planar movements, we constructed a dedicated orthoglide robot while focusing on a lightweight and stiff design. Our subject study of a force task with this device lead to very clean data with always positive definite Cartesian stiffness matrices. By representing them as ellipses, we found them to be substantially bigger in comparison to standard literature which we address to a larger number of recruited motor units. While ellipses orientation and the length of their main axis increased, the shape decreased with the exerted force. The device will be used to derive design criteria for variable-stiffness robots, and to investigate the relation between muscular activity and areflexive joint stiffness for teleoperational approaches."
761824,22736,23735,A pipeline for structured light bathymetric mapping,2012,"This paper details a methodology for using structured light laser imaging to create high resolution bathymetric maps of the sea floor. The system includes a pair of stereo cameras and an inclined 532nm sheet laser mounted to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). While a structured light system generally requires a single camera, a stereo vision set up is used here for in-situ calibration of the laser system geometry by triangulating points on the laser line. This allows for quick calibration at the survey site and does not require precise jigs or a controlled environment. A batch procedure to extract the laser line from the images to sub-pixel accuracy is also presented. The method is robust to variations in image quality and moderate amounts of water column turbidity. The final maps are constructed using a reformulation of a previous bathymetric Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm called incremental Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM). The iSAM framework is adapted from previous applications to perform sub-mapping, where segments of previously visited terrain are registered to create relative pose constraints. The resulting maps can be gridded at one centimeter and have significantly higher sample density than similar surveys using high frequency multibeam sonar or stereo vision. Results are presented for sample surveys at a submerged archaeological site and sea floor rock outcrop."
2192417,22736,23735,Implementation of real time spatial mapping in robotic systems through self-organizing neural networks,1995,"Presents a methodology which allows an autonomous agent i.e., a mobile robot, to learn and build maps of its operating environment by relying only on its range sensors. The maps, described with respect to the robot's inertial frame, are developed in real time by correlating robot position and sensory data. This latter feature characterizes part of the uniqueness of the authors' approach. These maps are topologically isomorphic to the maps created for the same room(s) by humans. The methodology exploits the principle of self-organization, implemented as an artificial neural network module which processes incoming sensor range data. The generation of environmental maps can be visualized as an elastic string of neurons whereby every neuron represents a finite portion of the physical world. This elastic string stretches dynamically so as to take on the shape of the environment, a unique characteristic of the authors' methodology. In this respect, the neural net provides a discretized representation of the continuous physical environment as the latter is seen through the robot's own sensors. Experiments, focused on indoor applications, have successfully demonstrated the ability of a robot to build maps of geometrically complex environments. The results presented in this paper, compared with the authors' earlier efforts, show significant improvement in that every single sensor data point contributes equally to the location of the neurons of the spatial map at the end of the learning process. This is important because the authors wish to minimize the effect of the order in which data points are processed."
1158097,22736,23735,Developing Virtual Testbeds for mobile robotic applications in the woods and on the moon,2010,"Simulation in the context of engineering often focuses on very special details of global systems. Robot designers usually begin with the analysis of new actuators and joint designs. This corresponds to a “bottom-up”-strategy in the development of simulation models. For classical fields of application of robotics, e.g. in production plants with a well defined environment this is the approved method, because it allows very detailed insights into the analyzed subsystems. On the other hand, unpredictable effects of the interaction of multiple subsystems may easily be overseen. In particular, nontechnical environments like in moon exploration tasks or in a biological environment like in forestry applications are hard to describe in an analytical way to integrate them into an analytical simulation model. This is why this paper presents the idea and some practical aspects of the development of “Virtual Testbeds”. In a Virtual Testbed, the entire system is simulated as a whole in Virtual Reality - not only small subsystems of a global system. According to the requirements different subsystems are simulated with different levels of detail. In contrast to the classical “bottom-up”-strategy this can be seen as a “top-down”-approach. Therefore the employment of a multi-body dynamics system as a platform for the development of versatile simulation and testing environments is proposed. Using the examples of the evaluation and testing of an extraterrestrial walking exploration robot design and the development of a method for self-localization in forestry, the idea is further deepened. As a special field of attention the integration of a method of soil simulation as a particular requirement of a Virtual Testbed for walking exploration robots is presented."
1377657,22736,23735,Manipulator state estimation with low cost accelerometers and gyroscopes,2012,"Robot manipulator designs are increasingly focused on low cost approaches, especially those envisioned for use in unstructured environments such as households, office spaces and hazardous environments. The cost of angular sensors varies based on the precision offered. For tasks in these environments, millimeter order manipulation errors are unlikely to cause drastic reduction in performance. In this paper, estimates the joint angles of a manipulator using low cost triaxial accelerometers by taking the difference between consecutive acceleration vectors. The accelerometer-based angle is compensated with a uniaxial gyroscope using a complementary filter to give robust measurements. Three compensation strategies are compared: complementary filter, time varying complementary filter, and extended Kalman filter. This sensor setup can also accurately track the joint angle even when the joint axis is parallel to gravity and the accelerometer data does not provide useful information. In order to analyze this strategy, accelerometers and gyroscopes were mounted on one arm of a PR2 robot. The arm was manually moved smoothly through different trajectories in its workspace while the joint angle readings from the on-board optical encoders were compared against the joint angle estimates from the accelerometers and gyroscopes. The low cost angle estimation strategy has a mean error 1.3° over the three joints estimated, resulting in mean end effector position errors of 6.1 mm or less. This system provides an effective angular measurement as an alternative to high precision encoders in low cost manipulators and as redundant measurements for safety in other manipulators."
2094791,22736,23735,Contact-based navigation for an autonomous flying robot,2013,"Autonomous navigation in obstacle-dense indoor environments is very challenging for flying robots due to the high risk of collisions, which may lead to mechanical damage of the platform and eventual failure of the mission. While conventional approaches in autonomous navigation favor obstacle avoidance strategies, recent work showed that collision-robust flying robots could hit obstacles without breaking and even self-recover after a crash to the ground. This approach is particularly interesting for autonomous navigation in complex environments where collisions are unavoidable, or for reducing the sensing and control complexity involved in obstacle avoidance. This paper aims at showing that collision-robust platforms can go a step further and exploit contacts with the environment to achieve useful navigation tasks based on the sense of touch. This approach is typically useful when weight restrictions prevent the use of heavier sensors, or as a low-level detection mechanism supplementing other sensing modalities. In this paper, a solution based on force and inertial sensors used to detect obstacles all around the robot is presented. Eight miniature force sensors, weighting 0.9g each, are integrated in the structure of a collision-robust flying platform without affecting its robustness. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the use of contact sensing for exploring autonomously a room in 3D, showing significant advantages compared to a previous strategy. To our knowledge this is the first fully autonomous flying robot using touch sensors as only exteroceptive sensors."
2617959,22736,23735,Learning peripersonal space representation through artificial skin for avoidance and reaching with whole body surface,2015,"With robots leaving factory environments and entering less controlled domains, possibly sharing living space with humans, safety needs to be guaranteed. To this end, some form of awareness of their body surface and the space surrounding it is desirable. In this work, we present a unique method that lets a robot learn a distributed representation of space around its body (or peripersonal space) by exploiting a whole-body artificial skin and through physical contact with the environment. Every taxel (tactile element) has a visual receptive field anchored to it. Starting from an initially blank state, the distance of every object entering this receptive field is visually perceived and recorded, together with information whether the object has eventually contacted the particular skin area or not. This gives rise to a set of probabilities that are updated incrementally and that carry information about the likelihood of particular events in the environment contacting a particular set of taxels. The learned representation naturally serves the purpose of predicting contacts with the whole body of the robot, which is of clear behavioral relevance. Furthermore, we devised a simple avoidance controller that is triggered by this representation, thus endowing a robot with a “margin of safety” around its body. Finally, simply reversing the sign in the controller we used gives rise to simple “reaching” for objects in the robot's vicinity, which automatically proceeds with the most activated (closest) body part."
2582146,22736,23735,Design and control of a micro ball-balancing robot (MBBR) with orthogonal midlatitude omniwheel placement,2015,"Ball-balancing robots (BBRs) are endowed with rich dynamics. When properly designed and stabilized via feedback to eliminate jitter, and intuitively coordinated with a well-designed smartphone interface, BBRs exhibit a uniquely fluid and organic motion. Unlike mobile inverted pendulums (MIPs, akin to unmanned Segways), BBRs stabilize both fore/aft and left/right motions with feedback, and bank when turning. Previous research on BBRs focused on vehicles from 50cm to 2m in height; the present work is the first to build significantly smaller BBRs, with heights under 25cm. We consider the unique issues arising when miniaturizing a BBR to such a scale, which are characterized by faster time scales and reduced weight (and, thus, reduced normal force and stiction between the omniwheels and the ball). Two key patent-pending aspects of our design are (a) moving the omniwheels to contact the ball down to around 20 to 30 deg N latitude, which increases the normal force between the omniwheels and the ball, and (b) orienting the omniwheels into mutually-orthogonal planes, which improves efficiency. Design iterations were facilitated by rapid prototyping and leveraged low-cost manufacturing principles and inexpensive components. Classical successive loop closure control strategies are implemented, which prove to be remarkably effective when the BBR isn't spinning quickly, and thus the left/right and fore/aft stabilization problems decompose into two decoupled MIP problems."
2216599,22736,23735,On the Importance of Asymmetries in Grasp Quality Metrics for Tendon Driven Hands,2006,"Grasp quality measures are important for understanding how to plan for and maintain appropriate and secure grasps for pick and place operations and tool use. Most grasp quality measures assume certain symmetries about the mechanism or the task. For example, contact points may be considered to be independent and identical, or an ellipsoidal measure such as the force manipulability ellipsoid may be used. However, many tasks have strong asymmetries, where wrenches in certain directions dominate. Tendon driven hand designs may also have strong asymmetries, leading to differing abilities to apply contact forces in different directions. This paper begins to explore empirically the validity of some of the symmetry assumptions employed by common grasp quality metrics. We examine the human hand and the shadow robot hand, and find that force abilities vary with finger choice and with location of the contact on the finger for both hands. However, while the human hand shows dramatic changes for different poses due to its asymmetric design, the shadow hand, with a symmetric design shows much smaller changes and resembles the assumption of identical and independent contact points reasonably well. Thus, we suggest that the underlying design of the hand is a very important factor to consider for grasp quality metrics and for grasp planning and control. The specific grasp quality metric we study in this paper also brings together a variety of previous research. We outline a linear programming approach for computing a grasp quality metric that includes tendon force constraints and contact constraints and can handle any task described as a polytope in wrench space"
2608070,22736,23735,Motion planning for redundant manipulators in uncertain environments based on tactile feedback,2015,"The exploitation of new fields of application in addition to traditional industrial production for robot manipulators (e.g. agriculture, human areas) requires extensions to the sensor as well as to the planning capabilities. Motion planning solely based on visual information performs poorly in cluttered environments since contacts with obstacles might be inevitable and thus a distinction between hard and soft objects has to be made. In our contribution we present a novel intrinsic tactile sensing module mounted on a multipurpose 9 DOF agricultural manipulator. With its innovative sensor arrangement we consider it to be a low-cost, easily manageable and efficient solution with a reasonable abstraction layer in comparison to complex torque sensing or tactile skins. The sensor provides information about the resulting force and torque. In the second part of our paper, the tactile information is used for minimizing contact forces while pursuing the end-effector tasks as long as reasonable. Hence, we present robust and efficient extensions to Resolved Motion Rate Control for real-time application. We introduce a general formulation providing control inputs in task-space, joint-space and nullspace. Thus, we design a suitable controller by feedback linearization and feed-forward terms. Results from real-world experiments show the potential of our approach. A discussion of the different control schemes completes the paper."
1961331,22736,23735,TCP position tolerances in joint torque minimizations,1998,"A new algorithm for link and path optimizations of manipulator arms is formulated. The algorithm considers precision in tool center point (TCP) positioning. A penalizing function is introduced to allow divergence from the desired TCP locations. The ever increasing operational demands of robots presuppose high power drives which tends to adversely affect the size of gearing and magnitudes of stress levels in the moving parts. In order to strike a balance between the conflicting demands of rapid task execution and the desire to limit available power, the algorithm was formulated using Newton-Euler dynamics to acquire the joint torques as functions of the parameters, which define the motion. By varying the parameters that define the motion (position, velocity, acceleration and link kinematics) while keeping the cycle time constant, it is possible to minimize the maximal value of the joint torques required for a sequential picking motion, transportation, placing motion and transportation back to the next picking location. Cycle optimizations are made for the Linkoping Flywheel Robot with only revolute joints (LFR), the new version of the Linkoping Flywheel Robot (LFRp) with one prismatic joint, the SCARA concept and a cylindrical robot concept. The simulations show that by tolerating a position error of 1 mm of the TCP, the required torque could be reduced significantly compared to that required for a position error of 0.1 mm. The conceptual robots exist in mathematical models in Matlab and SIMULINK."
612875,22736,23735,Path planning and guidance techniques for an autonomous mobile cleaning robot,1994,"In the past mobile robot research was often focused on various kinds of point-to-point transportation tasks. Mobile robot application in service tasks, however, requires quite different path planning and guidance approaches. This paper introduces and discusses in detail specific planning and guidance techniques for a mobile floor-cleaning robot. A kinematic and geometric model of the robot and the cleaning units as well as a 2D-map of the indoor environment are used for planning an appropriate cleaning path. The path is represented by a concatenation of two kinds of typical motion patterns. Each pattern is defined by a sequence of discrete cartesian intermediate goal frames. These frames represent position and orientation of the vehicle and must be translated into motion commands for the robot. The steps of this semi-automatic path planning system are illustrated by a typical cleaning environment. Vehicle guidance includes execution of the planned motion commands, estimation of the robot location, path tracking, as well as detection of and reaction to (isolated) obstacles. For location estimation a least-squares fitting of corresponding geometric contours from the 2D-environment map and geometric 2D-sensor data is used. Obstacle detection is accomplished by testing geometric 2D-sensor data to be part of the preplanned cleaning path. Path planning and parts of the developed vehicle guidance system have been tested with the experimental mobile robot MACROBE. Results reported in this paper demonstrate the efficiency of the described planning, location estimation and path tracking procedures in basic floor-cleaning tasks. >"
2704875,22736,23735,Group induction,2013,"Machine perception often requires a large amount of user-annotated data which is time-consuming, difficult, or expensive to collect. Perception systems should be easy to train by regular users, and this is currently far from the case. Our previous work, tracking-based semi-supervised learning [14], helped reduce the labeling burden by using tracking information to harvest new and useful training examples. However, [14] was designed for offline use; it assumed a fixed amount of unlabeled data and did not allow for corrections from users. In many practical robot perception scenarios we A) desire continuous learning over a long period of time, B) have a stream of unlabeled sensor data available rather than a fixed dataset, and C) are willing to periodically provide a small number of new training examples. In light of this, we present group induction, a new mathematical framework that rigorously encodes the intuition of [14] in an alternating optimization problem similar to expectation maximization (EM), but with the assumption that the unlabeled data comes in groups of instances that share the same hidden label. The mathematics suggest several improvements to the original heuristic algorithm, and make clear how to handle user interaction and streams of unlabeled data. We evaluate group induction on a track classification task from natural street scenes, demonstrating its ability to learn continuously, adapt to user feedback, and accurately recognize objects of interest."
962296,22736,23735,Design and compatibility of a high-performance actuation system for fMRI-based neuroscience studies,2010,"Haptic interfaces compatible with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are finding increasing interest as a tool to explore the neural correlates of human motor control and related dysfunctions. To achieve safety and MR compatibility, such devices have mainly relied on unconventional actuation methods suffering from limited bandwidth and non-linearities. This has resulted in complex control and restricted their use in applications involving fine and dynamic interaction with the hand and fingers. To address these limitations, we propose a concept for a shielded high-performance actuation system to be located inside the MR room, evaluate the effectiveness of the shielding and perform detailed MR compatibility tests. A conventional electromagnetic actuator is located within a steel shield to prevent mutual disturbance with magnetic fields of the scanner, which, together with power and control hardware, is placed within a Faraday cage with only a fiber-optical USB link to the control room. Detailed compatibility tests show that disturbing dynamic electromagnetic fields generated by the actuation system are well below the detectable threshold of the scanner, and actuator performance is not degraded by the MR environment. In combination with a light and stiff cable or rod transmission, the presented actuator technology, providing high transparency and force bandwidth, paves the way for fMRI-based neuroscience studies, e.g., to investigate the fine motor control of hand and fingers."
1388192,22736,23735,Underwater object tracking using electrical impedance tomography,2012,"Few effective technologies exist for sensing in dark or murky underwater situations. For this reason, we have been exploring the use of a novel biologically-inspired approach to non-visual sensing based on the detection of perturbations to a self generated electric field. This is used by many species of neotropical nocturnal freshwater fish. This approach, termed active electrosense, presents unique challenges for sensing and tracking of nearby objects. We explore two methods for estimating the velocity of objects through active electrosense. The first of these methods uses a simple cross-correlation method, which depends on the uniformity of the electric field. We show some of the ramifications of making this assumption for a self-generated field around a cylindrical pod-shaped sensor in a rectangular tank. We then evaluate the use of methods developed for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for localization and tracking. This is an unusual application of EIT in that typical applications involve surrounding the volume of interest (such as the thorax of humans) with sensor/emitters. Here, rather than this “outside in” approach, we are using EIT “inside out.” In simulation, we nonetheless find significant improvements in the accuracy of estimated velocity when using the EIT approach. Additionally, we demonstrate how EIT may be used for accurate position estimation. Under the conditions evaluated, the computation time for inversion is low enough to make its use feasible as a primary position and velocity estimator in an on- line system or as a secondary system to augment a computationally inexpensive estimator."

2243757,22736,23735,Switchblade: An agile treaded rover,2011,"A versatile unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) should be able to traverse rough terrain while retaining a small form factor for navigating confined spaces. Such a (patent pending) vehicle, dubbed Switchblade, is developed in the present work via an effective combination of a novel transforming mechanical design, capable onboard electronics, and advanced feedback control algorithms. A single chassis holds the actuators, sensors, electronics, and battery. Shafts protruding from either side of this chassis connect to tread assemblies. Rotation of this shaft causes the treads to advance for translational movement; rotation about this shaft causes the entire tread assembly to rotate with respect to the chassis. Vehicle orientation is estimated via onboard filtering of optical encoders and MEMS accelerometers and gyros. In its horizontal configuration, Switchblade operates as a differential-drive treaded platform. In its various upright configurations, Switchblade operates as a mobile inverted pendulum, capable of surmounting obstacles, including stairs, that would otherwise be impassable by a vehicle of its size. Design-for-manufacturing (DFM) and design-for-assembly (DFA) techniques are employed to reduce cost, part count, complexity, and assembly time without sacrificing system capabilities. Results from a working prototype are discussed. The resulting platform is well suited for a variety of socially-relevant applications, including reconnaissance, mine exploration, and search & rescue."

1984530,22736,23735,Instability Detection and Fall Avoidance for a Humanoid using Attitude Sensors and Reflexes,2006,"Humanoid robots are inherently unstable because their center of mass is high, compared to the support polygon's size. Bipedal walking currently works well only under controlled conditions with limited external disturbances. In less controlled dynamic environments, such as RoboCup soccer fields, external disturbances might be large. While some disturbances might be too large to prevent a fall, some disturbances can be dealt with by specific rescue behaviors. This paper proposes a method to detect instabilities that occur during omnidirectional walking. We model the readings of attitude sensors using sinusoids. The model takes the gait target vector into account. We estimate model parameters from a gait test sequence and detect deviations of the actual sensor readings from the model later on. These deviations are aggregated to an instability indicator that triggers one of two reflexes, based on indicator strength. For small instabilities the robot is slowing down, but continues walking. For stronger instabilities the robot stops and is brought into a stable posture with a low center of mass. Walking continues as soon as the instability disappears. We extensively evaluated our approach in simulation by disturbing the robot with a variety of impulses. The results indicate that our method is very effective. For smaller disturbances, the probability of a fall could be reduced to zero. Most of the medium-sized disturbances could also be rejected. For the evaluation with the real robot, we used a walking against a wall with different speeds and at various angles. Here the results show a similar outcome to the ones in the simulations"
2185180,22736,23735,Integrating Robotic Functions And Operator Supervision Using Petri Nets,1992,"Petri nets are a well established mod- elling technique for analyzing parallel systems. When coupled with an event-driven operatine system, Petri nets can provide an effective means for integrating and controlling the functions of distributed robotic appli- cations. Recent work has shown that Petri net graphs can also serve as remarkably intuitive operator inter- faces. In this paper the advantages for using Petri net as high-level controllers to coordinate robotic functions will be outlined; the considerations for designing Petri net controllers will be discussed; and simple Petri net structures for implementing an interface for operator supervision will be presented. I. INTRODUCTION The Theory of Intelligent Machines, as proposed in (8), describes a hierarchical organization of the functions of an autonomous robot into three levels: an Execution Level containing the hardware and basic control functions, a Coordination Level integrating the capabilities of the in- telligent machine (IM) across hardware systems, and an Organization Level providing higher-level planning and reasoning capabilities. Figure 1 illustrates this hierarchi- cal organization. An analytic formulation of the theory using information-theoretic measures of uncertainty for each level of the intelligent machine has been developed in recent years 9)(10). A long-term research goal of the ration (CIRSSE) is to attempt, guided by these theories, implementations of autonomous robots. In the past year at CIRSSE a computer architecture was developed that implements the lower two levels of the in- telligent machine (4). The architecture supports an event- Center for Intel I igent Robotic Systems for Space Explc-"
3001125,22736,23735,Multi-target detection and tracking from a single camera in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),2016,"Despite the recent flight control regulations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are still gaining popularity in civilian and military applications, as much as for personal use. Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting. Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multi-target detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great deal of research on object detection and tracking from a stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small UAVs from a moving camera. In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV. Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective transformation model and then identify distinctive points in the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal traits of each moving object through optical flow matching and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion patterns compared with the background. The performance is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV. Results show that our algorithm can effectively detect and track small UAVs with limited computing resources."
1580102,22736,23735,RAPOSA: Semi-Autonomous Robot for Rescue Operations,2006,"This work describes a semi-autonomous robot for rescue operations, nicknamed RAPOSA (FOX in English). The robot was designed and built to operate in outdoor environments hostile to the human presence, such as debris resulting from the collapse of built structures, and is targeted to the tele-operated detection of potential survivors using a set of specific sensors whose information is transmitted to a remote human operator. RAPOSA's mechanical structure is composed of a main body and a front body, whose locomotion is supported on tracked wheels, allowing motion even when the robot is upside down. The front body has variable tilting capabilities, providing means to overcome edges higher than the robot main body (e.g., when climbing a stair) and is also useful to grab the lower ground when only the main body has ground contact. This front body has one thermal camera and two web cameras installed. Additional sensors include gas, temperature and humidity sensors, Web cams, light diodes, microphone and loudspeaker. The robot uses wireless communications, with an option for tethered operation. The tether carries both power and communications, with an access point on its end, and can also be used to suspend the robot inside a deep hole. Docking and undocking the robot to the tether is accomplished remotely by the operator with the help of a camera located inside the robot, and represents the most innovative feature of RAPOSA"
1027535,22736,23735,A two party haptic guidance controller via a hard rein,2013,"In the case of human intervention in disaster response operations like indoor firefighting, where the environment perception is limited due to thick smoke, noise in the oxygen masks and clutter, not only limit the environmental perception of the human responders, but also causes distress. An intelligent agent (man/machine) with full environment perceptual capabilities is an alternative to enhance navigation in such unfavorable environments. Since haptic communication is the least affected mode of communication in such cases, we consider human demonstrations to use a hard rein to guide blindfolded followers with auditory distraction to be a good paradigm to extract salient features of guiding using hard reins. Based on numerical simulations and experimental systems identification based on demonstrations from eight pairs of human subjects, we show that, the relationship between the orientation difference between the follower and the guider, and the lateral swing patterns of the hard rein by the guider can be explained by a novel 3 rd  order auto regressive predictive controller. Moreover, by modeling the two party voluntary movement dynamics using a virtual damped inertial model, we were able to model the mutual trust between two parties. In the future, the novel controller extracted based on human demonstrations can be tested on a human-robot interaction scenario to guide a visually impaired person in various applications like fire fighting, search and rescue, medical surgery, etc."
2569205,22736,23735,Effective motion learning for a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling,2015,"We propose a method for realizing effective dynamic motion learning in a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling. Flexible-joint robots have recently attracted attention because of their adaptiveness, safety, and, in particular, dynamic motions. It is difficult to control robots that require dynamic motion. In past studies, attractors and oscillators were designed as motion primitives of an assumed task in advance. However, it is difficult to adapt to unintended environmental changes using such methods. To overcome this problem, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) that does not require predetermined parameters. In this research, we propose a method for facilitating effective learning. First, a robot learns simple motions via motor babbling, acquiring body dynamics using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Motor babbling is the process of movement that infants use to acquire their own body dynamics during their early days. Next, the robot learns additional motions required for a target task using the acquired body dynamics. For acquiring these body dynamics, the robot uses motor babbling with its redundant flexible joints to learn motion primitives. This redundancy implies that there are numerous possible motion patterns. In comparison to a basic learning task, the motion primitives are simply modified to adjust to the task. Next, we focus on the types of motions used in motor babbling. We classify the motions into two motion types, passive motion and active motion. Passive motion involves inertia without any torque input, whereas active motion involves a torque input. The robot acquires body dynamics from the passive motion and a means of torque generation from the active motion. As a result, we demonstrate the importance of performing prior learning via motor babbling before learning a task. In addition, task learning is made more efficient by dividing the motion into two types of motor babbling patterns."
691596,22736,23735,"Shrinkable, stiffness-controllable soft manipulator based on a bio-inspired antagonistic actuation principle",2014,"This paper explores a new hybrid actuation principle combining pneumatic and tendon-driven actuators for a soft robotic manipulator. The fusion of these two actuation principles leads to an overall antagonistic actuation mechanism whereby pneumatic actuation opposes tendon actuation - a mechanism commonly found in animals where muscles can oppose each other to vary joint stiffness. We are taking especially inspiration from the octopus who belongs to the class of Cephalopoda; the octopus uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles in its arms to achieve varied motion patterns; activating both sets of muscles, the octopus can control the arm stiffness over a wide range. Our approach mimics this behavior and achieves comparable motion patterns, including bending, elongation and stiffening. The proposed method combines the advantages of tendon-driven and pneumatic actuated systems and goes beyond what current soft, flexible robots can achieve: because the new robot structure is effectively an inflatable, sleeve, it can be pumped up to its fully inflated volume and, also, completely deflated and shrunk. Since, in the deflated state, it comprises just its outer “skin” and tendons, the robot can be compressed to a very small size, many times smaller when compared to its fully-inflated state. In this paper, we describe the mechanical structure of the soft manipulator. Proof-of-concept experiments focus on the robot's ability to bend, to morph from completely shrunk to entirely inflated as well as to vary its stiffness."
2552443,22736,23735,Inverse kinematics and reflex based controller for body-limb coordination of a salamander-like robot walking on uneven terrain,2015,"Search and rescue (SAR) missions are being carried out by several types of robots. They include ground, marine and air vehicles depending on the terrain and mission to be tackled. A particular niche for SAR activities are shallow waters. They present high difficultly for conventional ground or marine robots because of the mix of water and ground. Such an environment is difficult to be accessed for a robot without some built-in amphibious capabilities. Our lab has experience in the design of amphibious salamander-like robots. In order to consider whether these robots would be suited for SAR missions in shallow waters, a key requirement is the ability to tackle rough terrains. In this paper we present a control framework for a highly redundant salamander-like robot. It involves bio-inspired spine control, inverse kinematics-based limb control, proper limb-spine coordination, reflex mechanisms and attitude control. The framework is validated in a simulation and on the real robot. In both cases, the robot is used in two different configurations: with and without its tail, in order to investigate how the tail (which is necessary for swimming) affects ground locomotion. With this exploration, we aim to set the precedent for improving the problem of dynamic locomotion of salamander-like robots over unperceived rough terrain. Our results confirm that the design of reflexes like stumbling and extension, combined with an attitude controller, allows for the improving of the performance of the robot in a generic rough terrain which includes stairs, holes and bumps with several levels of complexity adjusted according to the robot dimensions."
1467066,22736,23735,Remote Control Based Hybrid-Structure Robot Design for Home Security Applications,2006,"Non-industrial robot applications are getting more popular than ever. Moving capability is one of the most important features of non-industrial robots. In general, the movements of non-industrial robots are categorized as wheeled and legged mechanical platforms. The wheeled platform performs stable and fast movement characteristics; however, it can not move on humpy grounds or cross small doorsills. Contrarily, the legged platform performs better adaptations to different types of ground conditions; nevertheless, the walking velocity and stability and the larger energy consumptions restrict the practical applications. In this paper, we present a hybrid-structure robot with humanoid and vehicle types to perform home security tasks. To achieve home security issues, the smoke and temperature detection sensors are mounted on the robot. At the same time, the CCD camera is mounted on the head of a robot to capture the guarded videos and to assist remote manipulations. The security robot is controlled remotely in terms of wireless manner. The proposed hybrid-structure robot behaves vehicle type in most of operation time to perform stable and fast movements and to reduce energy consumptions. When the robot enters humpy grounds or crosses small doorsills, the robot structure is changed as humanoid type to pass the non-flat grounds. Therefore, the proposed hybrid-structure security robot provides flexible adaptations to different types of ground conditions in home. Due to size limitations, the security robot can be used in regular apartments. Finally, a 50 cm in height security robot prototype is implemented in laboratory. The robot had been successfully tested for legged walking, wheeled driving, changing structures, cross small doorsills, remote manipulations, and remote monitoring of security functions"
2988825,22736,23735,A discrete dipole approximation approach to underwater active electrosense problems,2016,"Weakly electric fish use self-established electric field to sense the underwater environment that may be cluttered and turbid. Previous works on building artificial counterparts are limited to simplest cases, as no analytical solutions exist under complex boundary conditions. Universal numerical approaches like Finite Element Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) suffer from lengthy meshing process and heavily computational burden. In this paper, discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is widely used in light scattering and absorption problems, was for the first time proposed to be applied for underwater electrosense. This approach is lightweight, flexible and computationally efficient compared with FEM. It was simulated in electric fields excited by parallel-plate electrodes and spherical electrodes of a simplified robotic model. A constrained unscented Kalman filter (CUKF) was further utilized to localize the position and identify the size of an invading cube. Results comparison with FEM indicate the differences of a cuboidal object in two orthogonal positions were 7.10% and 10.46% respectively, and the difference in size was 11.82%. These results were achieved at a cost of less than 1% of the computational effort of the FEM. The proposed approach proved effective from the simulation results and laid a solid foundation for real-time underwater active electrosense in a more general environment."
1058637,22736,23735,Learning muscle activation patterns via nonlinear oscillators: Application to lower-limb assistance,2013,"Achieving coordination between a lower-limb exoskeleton and its user is challenging because walking is a dynamic process that involves multiple, precisely timed muscle activations. Electromyographical (EMG) feedback, in spite of its drawbacks, provides an avenue for assistance by enabling users to reduce the level of muscle activation required for walking. As an alternative to direct EMG feedback, we present a method for exoskeleton control based on learning the activation pattern of specific muscles during cyclic movements. Using the example of pendular leg motion, the torque profile of one muscle group (hip flexors) is learned in a two-step process. First, the estimated torque profile is indexed to the phase of the swing movement using an adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO). The profile is then encoded using linear weighted regression. In the algorithm's assistive mode, the learned profile is reconstructed by means of the AFO and without need for additional EMG input. The reconstructed profile is converted into a torque profile to be physically delivered by the exoskeleton. We tested our method on a single-actuator exoskeleton that assists the hip joint during stationary leg swing. The learning and assistance functions were built on top of an admittance controller that enhances the exoskeleton's mechanical transparency. Initial tests showed a high level of coordination, i.e. simultaneous positive work, between the subjects' hip flexor torque and the exoskeleton's assistive torque. This result opens the door for future studies to test the users' ability to reduce their muscle activation in proportion to the assistance delivered by the exoskeleton."
2901280,22736,23735,Force control on antagonistic Twist-drive Actuator robot,2016,"In recent researches relating to robotic fingers, a novel power transmission mechanism had been designed, and developed as Twist-drive Actuators or Twisted String Actuator systems (TSA). These actuation structures, state of the art, include compact designs, light-weight mechanical structures, inherent compliance, and variable gearing, resulting in the fabrication of anthropomorphic robotic hands. However, those studies mentioned position control of the joint, and focused on the control performance of the pulling forces of a twisted string. This paper, therefore, introduces a novel joint mechanism composed of an Antagonistically-twisted Round-belt Actuator (ARA), which is able to make rotating motion by means of contraction forces induced by twisting small-diameter elastic round-belts. A noteworthy point in this paper is that the ARA robot is extremely well-suited for contact force control, which is exerted on the tip of the single joint robot. First, we demonstrate the existence of hysteresis characteristics of static contraction forces induced by the round-belt twisting, in which three belts are simultaneously twisted at constant low-speed. In addition, there exists a stress relaxation phenomenon when strongly twisting the elastic round-belts. We reveal that such sorts of discontinuous and nonlinear properties do not influence control performance in either the contraction force on the belts or contact force on the tip of the robot. Finally, this paper clearly shows stable and accurate tracking performance of the contact force of the ARA robot. In these experiments, we newly develop a twin/triple-twisted round-belt structure for the agonist side actuator, thus enhancing the contact forces effectively."
2559714,22736,23735,A mosaicing approach for vessel visual inspection using a micro-aerial vehicle,2015,"Vessel maintenance entails periodic visual inspections of internal and external parts of the hull in order to detect the typical defective situations affecting metallic structures. Nowadays, robots are becoming more and more important regarding these inspection tasks, since they can collect the requested information and, thus, prevent humans from performing tedious, and even dangerous tasks because of places hard to reach for humans. A Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) fitted with vision cameras can be used as part of an automated or semi-automated inspection strategy. The resulting collection of individual images, however, does not permit the surveyor to get a global overview of the state of the surface under inspection, apart from the fact that the defects can be separated into different consecutive images. Image mosaicing can certainly help in this case. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel image mosaicing approach able to deal with this kind of scenarios. Our solution employs a graph-based registration method from which relevant topological relationships between (overlapping) images are found. This graph is built according to a visual index based on a Bag-of-Words (BoW) scheme making use of binary descriptors for speeding up the image description process. At the end of the paper, we report about the results of a number of experiments that validate our approach, including the outcome of defect detectors working directly over the mosaic."
2319868,22736,23735,Information-driven 6D SLAM based on ranging vision,2008,"This paper presents a novel solution for building three-dimensional dense maps in unknown and unstructured environment with reduced computational costs. This is achieved by giving the robot the dasiaintelligencepsila to select, out of the steadily collected data, the maximally informative observations to be used in the estimation of the robot location and its surroundings. We show that, although the actual evaluation of information gain for each frame introduces an additional computational cost, the overall efficiency is significantly increased by keeping the matrix compact. The noticeable advantage of this strategy is that the continuously gathered data is not heuristically segmented prior to be input to the filter. Quite the opposite, the scheme lends itself to be statistically optimal and is capable of handling large data sets collected at realistic sampling rates. The strategy is generic to any 3D feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm in the information form, but in the work presented here it is closely coupled to a proposed novel appearance-based sensory package. It consists of a conventional camera and a range imager, which provide range, bearing and elevation inputs to visual salient features as commonly used by three-dimensional point-based SLAM, but it is also particularly well adapted for lightweight mobile platforms such as those commonly employed for Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), chosen here to demonstrate the excellences of the proposed strategy."
1219502,22736,23735,Implementation of a musical performance interaction system for the Waseda Flutist Robot: Combining visual and acoustic sensor input based on sequential Bayesian filtering,2010,"The flutist robot WF-4RIV at Waseda University is able to play the flute at the level of an intermediate human player. So far the robot has been able to play in a statically sequenced duet with another musician, individually communicating only by keeping eye-contact. To extend the interactive capabilities of the flutist robot, we have in previous publications described the implementation of a Music-based Interaction System (MbIS). The purpose of this system is to combine information from the robot's visual and aural sensor input signal processing systems to enable musical communication with a partner musician. In this paper we focus on that part of the MbIS that is responsible for mapping the information from the sensor processing system to generate meaningful modulation of the musical output of the robot. We propose a two skill level approach to enable musicians of different ability levels to interact with the robot. When interacting with the flutist robot the device's physical capabilities / limitations need to be taken into account. In the beginner level interaction system the user's input to the robot is filtered in order to adjust it to the state of the robot's breathing system. The advanced level stage uses both the aural and visual sensor processing information. In a teaching phase the musician teaches the robot a tone sequence (by actually performing the sequence) that he relates to a certain instrument movement. In a performance phase, the musician can trigger these taught sequences by performing the according movements. Experiments to validate the functionality of the MbIS approach have been performed and the results are presented in this paper."
2627176,22736,23735,Experimental validation of a bio-inspired controller for dynamic walking with a humanoid robot,2015,"Bipedal walking with humanoid robots requires efficient real-time control. Nowadays, most bipedal robots require to ensure local stability at every instant in time, preventing them from achieving the impressive human walking skills. At the same time, bio-inspired walking controllers are emerging, though they are still mostly explored in simulation studies. However, porting these controllers to real hardware is needed to validate their use on real robots, as well as adapting them to face the world non-idealities. Here, we implemented one of them on a real humanoid robot, namely the COMAN, by conducting dynamic walking experiments. More precisely, we used a muscle-reflex model producing efficient and humanlike gaits. Starting from an off-line optimization performed in simulation, we present the controller implementation, focussing on the additional steps required to port it to real hardware. In our experimental results, we highlight some discrepancies between simulation and reality, together with possible controller extensions to fix them. Despite these differences, the real robot still managed to perform dynamic walking. On top of that, its gait exhibited stretched legs and foot roll at some points of the gait, two human walking features hard to achieve with most robot gaits. We present this on a 50 steps walk where the robot was free to move in the sagittal plane while lateral balance was provided by a human operator."
1035760,22736,23735,Measurement of the mechanical properties of living cell using micro hand and developed AFM system,2005,"In this paper, the mechanical properties of yeast cell are determined by means of the developed two-fingered micro hand and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The micro hand has excellent absolute positioning accuracy after the elaborated calibration, and is typically capable of obtaining less than several hundred nanometer of positioning accuracy by human tele-operation. The authors also developed an AFM system of our own composition. The AFM consists of a laser diode module, a cantilever, a 4-segment photodiode and output circuit. The task to measure the mechanical properties of cells include moving of the fingers from the home position to the target object (cell), then picking and grasping it, moving it to a target position (AFM tip), and finally pushing it against the cantilever tip. However, since it is difficult to stabilize the sample, the authors utilized the capillary phenomenon, i.e. the liquid inside the tube-shaped object ascends the inner wall in order to stabilize the sample strongly. And force-indentation relation was obtained applying a force to individual yeast cells by moving the sample to the cantilever tip. Force is automatically calculated from the cantilever deflection measured with a laser beam and a quadrature photodiode, while indentation is obtained from the difference between the movement of the micro hand and that of the cantilever tip caused by cantilever deflection. The mechanical properties of yeast cells is finally determined using the produced force-indentation curves, the Hertz model and FIEL (force indentation to equal limits) mapping, which is an analytical way for determining relative microelastic properties from force volumes of viscoelastic materials."
1138732,22736,23735,Position drift compensation in time domain passivity based teleoperation,2010,"The Time Domain Passivity Control Approach is gathering interest in the robotics field. Simplicity and flexibility and the fact that system design emerges from ideal cases make it a powerful stability tool for teleoperation systems. Communication time delay is an inherent attribute of nearly every realistic teleoperation system. Unless the communication channel guarantees transmission delays of less than the system sampling time, the delay must be considered in the design in order to guarantee stability and satisfy a desired degree of performance. In previous work it has been shown how passivity can be considered in the time domain and how control rules are derived from it in order to dissipate the energy produced by the delayed communication. However, a weakness of these approaches is the impossibility of observing the exact amount of energy stored in the communication channel due to its delayed nature. A passive estimation is therefore needed which outcomes in an over-dissipation and in turn impacts on transparency. In constrained communications over-dissipation may become apparent in the form of a non-neglectful position drift between master and slave. This paper tackles the over-dissipative behavior of the Passivity Controller by resembling the energetic behavior of an ideal communication, i.e. where no delay is present and the transmission is lossless. Thus, the communication channel is not just controlled to be passive, as has been the case up to now, but also lossless. Energy can be dissipated to prevent activity, but activity can be also produced to prevent dissipative behaviors. The approach is sustained with experimental results."
1036232,22736,23735,A soft-bodied fluid-driven amoeboid robot inspired by plasmodium of true slime mold,2010,"Animals exhibit astoundingly adaptive and supple locomotion under real world constraints. In order to endow robots with similar capabilities, we must implement many degrees of freedom, equivalent to animals, into the robots' bodies. For taming many degrees of freedom, the concept of autonomous decentralized control plays a pivotal role. However, a systematic way of designing such autonomous decentralized control system is still missing. Aiming at understanding the principles that underlie animals' locomotion, in our early studies, we focused on plasmodium of true slime mold, a primitive living organism, and extracted a design scheme for autonomous decentralized control system. In order to demonstrate the relevance of this design scheme, this paper presents a soft-bodied fluid-driven amoeboid robot inspired by plasmodium of true slime mold. The significant features of this robot are twofold: (1) the robot has fluidic circuit (i.e., cylinders and nylon tubes filled with fluid) and truly soft and deformable body stemming from real-time tunable springs, the former serves as protoplasm and the latter is used for elastic actuators; and (2) a fully decentralized control using coupled oscillators with completely local sensory feedback mechanism is realized by exploiting the long-distance physical interaction between the body parts stemming from the law of conservation of protoplasmic mass. The experimental results show that this robot exhibits truly supple locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure. The results obtained are expected to shed new light on design scheme for autonomous decentralized control system."
2495963,22736,23735,Using eigenposes for lossless periodic human motion imitation,2009,"Programming a humanoid robot to perform an action that takes the robot's complex dynamics into account is a challenging problem. Traditional approaches typically require highly accurate prior knowledge of the robot's dynamics and environment in order to devise complex control algorithms for generating a stable dynamic motion. Training using human motion capture is an intuitive and flexible approach to programming a robot but directly applying motion capture data to a robot usually results in dynamically unstable motion. Optimization using high-dimensional motion capture data in the humanoid full-body joint-space is also typically intractable. In previous work, we proposed an approach that uses dimensionality reduction to achieve tractable imitation-based learning in humanoids without the need for a physics-based dynamics model. This work was based on a 3-D “eigenpose” representation. However, for some motion patterns, using only three dimensions for eigenposes is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method for motion optimization based on high-dimensional eigenpose data. A one-dimensional computationally efficient motion-phase optimization method is implemented along with a newly developed cylindrical coordinate transformation technique for hyperdimensional subspaces. This results in a fast learning algorithm and very accurate motion imitation. We demonstrate the new algorithm on a Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot model in a dynamic simulator and show that a dynamically stable sidestep motion can be successfully learned by imitating a human demonstrator."
2306969,22736,23735,Morpho: A self-deformable modular robot inspired by cellular structure,2008,"We present a modular robot design inspired by the creation of complex structures and functions in biology via deformation. Our design is based on the Tensegrity model of cellular structure, where active filaments within the cell contract and expand to control individual cell shape, and sheets of such cells undergo large-scale shape change through the cooperative action of connected cells. Such deformations play a role in many processes, e.g. early embryo shape change and lamprey locomotion. Modular robotic systems that replicate the basic deformable multicellular structure have the potential to quickly generate large-scale shape change and create dynamic shapes to achieve different global functions. Based on this principle, our design includes four different modular components: (1) active links, (2) passive links, (3) surface membranes, and (4) interfacing cubes. In hardware implementation, we show several self-deformable structures that can be generated from these components, including a self-deformable surface, expandable cube, terrain-adaptive bridge [C.-H. Yu et al., 2007]. We present experiments to demonstrate that such robotic structures are able to perform real time deformation to adapt to different environments. In simulation, we show that these components can be configured into a variety of bio-inspired robots, such as an amoeba-like robot and a tissue-inspired material. We argue that self-deformation is well-suited for dynamic and sensing-adaptive shape change in modular robotics."
631160,22736,23735,A whole-body pose taxonomy for loco-manipulation tasks,2015,"Exploiting interaction with the environment is a promising and powerful way to enhance stability of humanoid robots and robustness while executing locomotion and manipulation tasks. Recently some works have started to show advances in this direction considering humanoid locomotion with multi-contacts, but to be able to fully develop such abilities in a more autonomous way, we need to first understand and classify the variety of possible poses a humanoid robot can achieve to balance. To this end, we propose the adaptation of a successful idea widely used in the field of robot grasping to the field of humanoid balance with multi-contacts: a whole-body pose taxonomy classifying the set of whole-body robot configurations that use the environment to enhance stability. We have revised criteria of classification used to develop grasping taxonomies, focusing on structuring and simplifying the large number of possible poses the human body can adopt. We propose a taxonomy with 46 poses, containing three main categories, considering number and type of supports as well as possible transitions between poses. The taxonomy induces a classification of motion primitives based on the pose used for support, and a set of rules to store and generate new motions. We present preliminary results that apply known segmentation techniques to motion data from the KIT whole-body motion database. Using motion capture data with multi-contacts, we can identify support poses providing a segmentation that can distinguish between locomotion and manipulation parts of an action."
678164,22736,23735,Obstacle avoidance strategy based on adaptive potential fields generated by an electronic stick,2005,"In our previous work, an obstacle avoidance algorithm, which used potential fields and a similar strategy to that adopted by a blind person to avoid obstacles whilst walking, was proposed. The problem analyzed consists of an AGV (autonomous guided vehicle) which moves within an office environment with a known floor plan and uses an electronic stick made up of infrared sensors to detect unknown obstacles in its path. Initially, a global potential navigation function, defined for each room in the floor plan, incorporates information about the dimensions of the room and the position of the door which the AGV must use to leave the room. Whilst the AGV moves, this global potential navigation function is properly modified to incorporate information about any newly detected obstacle. The main interesting aspect of the proposed approach is that the potential function adaptation involves very low computational burden allowing for the use of ultra-fast AGVs. Other distinctive features of the algorithm are that it is free from local minima, the obstacles can have any shape, low cost sensors can be used to detect obstacles and an appropriate balance is achieved between the use of the global and the local approaches for collision avoidance. Our present work is a refinement of this strategy that allows for an automatic real time adaptation of the algorithm's parameters. Now, the algorithm's functioning requires only that the minimum distance at which the AGV can approach an obstacle (i.e. the closest it can get to any obstacle) is defined a priori. Aspects of the real implementation of the algorithm are also discussed."
1781733,22736,23735,FAS A flexible antagonistic spring element for a high performance over actuated hand,2011,"In robotic hands design tendon driven systems have been considered for years. The main advantage is a small end effector inertia e.g. a light, small hand with high dynamics due to remote actuators. To protect the actuators from impact in unknown environments a compliant mechanism can be used. It absorbs energy during an impact or saves energy to enhance the joint dynamics. In this paper an antagonistic tendon mechanism is presented. It fits 38 times in the DLR Hand Arm System forearm and enables is adapted to the different finger joints and different tendon lengths. A magnetic sensor was developed for the force measurement of the tendons. Finally, the calibration and the robustness are demonstrated through a set of experiments. the tendon has no load. Moreover, it results in an increased tendon inertia. The points shown above and the creep of the tendons (Fig. 3) lead to the choice of an antagonistic configuration. Based on the mechanism shown in (6), a new mechanism that fits 38 times into the forearm has been designed. It can be tuned to the different needed force to deflection behaviors by modifying the equilibrium point, the spring rate and the spring position regarding the lever. In this paper the development of a highly integrated variable stiffness element is presented. In the first section, the mechanism is presented along with the constraints it has to fulfill. A second section presents the test system used to verify and calibrate the sensors. Finally, the third section gives primilinary results on the tendon force control performance, that can be achieved using this sensor."
1321332,22736,23735,Eliciting collective behaviors through automatically generated environments,2013,"Many groups of agents exhibit emergent collective behaviors. The environment in which the agents operate is one determinant of the resulting behaviors. This work shows how automatic enumeration of environments enables exploration of various collective behaviors that perform useful group functions (e.g. segregation, corralling, shape formation). Although groups of agents, such as mobile robots, can be manipulated through explicit control, this study shows that these systems can be usefully manipulated without resorting to such imperative means. This method has obvious uses for heterogeneous robot systems, especially those which include large numbers of simple agents. The method introduced is general, in that it takes as input: (1) algorithmic specifications of the environment generation, (2) a black-box model of the individual agent's control laws, and (3) a mathematical description of the task objective. To show the validity of the proposed method this investigation studies two behaviors (splitting and corralling) for three commonly studied motion models, including the well known Reynold's model. Simulations and physical multi-robot trials show that automatically generated environments can elicit pre-specified behaviors from a group of individual agents. Additionally, this work investigates the effects of a group's emergent properties on the ability to elicit the specified behavior via the environment. The findings suggest that automatically exploring environments can lead to better exploration and understanding of collective behaviors, including the identification of previously unknown emergent behaviors."
2423319,22736,23735,"A Delay-tolerant, Potential field-based, Network Implementation of an Integrated Navigation System",2006,"Intelligent space (iSpace) is a large scale mechatronics system. It is a multidisciplinary effort whose aim is to produce a network structure and components that are capable of integrating sensors, actuators, DSP, communication, and control algorithms in a manner that suits time-sensitive applications including real-time navigation and/or obstacle avoidance. There are many challenges that must be overcome in order to put such a distributed, heterogeneous system together. This paper deals with one of these issues, i.e. the adverse effect of network and processing delays on the system. Here a delay-resistant sensory motor module for navigating a differential drive unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in a cluttered environment is suggested. The module consists of an early vision edge detection stage, a harmonic potential field (HPF) planner, a network based quadratic curve fitting controller and gain schedule middleware, (GSM). Though the different techniques used to implement the navigation system have been well-studied as independent modules, the contribution in this paper is the way all these different modules are integrated together for the first time to create an efficient structure for a network based integrated navigation system. The structure of this module and its components are described. Thorough experimental results along with performance assessment comparing the suggested structure to a previous implementation of iSpace are also provided"
1255396,22736,23735,A practical obstacle detection system for autonomous orchard vehicles,2012,"Safe robot navigation in tree fruit orchards requires that the vehicle be capable of robustly navigating between rows of trees and turning from one aisle to another; that the vehicle be dynamically stable, especially when carrying workers; and that the vehicle be able to detect obstacles on its way and adjust its speed accordingly. In this paper we address the latter, in particular the problem of detecting people and apple bins in the aisles between rows. One of our requirements is that the obstacle avoidance subsystem shouldn't add to the robot's hardware cost, so as to keep the acquisition cost to growers as low as possible. Therefore, we confine ourselves to solutions that use only the sensor suite already installed on the robot for navigation-in our case, a laser scanner, low-cost inertial measurement unit, and steering and wheel encoders. Our methodology is based on the classification and clustering of registered 3D points as obstacles. In the current implementation, obstacle avoidance takes in 3D point clouds collected in apple orchards and generates an off-line assessment of obstacle position. Tests conducted at our experimental orchard-like environment in Pittsburgh and an actual apple orchard in Washington state indicate that the method is able to detect people and bins located along the vehicle path. Stretch tests indicate that it is also capable of dealing with objects as small as 15 cm tall as long as they aren't covered by grass, and to detect people crossing the aisles at walking speed."
2039609,22736,23735,Automatic selection of task spaces for imitation learning,2009,"Previous work [1] shows that the movement representation in task spaces offers many advantages for learning object-related and goal-directed movement tasks through imitation. It allows to reduce the dimensionality of the data that is learned and simplifies the correspondence problem that results from different kinematic structures of teacher and robot. Further, the task space representation provides a first generalization, for example wrt. differing absolute positions, if bi-manual movements are represented in relation to each other. Although task spaces are widely used, even if they are not mentioned explicitly, they are mostly defined a priori. This work is a step towards an automatic selection of task spaces. Observed movements are mapped into a pool of possibly even conflicting task spaces and we present methods that analyze this task space pool in order to acquire task space descriptors that match the observation best. As statistical measures cannot explain importance for all kinds of movements, the presented selection scheme incorporates additional criteria such as an attention-based measure. Further, we introduce methods that make a significant step from purely statistically-driven task space selection towards model-based movement analysis using a simulation of a complex human model. Effort and discomfort of the human teacher is being analyzed and used as a hint for important task elements. All methods are validated with real-world data, gathered using color tracking with a stereo vision system and a VICON motion capturing system."
2432109,22736,23735,A Fast Damped Least-squares Solution To Manipulator Inverse Kinematics And Singularities Prevention,1992,"In this article the inverse kinematics problem for robot manipulators is considered under an inexact context; and a fast procedure for its solution and pseudoinverse robustness is presented. The approach is based on solving the linear system based on the symmetric matrix JJT+pl (where, J and I are the Jacobian and the identity matrix respectively, and p is a damping factor) by a Gaussian elimination process that takes into account the matrix symmetry, and automatically evaluating some simple parameters. These parameters are used in either one of two original schemes, which are theoretically justifiable, that are also proposed for the appropiate evaluation of the damping factor. In the first scheme an upper bound for the condition number of the matrix JJT+pl, in terms of some of the calculated parameters is used. Alternatively, in the second scheme the sufficiency condition for the rank preservation of the Jacobian developed in [5] is considered. First, an upper bound for the pseudoinverse matrix p, in terms of some of the evaluated parameters is found. Then, it is easily shown that the sufficiency condition for rank preservation can be established in terms of this bound and on the 00 norm of the Jacobian rate of change matrix. Furthermore, and as important, here it is also shown how to properly implement these schemes, in particular the one based on an upper bound for the pseudoinverse, in conjuction with a recently developed approach [4] for the singularities prevention of redundant manipulators. The developed algorithms are tested on the simulation of a planar redundant manipulator. From the results obtained it is observed that the proposed approach (in terms of efficiency, robustness and ability to prevent large joint speeds) compares favorably with the approaches using a Gaussian elimination procedure and with pseudoinverse robustness based on a manipulability measure. 2.

1988367,22736,23735,Imitation Learning System to Assist Human Task Interactively,2006,"This paper proposes an imitation learning system to generate trajectories by which a robot supports a human with close physical assistance adapting to human movements and daily life environments. The proposed system is composed of 1) division algorithms, 2) learning algorithms and 3) assistance algorithms. 1) In division algorithms, the system measures time series of human task execution data and divides them into multiple motion segments automatically. This division is based on standard deviations of motion errors between measured trajectories and an ideal trajectory where the ideal trajectory is mean of all measured human trajectories and is expected to achieve the purpose of human task successfully. Since an important motion parameter is paid attention to by the human and has small standard deviation of errors, series of measured data are divided into segment motions at the points where the importance of parameters changes suddenly. Thus this division is guaranteed to accord with human attention. 2) In learning algorithms, the system learns trajectories with dynamic neural network (DNN). Since the DNN has convergence, generated trajectories can converge to an ideal trajectory. The importance of each parameter, in other words how much attention human pays to the parameter, is evaluated as how small the standard deviation of errors is. The DNN learns trajectories reflecting the evaluated importance of parameters to accord with human feeling. 3) In assistance algorithms, the system judges when to start assistance by the assumption of multiplied errors of motion parameters by the respective importance. In assistance algorithms, the system also connects generated trajectories of motion segments smoothly. An experiment to support human drink task was performed successfully where the proposed system judged not only when to start assistance to the task but also execute assistance when a cup was about to incline too much not to spill water"
644278,22736,23735,The RobotChallenge - A research inspired practical lecture,2012,"This paper presents a new university course combining theoretical lectures with a robot competition. The main intention is to offer a practical course including hands-on experiences being close to current research topics in the field of mobile robotics. For this purpose, a commercial mobile robot is equipped with state of the art sensors, allowing autonomous execution of manipulation tasks. The course consists of three thematical sections. At the beginning of each, lectures provide the theoretical background. On this basis, the participants are addressed to develop algorithms and to solve specific tasks, delivered in homework packages, self-reliantly or in a team. Finally, the developed software components need to be merged to solve a predefined scenario, e.g. autonomous part handling. At the end of a thematic section, students demonstrate their developed solutions within a challenge and explain their approaches in a presentation. Starting with teleoperation and object recognition, the RobotChallenge ends up with navigation in unknown terrain. Besides others, the participants acquire soft-skills, such as project and team management. Being carried out for the first time in winter term 2011/2012, the RobotChallenge successfully promotes profound understanding of mobile robotics that is applied during practical experiences. It turns out, that aspiring to win competions lead to a high motivation of the students w.r.t. development of appropriate solutions."
1229459,22736,23735,A relative-change-based hierarchical taxonomy for cantilever-snap assembly verification,2012,"Snap assembly automation remains a challenging task. While progress is being made in localization of parts, force controllers, and control strategies, little work has been done to help the robot reason about its current state, such that if necessary, the robot can assume corrective actions to accomplish the task. Error prone situations caused by the unexpected motion of parts, localization errors, jamming or wedging, cannot be solved by force controllers alone. For this reason we propose a snap assemblies verification system for cantilever-snap fasteners. The verification works in concert with a control strategy that makes use of constraint designs embedded in the snap parts' physical design. The constrained assembly motion generates similar sensory-signal patterns across trials that facilitates force signal discrimination into higher level abstractions of intuitive behavior. This work's contribution is the design of a hierarchical taxonomy for cantilever-snap verification based on increasingly abstract layers that encode relative-change in the task's force signatures. A five-layered taxonomy is built on the concept that relative-change patterns can be classified through a small category set and aided by contextual information. The verification system yielded human apropos intuitive categorizations of task behavior for every state and effectively determined the assembly result. This simple yet effective approach will be expanded to perform probabilistic online system verification to aid in fault tolerance and the automation of cantilever-based snap assemblies."
1560842,22736,23735,Surface sensor networks for Underwater Vehicle positioning with bearings-only measurements,2012,"There is increasing interest in the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to substantially improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation. A key element in the operation of certain classes of AUVs is the availability of good underwater positioning systems to localize one or more vehicles simultaneously based on information received on-board a support ship or a set of autonomous surface vehicles. In an interesting operational scenario, the set of autonomous surface vehicles carries a network of acoustic units that measure the elevation and azimuth angles between the target and each of the receivers. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network at the ocean surface that will maximize the angle-related information available for underwater target positioning. It is assumed that the angle measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Using the Cramer-Rao lower bound inequality, the trace of the inverse of the Fisher Information matrix (also called the Cramer-Rao Bound matrix) for the problem at hand is used to determine the sensor configuration that yields the minimum possible covariance of any unbiased target estimator. It is shown that the optimal configuration lends itself to an interesting geometrical interpretation and that the spreading of the sensor configuration depends explicitly on the intensity of the measurement noise and the target depth. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived."
1992668,22736,23735,Intelligent robot hand control system using a tailorable parallel computer concept,1994,"Presents a control system for the intelligent force control of multifingered robot grips. The multilevel system architecture combines both a fuzzy-based adaptation level and a neural-based one with a conventional PID-controller that allows autonomous performance of fine manipulations of an object. Two kinds of fuzzy controllers are presented. They use a decision making logic which expresses the a priori knowledge about the grasp force behaviour inside the friction cones and the necessary reactions regarding the criterion for grip stability. A neural controller, based on a Hooke-Jeeves optimisation approach, has been developed as well. The neural control algorithm is implemented by a three-layered backpropagation neural network. The neural and fuzzy controllers can be used separately or in parallel. In the last case the neural controller can be on-line trained using the input-output information from the fuzzy one. A computer based simulation system for the peg-in-hole insertion task is developed to analyse and to compare the capabilities of both control algorithms. The demands of flexibility and real-time control of the implementation of the control system are suited by a tailorable parallel computer concept. The two basic ideas of the concept are to set up each processing element individually for its application and connect these elements with different communicational methods according to the applicational demands. As this happens before runtime the concept is called static flexibility and is implemented using a new mechanical computer structure. >"
1646518,22736,23735,Utilizing compliance to manipulate doors with unmodeled constraints,2010,"Increasingly, robots are being applied to challenges in human environments such as soldier and disability assistance, household chores, and bomb disposal. To maximize a robot's capabilities within these dynamic and uncertain environments, robots must be able to manipulate objects with unknown constraints, including opening and closing doors, cabinets, and drawers. Practicality suggests that these tasks be done at or near human speed. A simple and low cost method is proposed to achieve these ends - utilizing joint compliance to resolve forces non-tangent to the path of travel. In this paper, joint compliance is achieved by means of a clutch mechanism located in line with the manipulator joint motors. When an object is to be moved, the motors are disengaged from the joints using the clutch, thus allowing the joints to move freely with the object while force is applied by the mobility platform. This enables the robot to move an object within its constraints without the need for a precise forcing vector, minimizing sensing needs as well as computation time. Other implementations of the technique are also possible, including use of inverse dynamics, back-drivable motors, and/or actively controlled slip clutches for gravity and friction compensation. The effectiveness and robustness of this approach are demonstrated through kinematic analysis, dynamic simulation, and physical experimentation on three differently sized doors and a drawer."
2635382,22736,23735,High-frequency MAV state estimation using low-cost inertial and optical flow measurement units,2015,"This paper develops a simple and low-cost method for 3D, high-rate vehicle state estimation, specially designed for free-flying Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). We fuse observations from inertial measurement units and the recently appeared low-cost optical flow smart cameras. These smart cameras integrate a sonar altimeter, a triaxial gyrometer and an optical flow sensor, and directly provide metric ego-motion information in the form of body velocities and altitude. Compared to state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry methods, we are able to drastically reduce the computational load in the main processor unit, and obtain an accurate estimation of the vehicle state at a high update rate of 100Hz. We thus extend the current use of these smart cameras from hovering purposes to odometry estimation. In order to propose a simple algorithmic solution, we investigate the performances of two Kalman filters, in the extended and error-state flavors, alongside a large number of algorithm variations, using simulations and real experiments with precise ground-truth. We observe that the marginal performance gain attained with these algorithm improvements does not pay for the effort of implementing them. We conclude that a classical EKF in its simplest form is sufficient for providing motion estimates that coherently exploit the available measurements."
1184438,22736,23735,An exoskeleton robot for human arm movement study,2005,"A new experimental platform permits us to study a novel variety of issues of human motor control, particularly full 3D movements involving the major seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the human arm. We incorporate a seven DOF robot exoskeleton, and minimize weight and inertia through gravity, Coriolis, and inertia compensation, such that subjects' arm movements are largely unaffected by the manipulandum. Torque perturbations can be individually applied to any or all seven joints of the human arm, thus creating novel dynamic environments, or force fields, for subjects to respond and adapt to. Our first study investigates a joint space force field where the shoulder velocity drives a disturbing force in the elbow joint. Results demonstrate that subjects learn to compensate for the force field within about 100 trials, and, from the strong presence of aftereffects when removing the field in some randomized catch trials, that an inverse dynamics, or internal model, of the force field is formed by the nervous system. Interestingly, while after learning, hand trajectories return to baseline, joint space trajectories remained changed in response to the field, indicating that, besides learning a model of the force field, the nervous system also chose to exploit the null space to minimize the effects of the force field on the realization of the endpoint trajectory plan. We discuss applications of these results in the light of current theories of robotic control, including inverse kinematics and optimal control."
3001026,22736,23735,Expressive navigation and Local Path-Planning of independent steering autonomous systems,2016,"This paper presents a novel Local-Path Planning approach for an independent four-wheel steering (I4WS) mobile base. The approach smoothly drives and rotates the platform while still following a given path and avoiding obstacles. I4WS vehicles are omnidirectional vehicles, similar to shopping carts, if one neglects the time needed to steer the wheels. However, due to the danger of mechanical parts breaking while actuating the wheels, they are commonly controlled in a stop-and-go fashion, where the vehicle stops to turn its wheels perpendicular to a desired instantaneous center of curvature (ICC) before starting to move again. The approach overcomes this limitation and ensures an ICC-based kinematic constraint during continuous motion using a flat-input controller running at 100 Hz. Therefore, the trajectory of the ICC is both predictable and suitable for model predictive control (MPC). The MPC implemented generates optimized collision-free trajectories of up to several meters ahead at 10 Hz, given a set of points along a path and laser contour readings. Furthermore, the planner realized here is able to deal with additional constraints such as the vehicle's view direction to focus on attention points while driving. Experimental results highlight the capabilities of the approach on a simulated robot, using GazeboSim, and demonstrate its applicability for the field of service robotics."
1678658,22736,23735,Toward a modular soft sensor-embedded glove for human hand motion and tactile pressure measurement,2014,"The ability to measure human hand motions and interaction forces is critical to improving our understanding of manual gesturing and grasp mechanics. This knowledge serves as a basis for developing better tools for human skill training and rehabilitation, exploring more effective methods of designing and controlling robotic hands, and creating more sophisticated human-computer interaction devices which use complex hand motions as control inputs. This paper presents work on the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a soft sensor-embedded glove which measures both hand motion and contact pressures during human gesturing and manipulation tasks. We design an array of liquid-metal embedded elastomer sensors to measure up to hundreds of Newtons of interaction forces across the human palm during manipulation tasks and to measure skin strains across phalangeal and carpal joints for joint motion tracking. The elastomeric sensors provide the mechanical compliance necessary to accommodate anatomical variations and permit a normal range of hand motion. We explore methods of assembling this soft sensor glove from modular, individually fabricated pressure and strain sensors and develop design guidelines for their mechanical integration. Experimental validation of a soft finger glove prototype demonstrates the sensitivity range of the designed sensors and the mechanical robustness of the proposed assembly method, and provides a basis for the production of a complete soft sensor glove from inexpensive modular sensor components."
1775554,22736,23735,Situation awareness via sensor-equipped eyeglasses,2013,"New smartphone technologies are emerging which combine head-mounted displays (HMD) with standard functions such as receiving phone calls, emails, and helping with navigation. This opens new opportunities to explore cyber robotics algorithms (robotics sensors and human motor plant). To make these devices more adaptive to the environmental conditions, user behavior, and user preferences, it is important to allow the sensor-equipped devices to efficiently adapt and respond to user activities (e.g., disable incoming phone calls in an elevator, activate video recording while car driving). This paper hence presents a situation awareness system (SAS) for head-mounted smartphones. After collecting data from inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes), and video data (camera), SAS performs activity classification in three steps. Step 1 transforms inertial sensor data into a head orientation-independent and stable normalized coordinate system. Step 2 extracts critical features (statistical, physical, GIST). Step 3 classifies activities (Naive Bayes classifier), distinguishes between environments (Support Vector Machine), and finally combines both results (Hidden Markov Model) for further improvement. SAS has been implemented on a sensor-equipped eyeglasses prototype and achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities."
636434,22736,23735,Online and markerless motion retargeting with kinematic constraints,2008,"Transferring motion from a human demonstrator to a humanoid robot is an important step toward developing robots that are easily programmable and that can replicate or learn from observed human motion. The so called motion retargeting problem has been well studied and several off-line solutions exist based on optimization approaches that rely on pre-recorded human motion data collected from a marker-based motion capture system. From the perspective of human robot interaction, there is a growing interest in online and marker-less motion transfer. Such requirements have placed stringent demands on retargeting algorithms and limited the potential use of off-line and pre-recorded methods. To address these limitations, we present an online task space control theoretic retargeting formulation to generate robot joint motions that adhere to the robotpsilas joint limit constraints, self-collision constraints, and balance constraints. The inputs to the proposed method include low dimensional normalized human motion descriptors, detected and tracked using a vision based feature detection and tracking algorithm. The proposed vision algorithm does not rely on markers placed on anatomical landmarks, nor does it require special instrumentation or calibration. The current implementation requires a depth image sequence, which is collected from a single time of flight imaging device. We present online experimental results of the entire pipeline on the Honda humanoid robot - ASIMO."
1487989,22736,23735,Novel haptic mouse system for holistic haptic display and potential of vibrotactile stimulation,2005,"This paper describes a novel haptic mouse system which conveys kinesthetic and tactile information simultaneously in virtual environments. The haptic mouse system can provide 2-DOF translational force feedback, vibration, normal pressure, skin stretch and thermal feedback, all of which are important physical quantities of sensing object's shape, stiffness and surface properties. The system can simulate small scale shapes and roughness of surface textures using cutaneous cues generated by individual drives of a 6/spl times/8 pin array. Since thermal differences among surfaces of virtual objects is one of dominant factors in perceiving texture, a thermal feedback unit composed of a heat conduction plate and a temperature sensor is also embedded into the tactile display system. The developed system can be used as a testbed in psychophysical study on tactile perception. We have investigated the influence of the frequency variation on perceived roughness using the haptic mouse system since vibrotaction has been considered as a key factor affecting perception of fine textures by physiology researchers. In order to find out the relation of roughness and vibration, two psychophysical experiments have been performed. The correlation between the vibration frequency and the texture shows that there are certain transitions of perceived roughness. The experimental results yield that the vibrating stimulus is more effective for displaying a fine surface than static displacement display, and it shows a possibility to display finer texture, exceeding the physical limitation of the device."
2087460,22736,23735,Calibration of vision systems based on pseudo-random patterns,2009,"Solving visual features' correspondence and dealing with missing data are two factors of limitations for points registration techniques. To tackle this problem, we conceived a pattern, primarily designed for structured lighting vision systems, which may also be used for camera calibration purposes. The pattern design previously presented in [1] provides a huge of benefits. Among them, we firstly present a new calibration technique of a structured lighting system and secondly an automatic distortion compensation based on a printed pattern. These two well-known issues are very useful in 3D vision-based metrology with range data, for instance for model-based visual robot control, especially when the model is incrementally built with a real-time 3D reconstruction of moving surfaces. Perhaps, one of the most significant profit with a high Hamming distance pattern is the ability to reliably decode its projected individual elements even if several of items are missing, as it greatly extends the range of measurements volume. A technique which solves the distortion parameters by means of a robust M-estimator algorithm is presented. It uses a printed pattern and it allows the distortion be corrected with a single view and without the computation of other (intrinsic/extrinsic) parameters, even in presence of occlusions. Experimental results, in one hand by means of a printed pattern for the distortion compensation of a rigid endoscope and on the other hand by means of a projected pattern for the calibration of the structured lighting system, show very good performance for the 3-D reconstruction."
2241134,22736,23735,EMG-based teleoperation of a robot arm using low-dimensional representation,2007,"In robot teleoperation scenarios, the interface between the user and the robot is undoubtedly of high importance. In this paper, electromyographic (EMG) signals from muscles of the human upper limb are used as the control interface between the user and a remote robot arm. The proposed interface consists of surface EMG electrodes, placed at the user's skin at several locations on the arm, letting the user's upper limb free of bulky interface sensors or machinery usually found in conventional teleoperation systems. The motion of the human upper limb entails the activation of a large number of muscles (i.e. more than 30 muscles, not including finger movements). Moreover, the human arm has 7 degrees of freedom (DoFs) suggesting a wide variety of motions. Therefore, the mapping between these two high-dimensional data (i.e. the muscles activation and the motion of the human arm), is an extremely challenging issue. For this reason, a novel methodology is proposed here, where the mapping between the muscles activation and the motion of the user's arm is done in a low-dimensional space. Each of the high-dimensional input (muscle activation) and output (arm motion) vectors, is transformed into an individual low-dimensional space, where the mapping between the two low-dimensional vectors is then feasible. A state-space model is trained to map the low-dimensional representation of the muscles activation to the corresponding motion of the user's arm. After training, the state-space model can decode the human arm motion in real time with high accuracy, using only EMG recordings. The estimated motion is used to control a remote anthropomorphic robot arm. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed through real-time experiments including motion in two-dimensional (2D) space."
2599527,22736,23735,A reduced-complexity description of arm endpoint stiffness with applications to teleimpedance control,2015,"Effective and stable execution of a remote manipulation task in an uncertain environment requires that the task force and position trajectories of the slave robot be appropriately commanded. To achieve this goal, in teleimpedance control, a reference command which consists of the stiffness and position profiles of the master is computed and realized by the compliant slave robot in real-time. This highlights the need for a suitable and computationally efficient tracking of the human limb stiffness profile in real-time. In this direction, based on the observations in human neuromotor control which give evidence on the predominant use of the arm configuration in directional adjustments of the endpoint stiffness profile, and the role of muscular co-activations which contribute to a coordinated regulation of the task stiffness in all directions, we propose a novel and computationally efficient model of the arm endpoint stiffness behaviour. Real-time tracking of the human arm kinematics is achieved using an arm triangle monitored by three markers placed at the shoulder, elbow and wrist level. In addition, a co-contraction index is defined using muscular activities of a dominant antagonistic muscle pair. Calibration and identification of the model parameters are carried out experimentally, using perturbation-based arm endpoint stiffness measurements in different arm configurations and co-contraction levels of the chosen muscles. Results of this study suggest that the proposed model enables the master to naturally execute a remote task by modulating the direction of the major axes of the endpoint stiffness and its volume using arm configuration and the co-activation of the involved muscles, respectively."
737362,22736,23735,Efficient seabed coverage path planning for ASVs and AUVs,2012,"Coverage path planning is the problem of moving an effector (e.g. a robot, a sensor) over all points in a given region. In marine robotics, a number of applications require to cover a region on the seafloor while navigating above it at a constant depth. This is the case of Autonomous Surface Vehicles, that always navigate at the water surface level, but also of several Autonomous Underwater Vehicle tasks as well. Most existing coverage algorithms sweep the free space in the target region using lawnmower-like back-and-forth motions, and the inter-lap spacing between these back-and-forth laps is determined by the robot's sensor coverage range. However, while covering the seafloor surface by navigating above it at a constant depth, the sensor's field of view varies depending on the seafloor height. Therefore, to ensure full coverage one would need to use the inter-lap spacing determined by the shallowest point on the target surface, resulting in undesired coverage overlapping among the back-and-forth laps. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate a coverage path that completely covers a surface of interest on the seafloor by navigating in a constant-depth plane above it. The proposed method uses environment information to minimize the coverage overlapping by segmenting the target surface in regions of similar depth features and addressing them as individual coverage path planning problems. A cell decomposition coverage method is applied to each region. The surface gradient is used to determine the best sweep orientation in each cell, and the inter-lap spacing in the lawnmower-like paths used to cover each cell is maximized on a lap-by-lap basis, hence obtaining a shorter, more efficient coverage path. The proposal is validated in simulation experiments conducted with a real-world bathymetric dataset that show a significant increase on path efficiency in comparison with a standard boustrophedon coverage path."
2189758,22736,23735,Altruistic task allocation despite unbalanced relationships within Multi-Robot Communities,2009,"Typical Multi-Robot Systems consist of robots cooperating to maximize global fitness functions. However, in some scenarios, the set of interacting robots may not share common goals and thus the concept of a global fitness function becomes invalid. This work examines Multi-Robot Communities (MRC), in which individual robots have independent goals. Within the MRC context, we present a task allocation architecture that optimizes individual robot fitness functions over long time horizons using reciprocal altruism. Previous work has shown that reciprocating altruistic relationships can evolve between two willing robots, using market-based task auctions, while still protecting against selfish robots aiming to exploit altruism. As these relationships grow, robots are increasingly likely to perform tasks for one another without any reward or promise of payback. This work furthers this notion by considering cases where an imbalance exists in the altruistic relationship. The imbalance occurs when one robot can perform another robot's task, thereby exhibiting altruism, but the other robot cannot reciprocate since it is physically unable (e.g. lack of adequate sensors or actuators). A new altruistic controller to deal with such imbalances is presented. The controller permits a robot to build altruistic relationships with the community as a whole (one-to-many), instead of just with single robots (one-to-one). The controller is proven stable and guarantees altruistic relationships will grow, if robots are willing, while still minimizing the effects of selfish robots. Results indicate that the one-to-many controller performs comparable to the one-to-one on most problems, but excels in the case of an unbalanced altruistic relationship."
1092138,22736,23735,Control of Space Free-Flying Robots Using Regulated Sliding Mode Controller,2006,"In this paper, considering Space Free-Flyer Robots as highly nonlinear coupled systems, a chattering avoidance sliding mode controller is developed with confined computational burden for on-line implementations. A regulating routine is proposed to determine proper positive values for the coefficient of sliding condition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost for on-line applications, an explicit direct relationship between the SFFR's actuators (force/torque) demands and measurement of distances from the corresponding sliding surfaces is proposed. Then this model is optimally parameterized using Prediction Error Method (PEM). Also, to achieve an acceptable performance, the parameters are estimated recursively using Kalman Filter as a parameter estimator. To this end, first an explicit dynamics model of a 14-DOF SFFR is derived via SPACEMAPLE where Recursive PEM method is used for parameterization of the SFFR model. Then, based on the estimated dynamics, a multi input sliding mode control law is applied to the given SFFR to catch a moving target. To evaluate the new proposed algorithm in a more complicated condition, it is assumed that for controlling the base of SFFR only on-off actuators are available, which can just generate a constant positive or negative force/torque. The obtained results show that the proposed regulated sliding mode controller can significantly alleviate the chattering trend, and consequently energy consumption will be substantially decreased as well as reduced computational burden with reasonable running time duration for on-line implementations."
2984886,22736,23735,Intention recognition for gaze controlled robotic minimally invasive laser ablation,2016,"Eye tracking technology has shown promising results for allowing hands-free control of robotically-mounted cameras and tools. However existing systems present only limited capabilities in allowing the full range of camera motions in a safe, intuitive manner. This paper introduces a framework for the recognition of surgeon intention, allowing activation and control of the camera through natural gaze behaviour. The system is resistant to noise such as blinking, while allowing the surgeon to look away safely at any time. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel approach to control the translation of the camera along its optical axis using a combination of eye tracking and stereo reconstruction. Combining eye tracking and stereo reconstruction allows the system to determine which point in 3D space the user is fixating, enabling a translation of the camera to achieve the optimal viewing distance. In addition, the eye tracking information is used to perform automatic laser targeting for laser ablation. The desired target point of the laser, mounted on a separate robotic arm, is determined with the eye tracking thus removing the need to manually adjust the laser's target point before starting each new ablation. The calibration methodology used to obtain millimetre precision for the laser targeting without the aid of visual servoing is described. Finally, a user study validating the system is presented, showing clear improvement with median task times under half of those of a manually controlled robotic system."
2180005,22736,23735,A Cross-Platform Network-Ready Visual Servo Simulator,2006,"The field of visual servoing is now widely accepted as a modern, consolidated discipline for vision-based real-time robot control. Though experimental setups have become affordable, theoretical and practical issues arise, which advise the use of simulation systems prior to real execution. This paper presents an object-oriented, cross-platform, network-ready environment for visual servoing simulations. With flexibility and extensibility as the main design goals, tasks can be defined either for cameras attached to moving Cartesian frames, or serial link manipulators. In order to provide fast feedback to the user, it includes real-time 3D rendering of the simulated scene. Task parameters and visual features can be freely chosen, and new features can be easily added to the framework. Output data is logged to disk files, which can be analyzed by any popular mathematical package. The simulator is built upon an agent-based framework, which makes possible the distribution across multiple networked computers. Moreover, it can be securely downloaded from a web server and automatically installed in a computer, running either Windows, Linux or Mac OS X operating systems. This simulator is now a valuable tool in our research lab, and it has been extensively used by the students of a recent online course on visual servoing."
765171,22736,23735,Task allocation for event-aware spatiotemporal sampling of environmental variables,2005,"Monitoring of environmental phenomena with embedded networked sensing confronts the challenges of both unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena coupled with the demands for a high spatial sampling rate in three dimensions. For example, low distortion mapping of critical solar radiation properties in forest environments may require two-dimensional spatial sampling rates of greater than 10 samples/m/sup 2/ over transects exceeding 1000 m/sup 2/. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. A new approach, networked infomechanical system (NIMS), has been introduced to combine autonomous-articulated and static sensor nodes enabling sufficient spatiotemporal sampling density over large transects to meet a general set of environmental mapping demands. This paper describes our work on the critical parts of NIMS, the task allocation module. We present our methodologies and the two basic greedy task allocation policies - based on time of the task arrival (time policy) and distance from the robot to the task (distance policy). We present results from NIMS deployed in a forest reserve and from a lab testbed. The results show that both policies are adequate for the task of spatiotemporal sampling, but also complement each other. Finally, we suggest the future direction of research that would both help us better quantify the performance of our system and create more complex policies."
2988839,22736,23735,Balance and impedance optimization control for COmpliant huMANoid stepping,2016,"The work presented herein, attempts to address the problem of designing stepping recovery controllers for compliantly actuated humanoid robots. Based on the decomposition of the stepping procedure into three distinct phases, which are characterized by unique combinations of configurations and impedance levels, the contrivance of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimization process allows for the production of a corresponding number of controllers. The penalties associated with the proposed cost functions, which account for compliant dynamics and balance-related parameters alike, are selected in a systematic manner that facilitates the generation of the appropriate impedance levels required for each particular phase of the stepping motion. Subsequently, the superimposition of gravity compensation control, onto the original LQR controllers, renders them nonlinear and theoretically capable of tracking referential stepping trajectories. The associated referential motor positions are then generated by exploiting a formula relating the Centre-of-Pressure (CoP) to the compliant ankle dynamics, thereby satisfying the balancing constraints whilst also accounting for the system's inherent under-actuation. Thus, the technique's novelty stems from its explicit consideration of flexible joint dynamics and deflection torques, for the design of the desired impedance levels and joint stepping trajectories. The Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) powered COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN), has served as an avatar of the stepping recovery methodology that is expounded in the paper."
2997343,22736,23735,Performance comparison of Wave Variable Transformation and Time Domain Passivity Approaches for time-delayed teleoperation: Preliminary results,2016,"This paper presents initial results of a set of experiments to compare time-delayed teleoperation performance of selected architectures based on two popular passivity based methods, namely, Wave Variables Transformation (WVT) and Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA). Five different architectures widely used and available in literature are selected: 2-channel and 3-channel for both WV and TDPA, and 4-channel based on TDPA. An empirical approach for measuring transparency is proposed, which presents three main qualities: 1) Controller independency 2) Frequency dependency of performance and 3) Removal of the human operator out of the loop. In order to achieve this, the human operator is replaced by a linear actuator equipped with a force sensor. Deterministic interactions between the simulated operator and the rest of the system can thus be easily implemented and registered. Therefore, this approach allows to isolate pure effects of any control method and perform a proper analysis in terms of selected attributes for a desired metrics. In this article, these are chosen to be effective impedance and position tracking error, both in the frequency domain. In addition to the quantitative results, a qualitative analysis is presented which underlines practical implications of each architecture and control method. The comparison sample presented contains five different delays, varying from 0 to 200 milliseconds, five different environmental impedances and 5 bilateral control architectures along with an analysis of the results obtained."
2624523,22736,23735,Generation of dynamically feasible and collision free trajectory by applying six-order Bezier curve and local optimal reshaping,2015,"This paper considers the problem of generating dynamically feasible and collision free trajectory for unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) in cluttered environments. General random-based searching algorithms output piecewise linear paths, which cause big discrepancy when used as navigation reference for UAVs with high speed. Meanwhile, the disturbance may also occur to lead the UAVs into danger. In order to obtain agile autonomy without potential dangers, this paper introduces a three-step method to generate feasible reference. In the first step, a six-order Bezier curve, which uses Tuning Rotation to decrease the curvature, is introduced to smooth the output of the path planner. Then a forward simulation is implemented to find the potential dangerous regions. Finally, the path is reshaped by local optimal reshaping planner to eliminate residual dangers. The three steps form a circulation, the reshaped path sent to the first step again to check dynamic feasibility and safety. The method combining Six-order Bezier curve, Tuning Rotation, and local optimal reshaping is proposed by us for the first time, where the Tuning Rotation is able to meet various curvature requirements without violating the previous path, local optimal reshaping obtains both temporal and spatial reshaping with high time efficiency. The method addresses the system dynamics to achieve agile autonomy, which provides the geometry reference as well as the low level control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulations."
2623342,22736,23735,A robotic system for actively stiffening flexible manipulators,2015,"A system for actively changing the stiffness of a long, thin, flexible robotic manipulator has been designed for cardiologists to use in a range of diagnosis and treatment procedures. Low-stiffness manipulators, such as catheters, are ideal for steering through vasculature with low risk of tissue injury. However, such instruments are not well-suited for applying force to tissue. The proposed system solves this problem by using a series of bead-shaped vertebrae containing pull wires to actively change the stiffness of the catheter, similar to gooseneck surgical retractors. Individual wires steer the catheter to a desired location. All wires are then tensioned to create friction between each vertebra and prevent sliding, therefore resisting motion. While this design concept has been implemented manually in various settings for decades, fine robotic control of the friction and stiffness of the system relies on a thorough understanding of the friction properties between vertebral segments. We have developed an analytical model to understand the interactions between vertebrae and determine the relationships between system parameters and the overall stiffness of the catheter. Experiments validated the calculations from the model and the functionality of the system by applying known loads to the tip of the catheter and measuring the catheter displacement. The catheter stiffness was measured to range from 100 N/m to 800 N/m, which is sufficient for performing many surgical tasks on tissue. This system can be useful in minimally invasive procedures involving direct instrument contact with tissue by improving accuracy, safety, and work flow."
2145173,22736,23735,EMG pattern recognition and grasping force estimation: Improvement to the myocontrol of multi-DOF prosthetic hands,2009,"The multi-DOF prosthetic hand's myocontrol needs to recognize more hand gestures (or motions) based on myoelectric signals. This paper presents a classification method, which is based on the support vector machine (SVM), to classify 19 different hand gesture modes through electromyographic (EMG) signals acquired from six surface myoelectric electrodes. All hand gestures are based on a 3-DOF configuration, which makes the hand perform like three-fingered. The training performance is very high within each test session, but the cross-session validation is typically low. Acceptable cross-session performance can be achieved by training with more sessions or fewer gesture modes. A fast rhythm muscle contraction is suggested, which can make the training samples more resourceful and improve the prediction accuracy comparing with a relative slow muscle contraction method. For many precise grasp tasks, it is beneficial to the prosthetic hand's myocontrol if we can efficiently extract the grasp force directly from EMG signals. Through grasping a JR3 6 dimension force/torque sensor, the force signal applying to the sensor can be recorded synchronously with myoelectric signals. This paper uses three methods, local weighted projection regression (LWPR), artificial neural network (ANN) and SVM, to find the best regression relationship between these two kinds of signals. It reveals that the SVM method is better than ANN and LWPR, especially in the case of cross-session validation. Also, the performance of grasping force estimation based on specific hand gestures is superior to the performance of grasping with random fingers."
3008202,22736,23735,Nonholonomic closed-loop velocity control of a soft-tethered magnetic capsule endoscope,2016,"In this paper, we demonstrate velocity-level closed-loop control of a tethered magnetic capsule endoscope that is actuated via serial manipulator with a permanent magnet at its end-effector. Closed-loop control (2 degrees-of-freedom in position, and 2 in orientation) is made possible with the use of a real-time magnetic localization algorithm that utilizes the actuating magnetic field and thus does not require additional hardware. Velocity control is implemented to create smooth motion that is clinically necessary for colorectal cancer diagnostics. Our control algorithm generates a spline that passes through a set of input points that roughly defines the shape of the desired trajectory. The velocity controller acts in the tangential direction to the path, while a secondary position controller enforces a nonholonomic constraint on capsule motion. A soft nonholonomic constraint is naturally imposed by the lumen while we enforce a strict constraint for both more accurate estimation of tether disturbance and hypothesized intuitiveness for a clinician's teleoperation. An integrating disturbance force estimation control term is introduced to predict the disturbance of the tether. This paper presents the theoretical formulations and experimental validation of our methodology. Results show the system's ability to achieve a repeatable velocity step response with low steady-state error as well as ability of the tethered capsule to maneuver around a bend."
2565657,22736,23735,Real-time pattern generation among obstacles for biped robots,2015,"In this paper we present a step-planner embedded in a framework which enables a humanoid robot to navigate among obstacles, exploiting its overall capacities. The system allows the robot to react to changes of user input or changes in a dynamic environment in real-time while walking at reasonable speeds. The proposed method relies neither on external sensors nor on color coding or textured surfaces. The key idea is to use a fast collision model based on swept-sphere-volumes (SSVs) for real-time generation of collision-free footsteps and whole-body trajectories. Using a SSV-based 3D approximation in all control modules enables the robot to avoid collisions with itself and the environment. Obstacles are detected with an on-board RGB-D sensor while the robot navigates through an environment which is not known in advance. A step-planner reacts to high-level user commands like desired velocity and direction or changes in the environment within less than a step. Instead of investigating only the footholds an articulated 3D approximation of the lower leg and the foot is considered to find feasible and optimal footstep locations. Additionally, it provides an initial solution for the swing-foot movement. Finally, collision-free swing-foot trajectories are created in real-time in the feedback control layer using all the foot's degrees of freedom. We validated this approach in experiments with our robot Lola."
1281788,22736,23735,Fast voxel maps with counting bloom filters,2012,"In order to achieve good and timely volumetric mapping for mobile robots, we improve the speed and accuracy of multi-resolution voxel map building from 3D data. Mobile robot capabilities, such as SLAM and path planning, often involve algorithms that query a map many times and this lookup is often the bottleneck limiting the execution speed. As such, fast spatial proximity queries has been the topic of much active research. Various data structures have been researched including octrees, k-d trees, approximate nearest neighbours and even dense 3D arrays. We tackle this problem by extending previous work that stores the map as a hash table containing occupied voxels at multiple resolutions. We apply Bloom filters to the problem of spatial querying and voxel maps for the example application of SLAM. Their efficacy is demonstrated building 3D maps with both simulated and real 3D point cloud data. Looking up whether a voxel is occupied is three times faster than the hash table and within 10% of the speed of querying a dense 3D array, potentially the upper limit to query speed. Map generation was done with scan to map alignment on simulated depth images, for which the true pose is available. The calculated poses exhibited sub-voxel error of 0.02m and 0.3 degrees for a typical indoor scene with a map resolution of 0.04m."
2957771,22736,23735,Autonomous 6D-docking and manipulation with non-stationary-base using self-reconfigurable modular robots,2016,"Aggregation of self-reconfigurable robotic modules can potentially offer many advantages for robotic locomotion and manipulation. The resulting system could be more reliable and fault-tolerant and provide the necessary flexibility for new tasks and environments. However, self-aggregation of modules is a challenging task, especially when the alignment of the docking parties in a 3D environment involves both position and orientation (6D), since the bases of docking may be non-stationary (e.g., floating in space, underwater, or moving along the ground), and the end-effectors may have accumulated uncertainties due to many dynamically-established connections between modules. This paper presents a new framework for docking in such a context and describes a solution for sensor-guided self-reconfiguration and manipulation with non-fixed bases. The main contributions of the paper include a realistic experiment setting for 6D docking where a modular manipulator is floating or rotating in space with a reaction wheel and searches and docks with a target module using vision. The movement of the docking parties is a combination of floating and manipulation, and the precision of the docking is guided by a sensor located at the tip of the docking interface. The docking itself is planned and executed by a real-time algorithm with a theoretical convergence boundary. This new framework has been tested in a high-fidelity physics-based simulator, as well as by real robotic modules based on SuperBot. Experimental results have shown an average success rate of more than 86.7 percent in a variety of different 6D-docking scenarios."
2422864,22736,23735,Toward automatic classification of chemical sensor data from autonomous underwater vehicles,2011,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are commonly used to support oceanographic science by providing water-column mapping, seafloor bathymetric and photographic survey, and deep-sea exploration capabilities. In practice, the mapping activities carried out by AUVs consist of flying either pre-programmed tracklines (most propeller-driven AUVs), or else reporting data to human operators at regular intervals that permit retasking (typical for month-long underwater glider deployments). AUVs equipped with the ability to reason about scientific objectives in real time could significantly increase the value of individual deployments by enabling sampling efforts to be focused on targets or areas identified autonomously or semi-autonomously as scientifically interesting [1]. In this paper, we focus on AUV autonomy as it pertains to water-column sensing and argue that the classification of water-column sensor data represents an important enabling capability. We demonstrate practical, semi-supervised classification of water-column sensor data using a particular Bayesian, non-parametric clustering method, the Variational Dirichlet Process, combined with operator-supplied semantic labeling. The method is applied to the detection of a deep subsea hydrocarbon plume using data collected by the Woods Hole Oceanographic's Sentry AUV during an expedition to the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon blowout disaster."
2345516,22736,23735,A fluoroscopic-based navigation system for ACL reconstruction assisted by robot,2009,"Entry position of the graft is very important in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However the determination of entry position is very difficult to the surgeon. In this paper, a navigation and evaluation system assisted by the 6-DOFS robot is implemented for the simulation evaluation and planning insertion points based on quadrant method for the femur and Staublis method for the tibia on the lateral X-ray image of knee joint. Meanwhile, the implementation of the key technologies such as image correction, image registration, C-arm calibration, video tracking, bone surface reconstruction, image fusion, 6-DOFS robot, and virtual simulation are introduced. Finally, Experiments about the tunnel planning method and real time tracking of surgical apparatus are implemented on 8 bone of plastic models (Sawbone, Swiss) and 10 bones of the goat. In the experiment, the tibia rotates around the femur under the surgeon's implementation to evaluate the planning result with the virtual simulation and evaluation module. The positioning error is 1.59mm from analysis on 30 space targets. The virtual reconstruction ACL is satisfied with two important criteria of the best isometry and collision detection between graft and intercondylar surface of femur. The results are well accepted in operations. In order to satisfying with the request of exact operation in ACL reconstruction, we have developed 6-DOFS passive robot to assist the surgeons entry positioning and drilling of implant tunnels, implementing exact operation in knee joint."
742952,22736,23735,Nonlinear model predictive control of joint ankle by electrical stimulation for drop foot correction,2013,"In this paper we investigate the use of optimal control techniques to improve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for drop foot correction on hemiplegic patients. A model of the foot and the tibialis anterior muscle, the contraction of which is controlled by electrical stimulation has been established and is used in the optimal control problem. The novelty in this work is the use of the ankle accelerations and shank orientations (so-called external states) in the model, which have been measured on hemiplegic patients in a previous experiment using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The optimal control problem minimizes the square of muscle excitations which serves the overall goal of reducing energy consumption in the muscle. In a first step, an offline optimal control problem is solved for test purposes and shows the efficiency of the FES optimal control for drop foot correction. In a second step, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problem - or online optimal control problem, is solved in a simulated environment. While the ulitmate goal is to use NMPC on the real system, i.e. directly on the patient, this test in simulation was meant to show the feasibility of NMPC for online drop foot correction. In the optimization problem, a set of fixed constraints of foot orientation was applied. Then, an original adaptive constraint taking into account the current ankle height, was introduced and tested. Comparisons between results under fixed and adaptive constraints highlight the advantage of the adaptive constraints in terms of energy consumption, where its quadratic sum of controls, obtained by NMPC, was three times lower than with the fixed constraint. This feasibility study was a first step in application of NMPC on real hemiplegic patients for online FES-based drop foot correction. The adaptive constraints method presents a new and efficient approach in terms of muscular energy consumption minimization."
2259804,22736,23735,Perturbation theory to plan dynamic locomotion in very rough terrains,2011,"Although the problem of dynamic locomotion in very rough terrain is critical to the advancement of various areas in robotics and health devices, little progress has been made on generalizing gait behavior with arbitrary paths. Here, we report that perturbation theory, a set of approximation schemes that has roots in celestial mechanics and non-linear dynamical systems, can be adapted to predict the behavior of non-integrable state-space trajectories of a robot's center of mass, given its arbitrary contact state and center of mass (CoM) kinematic path. Given an arbitrary kinematic path of the CoM and known step locations, we use perturbation theory to determine phase curves of CoM behavior. We determine step transitions as the points of intersection between adjacent phase curves. To discover intersection points, we fit polynomials to the phase curves of neighboring steps and solve their differential roots. The resulting multi-step phase diagram is the locomotion plan suited to drive the behavior of a robot or device maneuvering in the rough terrain. We provide two main contributions to legged locomotion: (1) predicting CoM state-space behavior for arbitrary paths by means of perturbation theory, and (2) finding step transitions by locating common intersection points between neighboring phase curves. Because these points are continuous in phase they correspond to the desired contact switching policy. We validate our results on a human-size avatar navigating in a very rough environment and compare its behavior to a human subject maneuvering through the same terrain."
637121,22736,23735,"The design and control of the multi-modal locomotion origami robot, Tribot",2015,"Origami robots (Robogamis) use architecture to strategically activate different sets and sequence of actuators to achieve large variety of reconfigurable forms. Tribot is a unique mobile origami robot that can simultaneously choose between two modes of locomotion: jumping and crawling. When assembled, Tribot measures 64 × 34 × 20 mm 3 , weighs 4 g, crawls at 17% of its body length per gait cycle and jumps seven times its height repeatedly without needing to be reset. To optimize the practicality of the nominally 2D design, we made two different approaches to build the prototypes. For one of them, we used the “traditional”, monolithic, layer-by-layer robogami fabrication method and the second, we printed out most parts using a multi-material 3D printer. By showing the performance of two prototypes side-by-side, we show that with the 3D printer, we can minimize the number of functional layers and reduce the fabrication time. The embedded sensors allow Tribot's crawling gait pattern and jumping height to be modulated with a closed loop control. We compare the expected gait step size and displacement to that of the presented prototype while describing the design and control parameters to achieve the experimental results. We also illustrated the preliminary graphical design tool platform developed to optimize the next design iteration of Tribot."
2032181,22736,23735,The Endo[PA]R system for minimally invasive robotic surgery,2004,"Minimally invasive robotic surgery systems has entered daily practice in dedicated clinical centers. Especially heart surgery profits from this new technique, due to a higher accuracy compared to conventional endoscopic interventions. Nevertheless some drawbacks have restricted a broader acceptance of these devices. The most urgent issues are lack of haptic feedback and prolonged operation time. Our research project tackles both topics, on the one hand by adding high fidelity force-feedback, on the other hand by automating recurrent manipulation tasks. These features have been integrated into the Endo[PA]R (endoscopic partially-autonomous robot) system, an open evaluation platform for robotic surgery. The setup comprises two low-payload robots equipped with sensorized surgical instruments and a third robot carrying a stereo camera system. Trocar kinematics, enabling surgical manipulation through small incisions, has been implemented for all robotic arms. In order to ensure operation close to reality, a thorax and heart phantom for surgical training was used in the experiments. Stereo vision is provided via a head-mounted display and force-reflective input devices are employed for user interaction. The system was evaluated by surgeons and it was capable of performing autonomous knot-tying."
907247,22736,23735,Comparative experiments on task space control with redundancy resolution,2005,"Understanding the principles of motor coordination with redundant degrees of freedom still remains a challenging problem, particularly for new research in highly redundant robots like humanoids. Even after more than a decade of research, task space control with redundacy resolution still remains an incompletely understood theoretical topic, and also lacks a larger body of thorough experimental investigation on complex robotic systems. This paper presents our first steps towards the development of a working redundancy resolution algorithm which is robust against modeling errors and unforeseen disturbances arising from contact forces. To gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches to redundancy resolution, we focus on a comparative empirical evaluation. First, we review several redundancy resolution schemes at the velocity, acceleration and torque levels presented in the literature in a common notational framework and also introduce some new variants of these previous approaches. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm. Surprisingly, one of our simplest algorithms empirically demonstrates the best performance, despite, from a theoretical point, the algorithm does not share the same beauty as some of the other methods. Finally, we discuss practical properties of these control algorithms, particularly in light of inevitable modeling errors of the robot dynamics."
2214225,22736,23735,Sensor referenced guidance and control for robotic nanomanipulation,2007,"Atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used as a manipulation tool for a decade. The problem of lacking real time visual feedback still limits its efficiency and hinders its wide application. Although the model based visual feedback can partly solve this problem, due to the complexity of nano environment, it is difficult to use a model to accurately describe the object's behavior. The modeling error will give the operator a false feedback and lead to a failed manipulation. In this paper, a strategy for visual feedback error on-line detection and correction is proposed to solve this problem. As the real time force information is a key factor for this strategy, an adaptable end effector is employed to accurately measure the interaction force between the probe and the nano-objects, and the system error is also compensated to improve the accuracy of interaction force measurement. Based on the true real time force information, an extended Kalman filter is developed to online detect whether there is a false feedback. Once a false feedback is detected, an optimal searching pattern is generated to get the real manipulation result in a short time. With the assistance of this strategy, the false visual feedback can be realtime detected and corrected without interrupting manipulation. Complex manipulation task can be finished without being interrupted by a new image scan. Experiments of manipulating nano-particles are performed to verify the effectiveness of this strategy, which demonstrated the improved efficiency of the AFM based nano-assembly system."
1982772,22736,23735,Fast and adaptive auto-focusing algorithm for microscopic cell observation,2011,"In biological and medical sciences, optical microscopes are widely used. By using the microscope, we can observe cellular dynamics including intracellular ions and molecules tagged with fluorescent dyes at a high magnification. However, a freely motile cell easily escapes from a field of view and a focal plane of the typical microscope. Therefore, we propose a novel auto-focusing (AF) algorithm and develop an AF and tracking microscope. XYZ positions of a microscopic stage are visual feedback controlled to focus and track the cell automatically. A bright-field image is used to estimate a cellular position. XY centroids are used to estimate XY positions of the tracked cell. To estimate a Z position, we use a diffraction pattern around the cell membrane. This estimation method is so-called Depth from Diffraction (DFDi). However, this method is not robust for individual differences between cells because the diffraction pattern depends on each cellular shape, reflective index and transparency. Therefore, in this study, we propose a real-time correction of DFDi by using 2D Laplacian of a center region of the cell as a goodness of the focus. To evaluate the performance of our developed algorithm and microscope, we auto-focus and track a freely moving paramecium. In this experimental result, the paramecium is auto-focused and kept inside the scope of the microscope during 45s. The evaluated focal error is within 5[µm], while a length and a thickness of the paramecium are about 200[µm] and 50[µm], respectively."
1778885,22736,23735,Tightly-coupled navigation assistance in heterogeneous multi-robot teams,2004,"This paper presents the design and results of autonomous behaviors for tightly-coupled cooperation in heterogeneous robot teams, specifically for the task of navigation assistance. These cooperative behaviors enable capable, sensor rich (leader) robots to assist in the navigation of sensor-limited (simple) robots that have no onboard capabilities for obstacle avoidance or localization, and only minimal capabilities for kin recognition. The simple robots must be dispersed throughout a known, indoor environment to serve as a sensor network. However, because of their navigation limitations, they are unable to autonomously disperse themselves or move to planned sensor deployment positions independently. To address this challenge, we present cooperative behaviors for heterogeneous robots that enable the successful deployment of sensor-limited robots by assistance from more capable leader robots. These heterogeneous cooperative behaviors are quite complex, and involve the combination of several behavior components, including vision-based marker detection, autonomous teleoperation, color marker following in robot chains, laser-based localization, map-based path planning, and ad hoc mobile networking. We present the results of the implementation and extensive testing of these behaviors for deployment in a rigorous test environment. To our knowledge, this is the most complex heterogeneous robot team cooperative task ever attempted on physical robots. We consider it a significant success to have achieved such a high degree of system effectiveness, given the complexity of the overall heterogeneous system."
1991197,22736,23735,Contactless deflection sensor for soft robots,2011,"In the emerging field of soft robotics, there is an interest in developing new kinds of sensors whose characteristics do not affect the intrinsic compliance of soft robot components. Additionally, non-invasive shape and deflection sensors may provoke improved solutions to assist in the control of mechanical parts in these robots. Herein, we introduce a novel method for deflection sensing where an LED element and a photodiode are placed on to two substrates connected physically or virtually at a deflection point. The deflection angle between the two planes can be extracted from the LED light intensity detected at the photodiode due to the bell-shaped angular intensity profile of the emitted light. The main advantage of this system is that the components are not in physical contact with the deflection region as in the case of strain gauges and similar sensing methods. The sensor is characterized in a range of deflections of 105–180 degrees, showing a near 1 degree resolution. The experimental data are compared to simulations, modeled by ray tracing. The light intensity vs. deflection angle measurements in our setup display a maximum difference of 9% and an average difference of approximately 5% with respect to the model. Finally, a shape monitoring system has been developed using the proposed concept for a flexible PCB. The system is composed of 12 deflection sensors that operate at frame rate of 33 Hz. This device could be applied to monitor the body shape of a soft robot."
933373,22736,23735,Experimental investigation of surface identification ability of a low-profile fabric tactile sensor,2012,"Humans usually distinguish objects by sliding their fingertips on the surface to feel the texture via mechanoreceptor underneath the skin. We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90%."
2877578,22736,23735,Reverberant sound localization with a robot head based on direct-path relative transfer function,2016,"This paper addresses the problem of sound-source localization (SSL) with a robot head, which remains a challenge in real-world environments. In particular we are interested in locating speech sources, as they are of high interest for human-robot interaction. The microphone-pair response corresponding to the direct-path sound propagation is a function of the source direction. In practice, this response is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic transfer function (ATF) of the two microphones, and it is an important feature for SSL. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF from noisy and reverberant signals in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. First, the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation is adopted to accurately represent the impulse response of the microphone array, and the first coefficient of the CTF is mainly composed of the direct-path ATF. At each frequency, the frame-wise speech auto- and cross-power spectral density (PSD) are obtained by spectral subtraction. Then a set of linear equations is constructed by the speech auto- and cross-PSD of multiple frames, in which the DP-RTF is an unknown variable, and is estimated by solving the equations. Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequencies and used as a feature vector for SSL. Experiments with a robot, placed in various reverberant environments, show that the proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art methods."
2957188,22736,23735,A magnetic soft endoscopic capsule for non-surgical overweight and obese treatments,2016,"Obesity is defined as an unhealthy excess of body fat, which increases the risks of medical illness and premature mortality. There are multiple health risks linked to obesity such as heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancers, gallbladder disease and gallstones, osteoarthritis, gout, and breathing problems like sleep apnea, and asthma. Intragastric balloons (IGBs) have become an efficient and less invasive method for obesity treatment. However, the use of traditional IGBs requires complex insertion tools and flexible endoscopes to place and remove the balloon inside patient's stomach. This causes abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and gastric mucous damage. To overcome these limitations, we designed a novel magnetic soft capsule robot for obesity treatment with magnetically actuated inflatable IGB. The balloon is made from a thin, flexible, biocompatible material, and is inflated to a desired volume using biocompatible effervescent chemicals. Instead of using complex deflation mechanism, a biodegradable material is developed to automatically deflate the balloon after a predetermined period of treatment. In addition, multiple capsules can be simultaneously swallowed. As the source of actuation is provided via external magnetic fields, the magnetic soft capsule size can be significantly reduced with no limitations on the power consumption. A prototype of magnetic soft capsule is developed. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
3007945,22736,23735,Efficient HZD gait generation for three-dimensional underactuated humanoid running,2016,"Dynamic humanoid locomotion is a challenging control problem, and running is especially difficult to achieve, given the underactuation inherent to aerial domains. Previous work developed a gait-generating optimization framework for dynamic locomotion in the context of hybrid zero dynamics, producing stable 3D walking on the humanoid hardware platform DURUS. Here, we demonstrate that this optimization method also extends to stable 3D running. Gaits generated from the optimization, which utilizes the dynamics of all 23 degrees of freedom to maximize energy economy, results in stable running in a DURUS simulation model. Notably, the presented running is underactuated in all domains, due to DURUS' spring-legged design. Further, we generate 25 different running gaits, over a range of speeds (1.5–3.0 m/s), to demonstrate the reliability of solving the large-scale nonlinear program. We report statistical performance of the optimization in successfully generating stable running (average computation time: 323 seconds) in an effort to establish a benchmark for large-scale gait generation. We inspected this array of gaits across speeds, noting recognizable trends in optimized strategies from prior studies on lower-order models—e.g., both increased step frequency and step length with speed—along with the first reported cost-of-transport curve for a 3D humanoid running model. We consider this result an important step toward humanoid running on the DURUS hardware platform."
1383325,22736,23735,RGB-D Fusion: Real-time Robust Tracking and Dense Mapping with RGB-D Data Fusion,2014,"We present RGB-D Fusion, a framework which robustly tracks and reconstructs dense textured surfaces of scenes and objects by integrating both color and depth images streamed from a RGB-D sensor into a global colored volume in real-time. To handle failure of the ICP-based tracking approach, KinectFusion, due to the lack of sufficient geometric information, we propose a novel approach which registers the input RGB-D image with the colored volume by pho- tometric tracking and geometric alignment. We demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach compared with the ICP-based approach and show superior performance of our algorithm with real-world data. I. INTRODUCTION Real-time photo-realistic 3D reconstruction of real world scenes and objects plays an important role for a variety of applications such as robotics, augmented reality, human computer interaction, and entertainment. One of the main requirements in the robot interaction with the environment is the 3D reconstruction and representation of real world environments. With the invention of the low-cost Microsoft Kinect sensor as an representative of a consumer-grade range sensing device, the high-resolution range images aligned with pho- tometric information become relatively easily available. The Kinect sensor opens up new possibilities to build a low- cost 3D modeling system with well-studied range mapping technologies."
995632,22736,23735,Large View Visual Servoing of a Mobile Robot with a Pan-Tilt Camera,2006,"Vision being the most important human sensor and feedback system is considered to play a prominent role in the future of robotics. Robust techniques for visual robot navigation are essential in service robotics tasks. This contribution presents a novel approach to large view visual servoing of a mobile robot with a pan-tilt camera. A predictive camera control scheme guarantees that the image features remain in the cameras field of view. In a demonstration the robot is manually guided through the environment and reference images of landmarks are taken at distinct waypoints. During autonomous navigation the robot later follows the demonstrated path solely based on the visual feedback provided by the landmarks. The camera gaze is controlled independent of the robots egomotion which enables the robot to track landmark features across larger distances and orientations. Therefore, fewer visual landmarks are required to describe a smooth path through the environment. In order to control the robot motion independent of the gaze the observed features are transformed from the image plane into a virtual camera plane. The rotational, lateral and longitudinal motion are controlled separately by selecting appropriate image features that decouple the rotational and translational velocity component. This property is particular useful for traversing confined indoor spaces such as corridors, in which landmarks are located lateral to the direction of robot motion."
1869945,22736,23735,Mesofluidic actuation for articulated finger and hand prosthetics,2009,"The loss of fingers and hands severely limits career and lifestyle options for the amputee. Unfortunately, while there have been strides made in advancements of upper arm and leg prosthetics, the state of the art in prosthetic hands is lagging far behind. Options are generally limited to claw like devices that provide limited gripping capacity. The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate a path towards a low-cost prosthetic hand with multiple articulated fingers and a thumb that rivals the human hand in terms of weight, size, dexterity, range of motion, force carrying capacity and speed. We begin with a description of the functional requirements for a human hand. When comparing requirements with actuation technologies, the fluid power approach has the potential to realize a prosthetic hand that rivals a human hand in size, strength and dexterity. We introduce a new actuation technology, mesofluidics, that focuses on miniaturization of fluid power to the meso-scale (mm to cm). As a novel demonstration of the potential for this technology, we describe a proof-of-principle mesofluidic finger that has intrinsic actuation and control (actuators and control valves within the volume of the finger). This finger weighs 63 grams, is sized to the 50th percentile male finger, has a total of 25 mechanical parts and is capable of providing 10 kg (22 lbs) of pinch force."
1908481,22736,23735,Robot vision: model synthesis for 3D objects,1998,"This paper presents the automated model synthesis component of an integrated passive 3D vision system. The synthesized models can be used by the object recognition and pose determination components. The model synthesis obtains the 3D object model from images acquired by a CCD camera posed at various known positions. This paper presents developments and discusses automatic model synthesis. The tasks include robust 2D feature detection; 2D feature post-processing for eliminating noise and recovering missing features; 2D feature grouping of structurally related 2D features; stereo triangulation with a new form of epipolar line constraint; projective inversion of ellipses; synthesis for circular shape in 3D space from its projective views based on the ellipse pose hypothesis; and incremental model synthesis of model from multiple views based on the vertex triangulation. To demonstrate full automation, we use a single CCD camera mounted on the last link of a robot arm. The integrated robot system is able to move the CCD camera around the object and capture images at various vantage points and furnish the camera pose corresponding to each image acquired. The intelligent system then synthesizes the extracted features from each image to obtain a 3D model of the object. Such an approach, though more difficult than the direct use of range data through range sensors, is of great importance for space and industrial automation where cost and flexibility are of concern."
2231803,22736,23735,Asymptotic stable guidance control of PWS mobile manipulator and dynamical influence of slipping carrying object to stability,2003,"The research concerning mobile manipulator being composed of a mobile robot and a mounted manipulator has been growing a topic. Further, traveling operation that means the mounted manipulator operates during traveling can improve the efficiency, since it can prepare some tasks during traveling for desired tasks required to do at the destination place. The traveling operation is also important for active sensing by hand-eye camera equipped at the top link of the mounted manipulator, because the camera have to be directed temporally to the moving object in the camera image to obtain information for navigation. However, the traveling operation of the mobile manipulator involves some difficulties to control, such as dynamical interference and non-holonomic character. Therefore the trajectory-tracking errors of the mobile robot that means the base link of the mobile manipulator are integrated on the floor. This integration is caused by the non-holonomic constraint expressed by a differential equation of first order. As the result of it, the integrated error never converges to zero by a controller being used usually for fixed manipulator, since the controller is based on the holonomic character. Constructing a controller including a consideration of the non-holonomic constraint can solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a control method that guarantees zero convergence of guidance errors and the trajectory tracking errors of mounted manipulator, and the proof is given by Liapunov method. Simulations confirm the performances of the proposed controller, and the results show that the guidance errors and trajectory-tracking errors converge to zero. Furthermore the dynamical influences that slipping carrying objects give to the tracking controller are evaluated by the resulted trajectories on the floor."
2901422,22736,23735,Urban scene segmentation with laser-constrained CRFs,2016,"Robots typically possess sensors of different modalities, such as colour cameras, inertial measurement units, and 3D laser scanners. Often, solving a particular problem becomes easier when more than one modality is used. However, while there are undeniable benefits to combine sensors of different modalities the process tends to be complicated. Segmenting scenes observed by the robot into a discrete set of classes is a central requirement for autonomy as understanding the scene is the first step to reason about future situations. Scene segmentation is commonly performed using either image data or 3D point cloud data. In computer vision many successful methods for scene segmentation are based on conditional random fields (CRF) where the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution to the segmentation can be obtained by inference. In this paper we devise a new CRF inference method for scene segmentation that incorporates global constraints, enforcing the sets of nodes are assigned the same class label. To do this efficiently, the CRF is formulated as a relaxed quadratic program whose MAP solution is found using a gradient-based optimisation approach. The proposed method is evaluated on images and 3D point cloud data gathered in urban environments where image data provides the appearance features needed by the CRF, while the 3D point cloud data provides global spatial constraints over sets of nodes. Comparisons with belief propagation, conventional quadratic programming relaxation, and higher order potential CRF show the benefits of the proposed method."
714102,22736,23735,RHO humanoid robot bipedal locomotion and navigation using Lie groups and geometric algorithms,2005,"The humanoid bipedal locomotion requires computationally efficient solutions of the navigation and inverse kinematics problems. This paper presents analytic methods, using tools from computational geometry and techniques from the theory of Lie groups, to develop new geometric algorithms for the navigation path planning, locomotion movement, and kinematics modeling of humanoid robots. To solve the global navigation problem, we introduce the new fast marching method modified (FM3) algorithm, based on the fast marching methods (FMM) used to study interface motion, that gives a close-form solution for the humanoid collision-free whole body trajectory (WBT) calculation. For the bipedal locomotion, we build the new geometric algorithm one step to goal (OSG), to produce a general solution for the body and footstep planning which make the humanoid to move a single step towards a defined objective. We develop the new approach called sagittal kinematics division (SKD), for the humanoid modeling analysis, to allow us to solve the humanoid inverse kinematics problem using the mathematical techniques of Lie groups, like the product of exponentials (POE). The works are presented along with computed examples of the humanoid robot RHO at the University Carlos III of Madrid. We remark that this paper introduces only closed-form solutions, numerically stable and geometrically meaningful, suitable for real-time applications."
1619389,22736,23735,Construction and use of roadmaps that incorporate workspace modeling errors,2013,"Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRMs) have been shown to work well at solving high Degree of Freedom (DoF) motion planning problems. They work by constructing a roadmap that approximates the topology of collision-free configuration space. However, this requires an accurate model of the robot's workspace in order to test if a sampled configuration is in collision or not. In this paper, we present a method for roadmap construction that can be used in workspaces with uncertainties in the model. For example, these can be inaccuracies that are caused by sensor error when an environment model was constructed. The uncertainty is encoded into the roadmap directly through the incorporation of non-binary collision detection values, e.g., a probability of collision. We refer to this new roadmap as a Safety-PRM because it allows tunability between the expected safety of the robot and the distance along a path. We compare the computational cost of Safety-PRM against two planning methods for environments without modeling errors, basic PRM and Medial Axis PRM (MAPRM), known for low computational cost and maximizing clearance, respectively. We demonstrate that in most cases, Safety-PRM produces high quality paths maximized for clearance and safety with the least amount of computational cost. We show that these paths are tunable for both robot safety and clearance. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of Safety-PRM on an experimental system, a Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM). On the WAM, we demonstrate the mapping of expected collision to robot speeds to enable the robot to physically test the safety of the roadmap and use torque estimation to make roadmap modifications."
2296454,22736,23735,Using socially assistive robotics to augment motor task performance in individuals post-stroke,2011,"This paper presents an application of a socially assistive robotics (SAR) system to hands-off post-stroke rehabilitation. We validate the technical feasibility and efficacy of our system in guiding, motivating, and administering an upper extremity rehabilitation task. The robot, which consists of a humanoid torso on a mobile base, monitors user performance on a wire puzzle task through a wearable inertial measurement unit and signals from the puzzle. Smoothness of stroke-affected limb movement is used as the evaluation metric. Five adults of mild to moderate functional ability in the chronic phase of stroke recovery interacted with our SAR system over three separate days. The inertial data from the five participants were analyzed using frequency domain techniques. Subsequently, the amount of power in frequency bands corresponding to voluntary (0.1 to 2Hz) and involuntary motion/jerk (4 to 8Hz) was evaluated. We found that, in adults of mild severity (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores greater than 40), the motion becomes smoother (the amount of jerk is reduced) over 3 days of task practice. In adults of moderate motor severity (scores below 40), the motion became less smooth. This may indicate that the combination of our task and SAR system is better suited for individuals with higher functional ability, and needs augmentation in order to aid those of lower functional ability levels."
2565428,22736,23735,Accelerating synchronization of movement primitives: Dual-arm discrete-periodic motion of a humanoid robot,2015,"Human-demonstrated motion transferred to a robotic platform often needs to be adapted to the current state of the environment or to modified task requirements. Adaptation, i. e. learning of a modified behavior, needs to be fast to enable quick utilization of the robot either in industry or in future household-assistant tasks. In this paper we show how to accelerate trajectory adaptation based on learning of coupling terms in the framework of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). Our method applies ideas from feedback error learning to iterative learning control (ILC). By taking into account the actual physical constraints of the synchronous motion - through synchronization of both positions (or forces) and velocities - it is not only a more faithful representation of actual real-world processes, but it also accelerates the speed of convergence. To show the applicability of the approach in the framework of DMPs, we tested it on a formulation which encodes an initial discrete motion, followed by a periodic behavior, all in a single system. Modifications of the original discrete-periodic formulation now also allow for the use of DMP temporal scaling property. In the paper we also show how the DMP coupling can be implemented in joint space, whereas the measured forces and previous approaches always remained in the task space. We applied our approach to an example dual-arm synchronization task on Sarcos humanoid robot CB-i."
2948854,22736,23735,HEXOTRAC: A highly under-actuated hand exoskeleton for finger tracking and force feedback,2016,"Exoskeletons offer an intuitive method for actuating multiple DOF of the body; this makes them attractive for applications where generation and coupling of artificial forces to the limbs is needed. Force feedback hand exoskeletons have been continuously considered for whole hand haptic interaction in virtual reality simulators, in teleoperation setups and for rehabilitation. In hand exoskeletons finger tracking, actuation and transmission systems must be embedded in confined spaces, matching at the same time the profound dexterity of the hand transparently and without causing a burden. Most of the design approaches for such systems have remained largely experimental due to hardware limitations, impacting heavily on important functional and ergonomic factors. This paper presents the design of a novel 3-digit hand exoskeleton, which addresses the issues of finger tracking and force feedback. It proposes a new approach for the application of the feedback force with a single attachment at the fingertip through a 6DoF kinematic chain. This kinematic linkage allows for unconstrained reach of the fingers within their full workspace and facilitates a sensor system for high resolution 6DOF tracking of the fingertips. At the same time the highly under-actuated mechanism permits application of a bidirectional feedback force at the fingertips. The hand exoskeleton fits an large range of hand sizes and requires no mechanical alignment between the linkage and the fingers, whatsoever. Preliminary results show the efficacy of this system as a tracking and force feedback device for the hand."
949429,22736,23735,Uncertainty-driven survey path planning for bathymetric mapping,2013,"We present a novel survey path planning technique which minimizes the robot's position uncertainty along the planned path while taking into account area coverage performance. The proposed technique especially targets bathymetric mapping applications and respects application constraints such as the desire to survey in parallel tracks and to avoid turns in the target area to maximize sonar measurements quality. While accounting for uncertainty in the survey planning process can lead to more accurate data products, existing survey planning tools typically ignore it. Our method bridges this gap using the saliency on an a priori map to predict how the terrain will affect the robot's belief at every point on the target area. Based on this magnitude, we provide an algorithm that computes the order in which to trace parallel tracks to cover the target area minimizing the overall uncertainty along the path. A particle filter keeps track of the robot's position uncertainty during the planning process and, in order to find useful loop-closures for mapping, crossing tracks that visit salient locations are added when the uncertainty surpasses a user-provided threshold. We test our method on real-world datasets collected off the coasts of Spain, Greece and Australia. We evaluate the expected robot's position uncertainty along the planned paths and assess their associated mapping performance using a bathymetric mapping algorithm. Results show that our method offers benefits over a standard lawnmower-type path both in terms of position uncertainty and map quality."
2253291,22736,23735,Depthmap-based obstacle avoidance on rough terrain,2004,"It is an important and difficult task for a mobile robot to detect the maneuverable area and to avoid obstacles. Numerous methods using ultra sonic or infrared sensors have been successfully proposed and adapted to various robots. These robots, however, cannot move around in unleveled areas because their sensors are incapable of measuring in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. Some obstacle avoidance methods using 3D sensors were proposed. It is a problem to move the robot around smoothly and continuously, considering that these methods require numerous processing steps and time to determine the obstacles and the avoidance path. In this paper, a new obstacle avoidance method using a depthmap is proposed that applies 3D sensor technology to autonomous exterior robot systems. Employing this method the robot is able to recognize the obstacle continuously and thus can be used on rough terrain. All processes in the algorithm handle images without the environmental model. In recent years, a sensing device used for laser modules or CCD cameras that can sense 3D space in real-time have been developed. Using such a sensor in conjunction with the proposed method, the test unit and autonomous vehicle were built to evaluate the methodology in an outdoor environment These units were able to detect the obstacle, avoid it, and Iocomote autonomously on rough terrain. As a result, this method has the advantage of robustness on rough terrain, and an autonomous mobile robot with this test unit is capable of navigation on an unleveled road."
2997228,22736,23735,Learning Cooperative Primitives with physical Human-Robot Interaction for a HUman-powered Lower EXoskeleton,2016,"Human-powered lower exoskeletons have gained considerable interests from both academia and industry over the past few decades, and thus have seen increasing applications in areas of human locomotion assistance and strength augmentation. One of the most important aspects in those applications is to achieve robust control of lower exoskeletons, which, in the first place, requires the proactive modeling of human movement trajectories through physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). As a powerful representation tool for motion trajectories, Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) has been used extensively to model human movement trajectories. However, canonical DMPs only offers a general offline representation of human movement trajectory and neglects the real-time interaction term, therefore it cannot be directly applied to lower exoskeletons which need to model human motion trajectories online since different pilots have different trajectories and even one pilot might change his/her intended trajectory during walking. This paper presents a novel Coupled Cooperative Primitives (CCPs) scheme, which models the motion trajectories online. Besides maintaining canonical motion primitives, we also model the interaction term between the pilot and exoskeletons through impedance models and apply a reinforcement learning method based on Policy Improvement and Path Integrals (PI 2 ) to learn the parameters online. Experimental results on both a single Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) platform and a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system demonstrate the advantages of our proposed CCP scheme."
2183240,22736,23735,Using the Waseda Bioinstrumentation System WB-1R to analyze Surgeon’s performance during laparoscopy - towards the development of a global performance index -,2007,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has become very common in recent years, thanks to the many advantages it provides for patients. Since it is difficult for surgeons to learn and master this technique, several training methods and metrics have been proposed, both to improve the surgeon's abilities and also to assess his/her skills. This paper presents the use of the WB-1R (Waseda bioinstrumentation system no.1 refined), which was developed at Waseda University, Tokyo, to investigate and analyze a surgeon's movements and performance. Specifically, the system can measure the movements of the head, the arms, and the hands, as well as several physiological parameters. In this paper we present our experiment to evaluate a surgeon's ability to handle surgical instruments and his/her depth perception using a laparoscopic view. Our preliminary analysis of a subset of the acquired data (i.e. comfort of the subjects; the amount of time it took o complete each exercise; and respiration) clearly shows that the expert surgeon and the group of medical students perform very differently. Therefore, WB-1R (or, better, a newer version tailored specifically for use in the operating room) could provide important additional information to help assess the experience and performance of surgeons, thus leading to the development of a global performance index for surgeons during MIS. These analyses and modeling, moreover, are an important step towards the automatization and the robotic assistance of the surgical gesture."
737305,22736,23735,Ninja legs: Amphibious one degree of freedom robotic legs,2013,"In this paper we propose a design of a class of robotic legs (known as “Ninja legs”) that enable amphibious operation, both walking and swimming, for use on a class of hexapod robots. Amphibious legs equip the robot with a capability to explore diverse locations in the world encompassing both those that are on the ground as well as underwater. In this paper we work with a hexapod robot of the Aqua vehicle family (based on a body plan first developed by Buehler et al. [1]), which is an amphibious robot that employs legs for amphibious locomotion. Many different leg designs have been previously developed for Aqua-class vehicles, including both robust all-terrain legs for walking, and efficient flippers for swimming. But the walking legs have extremely poor thrust for swimming and the flippers are completely unsuitable for terrestrial operations. In this work we propose a single leg design with the advantages of both the walking legs and the swimming flippers. We design a cage-like circular enclosure for the flippers in order to protect the flippers during terrestrial operations. The enclosing structure also plays the role of the walking legs for terrestrial locomotion. The circular shape of the enclosure, as well, has the advantages of an offset wheel. We evaluate the performance of our design for terrestrial mobility by comparing the power efficiency and the physical speed of the robot equipped with the newly designed legs against that with the walking legs which are semi-circular in shape. The swimming performance is examined by measuring the thrust generated by newly designed legs and comparing the same with the thrust generated by the swimming flippers. In the field, we also verified that these legs are suitable for swimming through moderate surf, walking through the breakers on a beach (and thus through slurry), and onto wet and dry sand."
1128672,22736,23735,Adaptive internal impedance control for stable walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains,2012,"This paper investigates how a walker could maintain the variability of an arbitrary set of state variables within desired margins while walking on an uncertain soft terrain. The state variables are dynamically related to the visco-elastic impedance parameters of the body on a given set of uncertain soft terrains using internal memory primitives. A rimless wheel, a walker in its simplest form, is used to perform numerical simulations based on analytical dynamic models and hardware experiments to test a novel algorithm. The rimless wheel model is widely used by the legged locomotion research community to understand basic collision and energetics during passive dynamic walking. Very often, variability of punctuated force perturbations across collisions between the legs and the ground cause uncertain steady state dynamics of walking. This leads to the existence of a finite probability that certain state variables can reach unstable regions. Such phenomenon is known as metastability of walking. In this case, we actuate the rimless wheel with a constant torque leaving it to develop any speed profile for a given visco-elastic impedance distribution of the ground and its own vertical visco-elastic impedance that pushes the rimless wheel against the ground. Here we measure the robustness of the novel algorithm by its ability to shift the distribution of collision forces to a safer region in order to minimize the probability of reaching a given critical force threshold. Our analysis shows that the generalization of the variability of walking in different regions of the internal and external visco-elastic impedance spaces can simplify the computational challenges of robust walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains."
935803,22736,23735,Accurate thruster modeling with non-parallel ambient flow for underwater vehicles,2005,"To improve the maneuverability of underwater vehicles, accurate thrust model is required. However, its modeling is not only difficult but also inaccurate, because it has highly nonlinear dynamics and many parameters which cannot be modeled exactly. Generally, a propeller's steady-state axial thrust is proportional to the signed square of propeller shaft velocity under bollard pull condition. And, it is reported that the velocity of the ambient flow of the thruster affects the thrust force largely. From these facts, we can easily make a reasonable inference that the thrust force may also be affected by the thruster spouting angle with respect to the vehicle moving direction. However, the effect of this non-parallel ambient flow is not well understood in the previous works. Hence, in this paper, a new parameter, what we call incoming angle, is introduced and its effect on thrust force is shown. Incoming angle is defined as the angle between the direction of thrust and that of vehicle velocity. The effect of this angle can be dominant during an underwater vehicle changes its direction, or an omni-directional vehicle carries out its task. The effect cannot be compensated by including the only parallel component of vehicle velocity into previous models. In this paper, based on the three axial flow states classification model, the effect of the incoming angle of ambient flow is analyzed, and critical incoming angle (CIA) is also defined to describe the thrust force states according to incoming angle. In order to characterize the effect of non-parallel ambient flow, the proposed model is evaluated by comparing experimental data with numerical model simulation data, and it accurately covers overall flow conditions within /spl plusmn/2N force error."
1838247,22736,23735,Autonomous vision-based tethered-assisted rover docking,2013,"Many intriguing science discoveries on planetary surfaces, such as the seasonal flows on crater walls and skylight entrances to lava tubes, are at sites that are currently inaccessible to state-of-the-art rovers. The in situ exploration of such sites is likely to require a tethered platform both for mechanical support and for providing power and communication. Mother/daughter architectures have been investigated where a mother deploys a tethered daughter into extreme terrains. Deploying and retracting a tethered daughter requires undocking and re-docking of the daughter to the mother, with the latter being the challenging part. In this paper, we describe a vision-based tether-assisted algorithm for the autonomous re-docking of a daughter to its mother following an extreme terrain excursion. The algorithm uses fiducials mounted on the mother to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimating the pose of the mother relative to the daughter. The tether that is anchored by the mother helps the docking process and increases the system's tolerance to pose uncertainties by mechanically aligning the mating parts in the final docking phase. A preliminary version of the algorithm was developed and field-tested on the Axel rover in the JPL Mars Yard. The algorithm achieved an 80% success rate in 40 experiments in both firm and loose soils and starting from up to 6 m away at up to 40° radial angle and 20° relative heading. The algorithm does not rely on an initial estimate of the relative pose. The preliminary results are promising and help retire the risk associated with the autonomous docking process enabling consideration in future martian and lunar missions."
987866,22736,23735,A component-based architecture for flexible integration of robotic systems,2010,"While a robot control framework generally focuses on real-time performance and efficient data exchange between cooperating tasks or processes, an application such as robot-assisted surgery often demands information from, and integration with, a number of other devices. Thus, the software framework for the integrated system may have different requirements and priorities than a framework for real-time robot control. This paper reports on a component-based architecture that seamlessly bridges the gap between real-time robot control and a distributed, integrated system. The starting point is the cisst library, which provides a component-based framework for lock-free and efficient data exchange between multiple threads within a single process, which is suitable for real-time robot control. This paper describes the extension of the cisst library to support distributed systems, while keeping the same programming model as the single-process, multi-threaded scenario. Thus, application software does not need to know whether the component providing services is within the same process, in a different process, or on a different computer. In comparison, most standard middleware packages support components that fall within the last two categories (different processes on the same computer or different computers). This does not allow them to take advantage of the higher performance that can be achieved using standard lock-free data structures that do not rely on the operating system or on middleware services. Thus, the novelty of this approach is that the same component-based architecture and associated programming model extends from a multi-threaded scenario (which provides the best real-time performance) to a standard multi-process distributed system."
1590308,22736,23735,On robot dynamic model identification through sub-workspace evolved trajectories for optimal torque estimation,2013,"Model-based control are affected by the accuracy of dynamic calibration. For industrial robots, identification techniques predominantly involve rigid body models linearized on a set of minimal lumped parameters that are estimated along excitatory trajectories made by suitable/optimal path. Although the physical meaning of the estimated lumped models is often lost (e.g. negative inertia values), these methodologies get remarkably results when well-conditioned trajectories are applied. Nonetheless, such trajectories have usually to span the workspace at large, resulting in an averagely fitting model. In many technological tasks, instead, the region of dynamics applications is limited, and generation of trajectories in such workspace sub-region results in different specialized models that should increase the predictability of local behavior. Besides this consideration, the paper presents a genetic-based selection of trajectories in constrained sub-region. The methodology places under optimization paths generated by a commercial industrial robot interpolator, and the genes (i.e. the degrees-of-freedom) of the evolutionary algorithms corresponds to a finite set of few via-points and velocities, just like standard motion programming of industrial robots. Remarkably, experiments demonstrate that this algorithm design feature allows a good matching of foreseen current and the actual measured in different task conditions."
2257598,22736,23735,Application of robotic mechanisms to simulation of the international space station,2003,"In 2004, the European COLUMBUS Module is to be attached to the International Space Station. On the way to the successful planning, deployment and operation of the module, computer generated and animated models are being used to optimize performance. Under contract of the German Space Agency DLR, it has become IRF's task to provide a Projective Virtual Reality System to provide a virtual world built after the planned layout of the COLUMBUS module enabling astronauts and scientists to practice operational procedures and the handling of experiments. The possibility for distributed multiuser access to the virtual lab and the visualization of real-world experiment data comprise the key features of the system. Through the ability to share the virtual world, cooperative operations can be practiced easily and trainers and trainees can work together more effectively in the shared virtual environment. The ability to visualize real-world data will be used to introduce measured experimental data into the virtual world online in order to allow realistic interaction with the science reference model hardware: The user's actions in the virtual world are translated into corresponding changes of the inputs of the science reference model hardware; the measured data is then in turn fed back into the virtual world. In order to provide astronauts and scientists with an even more complete insight into various aspects of COLUMBUS and the ISS, the simulation of the COLUMBUS module is currently being extended to include the entire International Space Station. This paper describes the background and the developed features which allow the creation of a virtual world that provides users with the feel of being on board the ISS."
2152499,22736,23735,Bayesian plan recognition and shared control under uncertainty: assisting wheelchair drivers by tracking fine motion paths,2007,"The last years have witnessed a significant increase in the percentage of old and disabled people. Members of this population group very often require extensive help for performing daily tasks like moving around or grasping objects. Unfortunately, assistive technology is not always available to people needing it. For instance, steering a wheelchair can represent an extremely fatiguing or simply impossible task to many elderly or disabled users. Most of the existing assistance platforms try to help users without considering their specific needs. However, driving performance may vary considerably across users due to different pathologies or just due to temporary effects like fatigue. Therefore, we propose in this paper a user adapted shared control approach aimed at helping users in driving a power wheelchair. Adaption to the user is achieved by estimating the user's true intent out of potentially noisy steering signals before assisting him/her. The user's driving performance is explicitly modeled in order to recognize the user's intention or plan together with the uncertainty on it. Safe navigation is achieved by merging the potentially noisy input of the user with fine motion trajectories computed online by a 3D planner. Encouraging results on assisting a user who cannot steer to the left are reported on K.U.Leuven's intelligent wheelchair Sharioto."
963193,22736,23735,A novel time optimal path following controller with bounded velocities for mobile robots with independently steerable wheels,2013,"Mobile robots with independently steerable wheels possess many high maneuverability features of omnidirectional robots while benefiting from better performance and capability of moving on rough terrains. However, motion control of such robots is a challenging task due to presence of singular configurations and unboundedly large steering velocities in the neighborhood of those singularities. Many proposed approaches rely on numerical solutions that keep the robot out of bulky regions around the singular points and hence lose some of the robot maneuverability. Based on a class of traditional path followers we design a new globally stable path following controller that exploits the high maneuverability of the platform. This design allows us to derive a set of closed-form analytical functions that describe the robot base velocity as a function of the wheels driving and steering velocities while abide to the robot non-holonomic constraints. Those functions are then utilized to find the maximum instantaneous velocity of the body that keeps the wheels velocities under the pre-specified bounds no matter how much the robot gets close or far from its singular configurations. The control algorithms developed in this paper have been evaluated on iMoro, a four wheel independently steered mobile manipulator designed and developed at IHA/TUT. Experimental data is also shown that show efficacy of the method."
1655563,22736,23735,A planar parallel manipulator - dynamics revisited and controller design,2005,"In this paper, the dynamic modelling and control design of a planar parallel manipulator used as a pick-and-place machine, is addressed. First, in a departure from standard modelling techniques utilized for planar parallel mechanisms, it is demonstrated that since the translational axes of the manipulator are driven by DC motors through industry standard ball screws, the nonlinear dynamics and coupling effects of the nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator are greatly reduced by a very large effective gear ratio factor, in this case, 1.097 xlO6. The dynamics of the driving motors thus become the dominant dynamics in the system. Hence, the dynamics of the entire system can be approximated as a set of three identical linear dynamic equations, each of which represents the dynamics of one kinematic chain, with constraints representing the coupling of these axes. Then a robust closed-loop controller designed with a Convex Integrated Design (CID) method is determined, such that multiple closed-loop performance specifications, together with a robustness specification, are simultaneously satisfied. The robustness of the closed-loop controller thus guarantees that the controller, although determined based on a simplified linear model, performs as expected on the practical system, i.e., the manipulator, hence results in satisfactory closed-loop performance. Both simulation and experiments conducted demonstrate that the multiple simultaneous closed-loop performance specifications are satisfied thus validating the simplified modeling strategy and verifying the effectiveness of the control design approach."
932437,22736,23735,Terminal sliding-mode based force tracking control of piezoelectric actuators for variable physical damping system,2014,"The need for safe human-robot interaction in emerging robotic applications has recently driven the develop- ment of new range of actuation systems spanning from variable stiffness drives to variable damping or full variable impedance joints. Concerning the provision of variable physical damping in compliant actuators, the main objective is to improve the control of compliant joint. In a particular class of these variable physical damping actuators (VPDAs), the level of generated damping is realized by creating a friction force which is actively controlled by piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). Therefore, to effectively control the damping output, the accurate force control of the PEAs is required. However, difficulties to precisely control the generated piezoelectric force stem from its highly nonlinear behavior such as hysteresis and creep effect. This paper presents a novel practical force tracking controller for PEAs with unknown hysteresis behavior. The proposed control consists of two elements: terminal sliding-mode based desired dynamics injection and model-free compensation for nonlinear dynamics of PEAs, which allow fast convergence and extraordinary robustness to the closed-loop system. The stability of the overall system is proved in the sense of Lyapunov. On the real prototype of VPDA, the proposed control scheme is experimentally verified and analyzed by comparison to other controllers, demonstrating improved force tracking performance of PEAs in VPDA system."
2019215,22736,23735,Two dimensional dynamic stability for reconfigurable robots designed to traverse rough terrain,2008,"Robots must be designed with consideration for reconfiguring body pose during operation if they are to address more challenging environments. Researchers have mostly relied on static stability methods to monitor the possibility of rollover in stationary or slow moving vehicles. However, little research in dynamic stability is being conducted for robots capable of reconfiguring their pose to overcome obstacles encountered in challenging terrains. A multi-degree-of-freedom robot with the capability to vary its center of gravity is discussed in this paper. It is designed to improve mobility over rough terrain and is used in this paper as an example to address one aspect of dynamic stability. A complete understanding of the dynamic behaviour of a multiple degree of freedom robot in unstructured terrain is a difficult problem to solve. It is too complex to solve completely and therefore a reduced aspect of the problem is addressed. The robot will only have the ability to vary its center of gravity in the plane parallel to its direction of forward motion. In addition the robot will only move on flat terrain and encounter an immovable linear step feature. The result of the research is that once the center of gravity is specified by selection of robot body pose, and a maximum obstacle considered, platform stability can be ensured with a maximum allowable velocity. In other words, a maximum allowable velocity of the robot is governed by the position of the center of gravity relative to the wheel in contact with the linear step feature. If the robot is traveling below the predetermined maximum velocity then the robot is guaranteed to remain upright."
819637,22736,23735,Daytime water detection based on color variation,2010,"Robust water detection is a critical perception requirement for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous navigation. This is particularly true in wide open areas where water can collect in naturally occurring terrain depressions during periods of heavy precipitation and form large water bodies (such as ponds). At far range, reflections of the sky provide a strong cue for water. But at close range, the color coming out of a water body dominates sky reflections and the water cue from sky reflections is of marginal use. We model this behavior by using water body intensity data from multiple frames of RGB imagery to estimate the total reflection coefficient contribution from surface reflections and the combination of all other factors. We then describe an algorithm that uses one of the color cameras in a forward-looking, UGV-mounted stereo-vision perception system to detect water bodies in wide open areas. This detector exploits the knowledge that the change in saturation-to-brightness ratio across a water body from the leading to trailing edge is uniform and distinct from other terrain types. In test sequences approaching a pond under clear, overcast, and cloudy sky conditions, the true positive and false negative water detection rates were (95.76%, 96.71%, 98.77%) and (0.45%, 0.60%, 0.62%), respectively. This software has been integrated on an experimental unmanned vehicle and field tested at Ft. Indiantown Gap, PA, USA."
1780141,22736,23735,Remote microscale teleoperation through virtual reality and haptic feedback,2011,"This paper reports the remote handling of microscale objects, between two sites approximately 630 km distant. To manipulate objects less than 10 µm, specific equipments such as AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) cantilevers integrated into a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) are generally required. Enabling remote access to such a system would benefit any micro/nanoresearcher. However, vision feedback and sensor data of a micromanipulation system are generally limited, hence the implementation of a teleoperation scenario is not straightforward. Specific tools are proposed here for an intuitive manipulation in a wide range of applications. To ensure ease of manipulation, both a 3D virtual representation of the scene and haptic feedback are provided. Force sensor feedback is limited since only two measures are available. In order to extend this information, vision algorithms are developed to estimate the respective positions of the tool and objects, which are then used to calculate the haptic feedback. The stability of the overall scheme is very sensitive to time delays. This requirement is taken into account in vision algorithms and the communication module which transfers the data between the two remote sites. In addition, the proposed robotic control architecture is modular so that the platform can be used for a wide range of applications. First results are obtained on a teleoperation between Paris, France, and Oldenburg, Germany."
2209052,22736,23735,Finding Resonance: Adaptive Frequency Oscillators for Dynamic Legged Locomotion,2006,"There is much to gain from providing walking machines with passive dynamics, e.g. by including compliant elements in the structure. These elements can offer interesting properties such as self-stabilization, energy efficiency and simplified control. However, there is still no general design strategy for such robots and their controllers. In particular, the calibration of control parameters is often complicated because of the highly nonlinear behavior of the interactions between passive components and the environment. In this article, we propose an approach in which the calibration of a key parameter of a walking controller, namely its intrinsic frequency, is done automatically. The approach uses adaptive frequency oscillators to automatically tune the intrinsic frequency of the oscillators to the resonant frequency of a compliant quadruped robot. The tuning goes beyond simple synchronization and the learned frequency stays in the controller when the robot is put to halt. The controller is model free, robust and simple. Results are presented illustrating how the controller can robustly tune itself to the robot, as well as readapt when the mass of the robot is changed. We also provide an analysis of the convergence of the frequency adaptation for a linearized plant, and show how that analysis is useful for determining which type of sensory feedback must be used for stable convergence. This approach is expected to explain some aspects of developmental processes in biological and artificial adaptive systems that develop through the embodied system-environment interactions."
1475459,22736,23735,Hopping control for the musculoskeletal bipedal robot: BioBiped,2014,"Bipedal locomotion can be divided into primitive tasks, namely repulsive leg behavior (bouncing against gravity), leg swing (protraction and retraction) and body alignment (balancing against gravity). In the bipedal spring-mass model for walking and running, the repulsive leg function is described by a linear prismatic spring. This paper adopts two strategies for swinging and bouncing control from conceptual models for the human-inspired musculoskeletal BioBiped robot. The control approach consists of two layers, velocity based leg adjustment (VBLA) and virtual model control to represent a virtual springy leg between toe and hip. Additionally, the rest length and stiffness of the virtual springy leg are tuned based on events to compensate energy losses due to damping. In order to mimic human locomotion, the trunk is held upright by physical constraints. The controller is implemented on the validated detailed simulation model of BioBiped. In- place as well as forward hopping and switching between these two gaits are easily achieved by tuning the parameters for the leg adjustment, virtual leg stiffness and injected energy. Furthermore, it is shown that the achieved motion performance of in-place hopping agrees well with that of human subjects. I. INTRODUCTION Robots can help to demonstrate and prove concepts on human locomotion such as concepts based on springlike leg behavior. Starting from simple models, hopping is a simple"
2969730,22736,23735,Human-robot shared workspace collaboration via hindsight optimization,2016,"Our human-robot collaboration research aims to improve the fluency and efficiency of interactions between humans and robots when executing a set of tasks in a shared workspace. During human-robot collaboration, a robot and a user must often complete a disjoint set of tasks that use an overlapping set of objects, without using the same object simultaneously. A key challenge is deciding what task the robot should perform next in order to facilitate fluent and efficient collaboration. Most prior work does so by first predicting the human's intended goal, and then selecting actions given that goal. However, it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to infer the human's exact goal in real time, and this serial predict-then-act method is not adaptive to changes in human goals. In this paper, we present a system for inferring a probability distribution over human goals, and producing assistance actions given that distribution in real time. The aim is to minimize the disruption caused by the nature of human-robot shared workspace. We extend recent work utilizing Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for shared autonomy in order to provide assistance without knowing the exact goal. We evaluate our system in a study with 28 participants, and show that our POMDP model outperforms state of the art predict-then-act models by producing fewer human-robot collisions and less human idling time."
2984980,22736,23735,Map-optimized probabilistic traffic rule evaluation,2016,"Current traffic rule handling in autonomous driving relies on non-scalable methods such as explicitly hard-coding sets of logical statements to evaluate rules. This is sufficient for early prototypes but is not scalable for larger systems designed to work in arbitrary locations. Such methods can also become problematic when traversing different geographical entities with changing traffic rules. Additionally, they do not adequately convey the uncertainty of the traffic rule evaluation stemming from uncertainty in sensor measurements. We propose an exchangeable traffic rules module which takes a knowledge base of sentences in first-order logic as input. These sentences consist of a limited number of high-level queries which are independent of local jurisdiction (e.g. can I turn right?). The knowledge base is then compiled into a potentially large logic graph. However, only a relatively small subset of the knowledge base is relevant for specific road geometries (e.g. some of the rules applicable to an intersection is not relevant for a T-junction). Since detailed road maps are available for autonomous driving, this information can be used to resolve these subsets in the knowledge base which only require map knowledge. Therefore, map information can be used to convert a single, large logic graph into a set of smaller, map-optimized logic graphs pruned for specific road geometries. The optimized graphs are then converted into Bayesian networks to facilitate probabilistic inference. Experiments were conducted using a traffic and scenario simulation framework. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance when using map-optimized logic graphs over a traditional first-order logic knowledge base."
1563516,22736,23735,Learning hierarchical representation with sparsity for RGB-D object recognition,2012,"RGB-D sensor has gained its popularity in the study of object recognition for its low cost as well as its capability to provide synchronized RGB and depth images. Thus, researchers have proposed new methods to extract features from RGB-D data. On the other hand, learning-based feature representation is a promising approach for 2D image classification. By exploiting sparsity in 2D image signals, we can learn image representation instead of using hand-crafted local descriptors like SIFT or HoG. This framework inspired us to learn features from RGB-D data. Our work focuses on two goals. First, we propose a novel Hierarchical Sparse Shape Descriptor (HSSD) to form learning-based representation for 3D shapes. To achieve this, we analyze several 3D feature extraction techniques and propose a unified view of them. Then, we learn hierarchical shape representation with sparse coding, max pooling and local grouping. Second, we investigate whether RGB and depth information should be fused at lower level or higher level. Experimental results show that, first, our HSSD algorithm can learn shape dictionary and provide shape cues in addition to the 2D cues. Using the proposed HSSD algorithm achieves 84% accuracy on a household RGB-D object dataset and outperforms a widely used VFH shape feature by 13%. Second, fusing RGB-D information at lower level does not improve recognition performance."
702967,22736,23735,Preliminary experiments of a miniature robotic system for tooth ablation using ultra-short pulsed lasers,2013,"As a preliminary step to achieve a long-term goal of developing an automatic dental preparation system for clinical operations, we design and build a miniature robotic system which can manipulate a laser beam to move in three dimensional spaces to remove hard tissue from a target tooth. The dental preparation requires the robotic system to own high accuracy, high ablation speed and small size. A 2D galvanometer scanners module is integrated to meet the requirement of a high moving speed of the laser focus. A closed-loop system based on a miniature-sized voice-coil motor and a grating ruler are developed to realize the accurate control of the focus. The overall size of the developed prototype is 108mm×56mm×43mm, which is small enough to be used in close proximity to a patient's mouth. The prototype has been tested by using two different kinds of laser generators, i.e., a nanosecond laser and a picosecond laser. The experiment results show that the robotic system can provide high moving speed of 1000mm/s with good shape accuracy. From the results, we found that nanosecond laser beam can be controlled to ablate zirconia and aluminum, but not suitable to ablate tooth because of tissue carbonization. By selecting suitable parameters of the picosecond laser generator, a target tooth could be ablated to produce a cylinder shape without carbonization. Limitations of the prototype are identified according to the experiment results."
2361448,22736,23735,Wheelchair navigation assisted by Human-Machine shared-control and a P300-based Brain Computer Interface,2011,"This paper presents a new shared-control approach for assistive mobile robots, using Brain Computer Interface (BCI) as the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). A P300-based paradigm that allows the selection of brain-actuated commands to steer a Robotic Wheelchair (RW), is proposed. At least one specific motor skill, such as the control of arms, legs, head or voice, is required to operate a conventional HMI. Due to this reason, they are not suited for people suffering from severe motor disorders. BCI may open a new communication channel to these users, since it does not require any muscular activity. The number of decoded symbols per minute (SPM) in a BCI is still very low, which means that users can only provide sparse, and discrete commands. The RW must rely on the navigation system to validate user commands effectively. A two-layer shared-control approach is proposed. The first, a virtual-constraint layer, is responsible for enabling/disabling the user commands, based on certain context restrictions. The second layer is an user-intent matching responsible for determining the suitable steering command, that better fits the user command, taking the user competence on steering the wheelchair into account. Experimental results using Robchair, the RW platform developed at ISR-UC [1], [2] are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies."
2925865,22736,23735,Real-time predictive kinematic evaluation and optimization for biped robots,2016,"Collision-free walking in cluttered environments is still an open issue for humanoids. Most current approaches use heuristics with large safety margins to plan the robot's motion. That way, the chance of collisions can be greatly reduced but the robot movements are artificially limited. In this context, we extend our framework for motion generation and whole-body collision-avoidance by an on-line predictive kinematic parameter evaluation and optimization: we propose to evaluate the parameter set describing the walking pattern by integrating the full kinematic model of the robot. Initial parameter sets, which are kinematically infeasible due to kinematic limits or collisions, can be identified and adapted before the motion is executed. Starting with a feasible solution, the parameter set is optimized using a gradient method. Since the method is applied before each step, while the robot is executing the previous step, it is very reactive to changes in the environment or in the user input. The optimization method is not limited to a specific walking pattern representation, but it is applicable to different representations. We want to emphasize its suitability for real-time control. The optimization can be stopped if it exceeds a predetermined time budget. In that case, an executable but suboptimal result is used. The method is presented with simulation results obtained with our multi-body simulation. We have also validated the real-time performance in experiments with our humanoid Lola."
2585065,22736,23735,Automated selection of spatial object relations for modeling and recognizing indoor scenes with hierarchical Implicit Shape Models,2015,"We present an approach that uses combinatorial optimization to decide which spatial relations between objects are relevant to accurately describe an indoor scene, made up of objects. We extract scene models from object configurations that are acquired during demonstration of actions, characteristic for a certain scene. We model scenes as graphs with Implicit Shape Models (ISMs), a Generalized Hough Transform variant. ISMs are limited to represent scenes as star-shaped topologies of object relations, leading to false positives in recognizing scenes. To describe other relation topologies, we introduced a representation of trees of ISMs in prior work together with a method to learn such ISM trees from demonstrations. Limited to creating topologies, corresponding to spanning trees, that method omits certain relations so that false positives still occur. In this paper, we introduce a method to convert any relation topology, corresponding to a connected graph, into an ISM tree using a heuristic depth-first-search. It allows using complete graphs as scene models. Despite causing no false positives, complete graphs are intractable for scene recognition. To achieve efficiency, we contribute a method that searches for an optimal relation topology by traversing the space of connected scene graphs, for a given set of objects, using an optimization similar to hill climbing. Optimality is defined as minimizing computational costs during scene recognition, while producing a minimum of false positives. Experiments with up to 15 objects show that both are achievable by the presented method. Costs, growing exponentially with the number of objects, are transferred from online recognition to offline optimization."
793680,22736,23735,On the Observability and Observability Analysis of SLAM,2006,"Simultaneous localization and mapping problem for mobile robots has received considerable attention over the last decade. The widely used formulation of the SLAM problem has been the augmented state approach in an estimation theoretic framework. Although, many related issues of SLAM such as computational complexity, loop closing and data association have received much attention, the observability issue has largely remained ignored. System observability is an important aspect in any state estimation problem. Observability analysis provides for understanding of the fundamental limits of the solution obtainable, regardless of process and measurement noises. The standard world-centric SLAM formulation is a highly non-linear system. Thus the direct use of linear observability tools and criteria in the analysis of its observability yields incorrect and inconsistent results. In this paper an appropriate method of analysis of the observability of non-linear systems is applied to investigate the properties of the standard SLAM formulation. Contrary to popular belief, it is shown through theoretical analysis that the standard 2D planar world-centric SLAM formulation involving odometry inputs for robot speed and heading, and range/bearing measurements to features in the environment is unobservable. It is also shown that for the system to be observable, it requires at least two absolutely known feature point positions, thus questioning the very meaning implied by SLAM. The analytical results thus established are verified through simulations."
1758092,22736,23735,Modeling and experiments of high speed magnetic micromanipulation at the air/liquid interface,2014,"One of the greatest challenge in microrobotics is the development of miniaturized smart surfaces for a high speed conveying and positioning of micro-objects. This paper proposes a new approach where objects are situated at the air/liquid interface and are manipulated through magnetic fields. It demonstrates that a good repeatability and a high speed can be obtained. A physical modeling is presented to analyze the dynamic behavior of the micro-object. Experiments are performed to determine the physical parameters of the model and to attest the good repeatability of the motion for an object of size 100x90x25 m 3 . A good agreement between the physical model and the experimental measurement is demonstrated. Since the velocity of the micro-object can be 10 times higher at the air/liquid interface than in the liquid this approach represents a promising solution to design smart surfaces for a high throughput conveying of micro-objects. I. INTRODUCTION Complementary to smart surfaces proposed in the literature, this paper proposes a planar magnetic micromanipulation principle. The micro-object is placed at the interface between two fluids, and the actuation is ensured by magnetic forces. The object is in equilibrium on the interface under the action of the surface tension and its weight and it moves on the surface with minimum friction. This approach enables to avoid adhesion issues and provides a high velocity motion. A model of the system is proposed, and the physical parameters, namely the drag coefficient and the magnetization, are identified. The repeatability and velocity are discussed and the dynamic model derived in this article can be used for closed loop control in future works."

This system exploits the electromagnetic properties of UHF radio signals to present a mobile robot with both wide-angle dasiaperipheral visionpsila, sensing multiple tagged objects in the area in front of the robot, and focused, high-acuity dasiacentral visionpsila, sensing only tagged objects close to the end effector of the manipulator. These disparate tasks are performed using the same UHF RFID tag, coupled in two different electromagnetic modes. Wide-angle sensing is performed with an antenna designed for far-field electromagnetic wave propagation, while focused sensing is performed with a specially designed antenna mounted on the end effector that optimizes near-field magnetic coupling. We refer to this RFID system as dasiafoveatedpsila, by analogy with the anatomy of the human eye. We report a series of experiments on an untethered autonomous mobile manipulator in a 2.5D environment that demonstrate the features of this architecture using two novel behaviors, one in which data from the far-field antenna is used to determine if a specific tagged object is present in the robotpsilas working area and to navigate to that object, and a second using data from the near-field antenna to grasp a specified object from a collection of visually identical objects. The same UHF RFID tag is used to facilitate both the navigation and grasping tasks."

An important feature of a flexible future-oriented robot controller is the capability to incorporate information from different classes of sensors and to have standardized communication interfaces with other factory-automation components. To ease the robot systems' operation a graphical user-interface is provided. Furthermore, implicit programming and action planning methods allow robot programming on a much higher level of abstraction than today's procedural programming languages. For industrial applications, this implies easier and quicker adaptation of robot work cells to new tasks and a significant increase of the robots' flexibility to allow the feasibility of small quantity orders. This paper gives a basic description of the principle of the hierarchical coordinator, the basic system concept for the development of complex control systems at the IRF. This concept has been developed and employed for the design of intelligent, autonomous robot systems, which are described in detail.

1016641,22736,23735,Haptic rendering of interacting dynamic deformable objects simulated in real-time at different frequencies,2013,"The dynamic response of deformable bodies varies significantly in dependence on mechanical properties of the objects: while the dynamics of a stiff and light object (e. g. wire or needle) involves high-frequency phenomena such as vibrations, much lower frequencies are sufficient for capturing the dynamic response of an object composed of a soft tissue. Yet, when simulating mechanical interactions between soft and stiff deformable models, a single time-step in the time integration is usually employed to compute the dynamics of both objects. However, this can be a serious issue when the haptic rendering of complex scenes composed of various bodies is considered. In this paper, we present a novel method allowing for the haptic simulation of a scene composed of colliding objects modeled at different frequencies: typically, the dynamics of soft objects is calculated at a frequency of about 50Hz, while the dynamics of stiff object is simulated at 1 kHz, being directly connected to the computation of the haptic force feedback. The collision response is performed at both low and high frequencies employing data structures which describe the actual constraints and are shared between the high and low frequency loops. We show that during the simulation we show that the objects behave according to two mechanical principles: non-inter-penetration and action-reaction principles.

Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) is developing a Humanoid robot, which has two 9-DOF arms, two 4-DOF hands, a 3-DOF waist and a 2-DOF neck. An automatic path planner which takes advantage of redundancy is also developed, but it requires huge computational power and time. For tasks which are very complex, or interacting with environments, robot path can be generated very easily and accurately by human teaching, hence the automatic path planner is not required. Using sensors, human motion is analyzed and converted to robot joint angles. For tasks interacting with unknown environment, teleoperation with force feedback is more useful. A simple platform-type master arm is designed based on the kinematic analysis of human. For force reflection, the pneumatic actuators are used. This device is integrated with KIST Humanoid robot as well as graphic simulator, so that the master arm can be used for teaching the robot or as the virtual reality device integrated with the graphic simulator. Force reflecting master hand is also developed. These force reflecting master arm and hand are very light and compact so that a human can wear easily while he feels the same force as the robot does while giving position command to the slave robot. In addition to master arm/hand, visual information is feedback to human through HMD for higher interaction. Therefore, a new way of integration of human and the robot is developed."
2615365,22736,23735,Design of CASIA-ARM: A novel rehabilitation robot for upper limbs,2015,"The population of disabled stroke survivors is increasing sharply over the world, and robot-assisted training has been proved to be effective to help motor relearning and alleviate the shortage of physical therapists. This paper presents the design details of a novel upper limb rehabilitation robot named CASIA-ARM, which can assist poststroke patients to perform shoulder and elbow rehabilitation training in the horizontal plane, and provide both force and visual feedback to the patient: 1) A five-bar closed-chain structure is designed to realize a stiff and low-inertial mechanism. Workspace and singularity analysis is given, which guarantees that the workspace is large enough for upper limb moving and no singularity in the workspace. 2) Cable transmission, motor current controller and impedance control method guarantee the transparent and compliant interaction between the human and the robot. 3) Implementation examples of passive training based on position control and active training based on impedance control are presented in detail. 4) In order to evaluate the robot's applicability and performance, examples of trajectory tracking and active reaching tasks are used in this study, and the preliminary test results are also given (tracking error: 0.86±0:42 mm, force control error: 1.41±0.79 N in the X direction, and 1.22±0.91 N in the Y direction)."
1262722,22736,23735,A general tactile approach for grasping unknown objects with a humanoid robot,2013,"In this paper, we present a tactile approach to grasp large and unknown objects, which can not be easily manipulated with a single end-effector or two-handed grasps, with the whole upper body of a humanoid robot. Instead of conventional joint level force sensing, we equip the robot with various patches of HEX-o-SKIN - a self-organizing, multi-modal cellular artificial skin. Low-level controllers, one allocated to each sensor cell, utilize a self-explored inverted jacobian-like sensory-motor map to directly transfer tactile stimulation into reactive arm motions, altering basic grasping trajectories to the need of the current object. A high-level state machine guides those low-level controllers during the different states of the grasping action. Desired contact points, and key poses for the trajectory generation, are taught through forceless tactile stimulation. First experiments on a position controlled robot, an HRP-2 humanoid, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our paper contributes to the first realization of a self-organizing tactile sensor-behavior mapping on a full-sized humanoid robot, which enables: 1) a new general approach for grasping unknown objects with the whole-body; and 2) a novel way of teaching behaviors using pre-contact tactile sensing."
2221851,22736,23735,The sigma.7 haptic interface for MiroSurge: A new bi-manual surgical console,2011,"This paper presents the design and control of the sigma.7 haptic device and the new surgical console of the MiroSurge robotic system. The console and the haptic devices are designed with respect to requirements in minimally invasive robotic surgery. Dedicated left and right handed devices are integrated in an operator console in an ergonomic configuration. The height of the whole console is adjustable, allowing the surgeon seated and standed operation. Each of the devices is fully actuated in seven degrees of freedom (DoF). A parallel mechanism with 3 DoF actuates the translational motion and an attached wrist with 3 intersecting axis drives the rotations of the grasping unit. This advantageous design leads to inherently decoupled kinematics and dynamics. Cartesian forces are 20 N within the translational workspace, which is a sphere of about 120 mm diameter for each device. The rotational wrist of the device covers the whole workspace of the human hand and provides maximum torques of about 0.4 Nm. The grasping unit can display forces up to 8 N. An integrated force/torque sensor is used to increase the transparency of the devices by reducing inertia and friction. It is theoretically shown that the non-linear closed loop system behaves like a passive system and experimental results validate the approach. The sigma.7 haptic devices are designed by Force Dimension in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR). DLR designed the surgical console and integrated the haptic devices in the MiroSurge system."
1470556,22736,23735,Contactless deflection sensing of concave and convex shapes assisted by soft mirrors,2012,"Typical deflection sensors like strain gauges or devices based on optical fibers require physical contact with the deflected substrate during the measurement process. Such contact, however, impacts on the softness of the substrate and may falsify the measurements. In order to overcome this drawback, a novel method of contactless deflection sensing was proposed in a recent work. It was verified that the deflection angle between two planes can be extracted using only a photosensor and a light source bearing a bell-shape angular emission profile. Yet, the range of operation was limited to concave shapes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative configuration of this light-based deflection sensing method to extend its functionality to convex surfaces. Here, a spheroidal mirror bearing a customized profile is introduced above the light source. This mirror redirects part of the emitted light towards the photosensor occluded by the bending surface during convex deflections.We make use of a ray tracing simulation method to design the mirror profiles, which are accurately reproduced in the manufactured prototypes by tuning the fabrication variables of the manufacturing process. Using a shape-sensing prototype, it is verified that the use of the mirror extends the range of detectable deflections by 55° to convex bendings, yielding a deviation of only 8.3% from simulated results. Our deflection sensing solution is a promising method to be used as a shape sensor in numerous applications, such as soft robotics platforms or prosthetic devices."
1251520,22736,23735,Wearable echography robot for trauma patient,2010,"The purpose of this report is to propose a diagnosis and treatment scenario by assistance of bystander and echography robot for trauma patient. Quick treatment is important for patients who have shock by internal bleeding. Therefore, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST), which is a simple and quick diagnostic method, was developed as a first lifesaving step in a hospital. However, a shock patient has little time, and transportation to a hospital may take too long. Therefore, we aim at development of a system which enables FAST at injury scene by assistance of bystander. To develop the system, life-saving flow and a FAST device are significant issues. First, we constructed a diagnosis and treatment scenario. Then, we developed a tele-echography robot system which has 4-DOF that a bystander could attach. This robot is attached to each roughly FAST areas of patient body by a bystander and remotely fine-tuned position by a doctor in a hospital. In this way, a bystander may not do an exact positioning. In addition, the robot has a mechanism to generate contact force between echo probe and patient body surface by two springs. This mechanism not only fit in patient body motion but also reducing the number of controlled axis. To confirm the medical applications of the scenario and the robot, we performed experiments with some examinees and doctors. We confirmed effectiveness of the mechanism and that a bystander could attach the robot to each roughly FAST areas of patient body. We also confirmed that a doctor could do FAST with the robot by remote-controlled on the roughly FAST areas in approximately three minutes. These results show that the robot would enable FAST by assistance of bystander, and the scenario would make FAST faster than the time required transporting the patient to the hospital."
1252839,22736,23735,"Forward kinematics of redundantly actuated, tendon-based robots",2010,"The number of ropes for a fully constrained, tendon-based robot has to be larger than the actuated degrees of freedom since ropes only impose unidirectional constraints. This actuation redundancy implicates that more position information is available than would be required for the the determination of the end-effector pose. This leads to an optimization problem for the forward kinematics of the robot which has to be solved in real-time. Furthermore, the kinematics of tendon-based robots are often kept simple in existing systems by guiding the ropes through holes into the workspace. This facilitates the description of the rope vectors. However, this solution is not applicable for high-load applications, as friction would cause excessive non-linearities and wear. To solve the forward kinematics of tenon-based robots, we introduce a physics-based interpretation of the mentioned optimization problem. The robotic system is described as a damped oscillator whose resting position is equal to the optimal solution. As a major advantage over the known algorithms, this physics-based approach is quantifiable in terms of accuracy of the solution and number of iterations. Furthermore, the design and mathematical description of a deflection unit's geometry is presented. This deflection unit guides the rope smoothly into the workspace and its relevant influence on the kinematic equations can be compensated. The physics-based approach is experimentally evaluated on a tendon-based haptic interface, the r3-system, and it is compared to the solutions using only the minimum set of sensor information."
626180,22736,23735,Specifications of a small electric vehicle: modular and distributed approach,1997,"We describe a small electric vehicle equipped with automation that allows autonomous motion. A fleet of such vehicles could be one element of a novel urban transportation system for door-to-door displacement in closed areas (city centers but also tourist resorts, campuses, ...) if they are used in self-service and car-sharing mode. The specifications in the matter of performances or energy storage agree with this application within this kind of evolution space (several short trips at low speed). A stylish look and an original electro-mechanical structure with four steering and driving wheels were adopted. As the vehicle is open to different users not having necessarily a driving-license, the vehicle must be friendly, easy to handle and secure not only for the driver but also for the pedestrians walking in the same area (computer aided driving). The driver must be free of parking or batteries re-charging problems. The progress of electronics and robotics allow us to envisage that these maneuvers could run automatically without human intervention. We have designed a modular and distributed hardware architecture with intelligent components (actuators and sensors) linked together by a field bus. Several solutions for the implementation of our software control architecture are examined."
1372036,22736,23735,Orienting deformable polygonal parts without sensors,2012,"Sensorless part orienting has proven useful in manufacturing and automation, while the manipulation of deformable objects is an area of growing interest. Existing sensorless orienting techniques may produce forces which have the potential to damage deformable parts. We present an algorithm that, when provided a geometric description of the part and a deformation model, generates a plan to orient the part up to symmetry from any initial orientation. The solution exploits deformation of the object under certain configurations to help resolve ambiguity. The approach has several attractive features: (1) the resulting plan is a short sequence of such actions guaranteed to succeed for all initial configurations; (2) the algorithm operates even with a very simple model of deformation, but is extensible when specialized knowledge is available; (3) failure to find a feasible solution has precise semantics (e.g., inadequate manipulator precision). We validate the algorithm experimentally with a pair of low-precision robot manipulators, orienting 6 parts made of 4 types of materials, with the correct orientation being reached on 80% of the 192 trials. Careful analysis of the failures emphasizes the importance of low-friction conditions, that increased manipulator precision would be beneficial but is not necessary, and a simple deformation model can suffice. In addition to illustrating the feasibility of sensorless manipulation of deformable parts, we note that the algorithm has applications to manipulation of non-deformable parts without the pressure switch sensor employed in existing sensorless orienting strategies."
2343839,22736,23735,Range From Focus Pixel-by -Pixel,1992,"We describe a nd demonstrate an ambient lllumlnation method for range Imaging In parallel with and using the same sensor that is used for Intensity Imaging. Our method automates the well known range-from-focus method. It makes use of our reaiizatlon that range can be calculated directly from a focus error signal: It is not necessary to actually focus the Image, only to measure the focus; error. We show theoretically and demonstrate experlmentaIly that the focus error distance can b e measured by time domain fourler analysls of the signal from a sensor that Is mlcroscoplcally oscillated (dithered) longitudinally in the space domain. In an approximation regime that our experiments show to be physically realistic, the ratio of the first two significant fourier amplitudes is proportional to the ratio of the focus error to the dither amplitude. Since the illuminatlon, the reflectance, and most technical noise sources affect all fourler amplitudes in an equal multiplicative fashion, the fourler amplitude ratio is a robust measure of the focus error to dither amplitude ratio. The constants needed to calculate absolute range images are the focal length of the lens, the sensor's mean position, and the dither amlpiitude. Experiments using a 50 mm W1.5 camera lens, a pinhole object, and a single detector dithered by an audio speaker demonstrate real-time range resolution of approxlmately 0.5 mun at a range of 350mm. Modelling lndlcatrs that the method, implemented with a sensor array, Is also applicable to extended objects. Plans for extending the experiments to real scenes are discussed."
1519477,22736,23735,Ball Catching by a Puma Arm: a Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Approach,2006,"We present an attractor based dynamics that autonomously generates temporally discrete movements and movement sequences stably adapted to changing online sensory information. Autonomous differential equations are used to formulate a dynamical layer with either stable fixed points or a stable limit cycle. A neural competitive dynamics switches between these two regimes according to sensorial context and logical conditions. The corresponding movement states are then converted by simple coordinate transformations into spatial positions of a robot arm. Movement initiation and termination is entirely sensor driven. In this article, the dynamic architecture was changed in order to cope with unreliable sensor information by including this information in the vector field. We apply this architecture to generate timed trajectories for a Puma arm which must catch a moving ball before it falls over a table, and return to a reference position thereafter. Sensory information is provided by a camera mounted on the ceiling over the robot. We demonstrate that the implemented decision-mechanism is robust to noisy sensorial information. Further, a flexible behavior is achieved. Flexibility means that if the sensorial context changes such that the previously generated sequence is no longer adequate, a new sequence of behaviors, depending on the point at which the changed occurred and adequate to the current situation emerges."
2174125,22736,23735,A model for precise alignment: nanometer positioning robotic stage (NPRS),2003,"There is a great deal of research evolved around systems to deliver precise alignment in the range of nanometer and arc the second for applications, such as positioning of samples used in surface analysis, or the alignment of chip sized components for assembly etc. These technologies feature the use of small-scale motors that rotate a relevant axis to provide a precise motion to a working stage. The problem with these technologies is there small output and the dependence on moving parts, which require maintenance. The aim of this paper is to present a model which is in the initial development phase, a low cost nanometer positioning robotic stage (NPRS) for the referenced applications. The NPRS comprises of two major units, one to provide lateral motion, which consists of a series of arrays of micro robots in the form of piezoelectric wires. The micro robots have the capability to displace laterally in the surface plane (X-Y) due to the supplied voltage (piezoelectric effect). The second unit is a novel micro actuator, which provides rotation to the micro robots. The difference between the proposed NRPS and current technologies, beside its low cost, is the utilization of hair-sized wires made of smart materials as micro robots, and the utilisation of the internal forces inside smart materials to generate the necessary rotation, the expected resolution is in the range of arc the second."
2591015,22736,23735,"Introducing MantisBot: Hexapod robot controlled by a high-fidelity, real-time neural simulation",2015,"We present MantisBot, a 28 degree of freedom robot controlled by a high-fidelity neural simulation. It is modeled after the mantis, with many degrees of freedom, because we intend to study directed behaviors and leg multi-functionality, such as prey tracking and striking. As a first step, we present a distributed reflexive posture controller. MantisBot maintains posture through a series of reflexes observed in insects, specifically: strain measurements from a leg produce proportional torque commands (reflex A); large or rapidly decreasing leg strains produce a rapid, single “restep” (reflex B); a leg can only restep if its neighboring legs are all under strain (reflex C); and a leg will search for the ground if it does not reach it as expected (reflex D). All of these reflexes contribute to a hardware platform's posture, and are implemented in a highly distributed fashion. The two most distal joints in each leg each has its own central pattern generator (CPG, 12 total), upon which all of these behaviors depend. To achieve the desired dynamics, we implement a control network of conductance-based neurons with persistent sodium channels arranged in a network like the animal may possess in its thoracic ganglia. The result is a robot capable of actively maintaining posture without a centralized planner or body model. In addition, the network implementation is fast, calculating network dynamics 150 times faster than real time."
1121275,22736,23735,Floor segmentation of omnidirectional images for mobile robot visual navigation,2010,"This paper describes a novel approach for purely vision based mobile robot navigation. The visual obstacle avoidance and corridor following behavior rely on the segmentation of the traversable floor region in the omnidirectional robocentric view. The image processing employs a supervised approach in which the segmentation optimal with respect to the appearance of the local environment is determined by cross validation over 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device (PMD) camera. The range data in the front view provides the seeds and validation data to supervise the appearance based segmentation in the omniview. Segmentation relies on histogram backprojection which maintains separate appearance models for floor, obstacles and background. A naive Bayes classifier predicts the occupancy of the robots local environment by fusing the evidence provided by different segmentations and models. The classification error is analyzed on ground truth data generated by a PMD camera and manually segmented scenes. The scheme is highly robust with respect to ambiguous and misleading visual appearances of obstacles and floor, thus enabling the robot to navigate safely in unstructured environments of diverse appearance, texture and illumination. The proposed vision algorithm and the navigation behavior demonstrate a robust performance in extensive robotic experiments across several hours of autonomous operation."
1720774,22736,23735,"An autonomous, underactuated exoskeleton for load-carrying augmentation",2006,"Metabolic studies have shown that there is a metabolic cost associated with carrying load (T. M. Griffen, et al., 2003). In previous work, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton has been described that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload (C. J. Walsh, et al., 2006). A state-machine control strategy is written based on joint angle and ground-exoskeleton force sensing to control the joint actuation at this exoskeleton hip and knee. The joint components of the exoskeleton in the sagittal plane consist of a force-controllable actuator at the hip, a variable-damper mechanism at the knee and a passive spring at the ankle. The control is motivated by examining human walking data. Positive, non-conservative power is added at the hip during the walking cycle to help propel the mass of the human and payload forward. At the knee, the damper mechanism is turned on at heel strike as the exoskeleton leg is loaded and turned off during terminal stance to allow knee flexion. The passive spring at the ankle engages in controlled dorsiflexion to store energy that is later released to assist in powered plantarflexion. Preliminary studies show that the state machines for the hip and knee work robustly and that the onset of walking can be detected in less than one gait cycle. Further, it is found that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle"
1918949,22736,23735,A new approach based-on advanced adaptive digital PLL for improving the resolution and accuracy of magnetic encoders,2008,"Position sensors using magnetic effects, such as magnetic encoders (MEs), are increasingly used in many industrial applications. These include motor control, electro-mechanical braking systems, and precision measurement systems. The magnetic encoders generally provide a pair of sinusoidal signals dephasing 90deg to each other. Unfortunately, the signals obtained are not ideal, in that they always exist with the DC offsets, different amplitudes, phase-shifts and waveform distortions. These are further compromised by noise and changes in operating conditions. This paper proposes an approach for real-time correcting and tracking ME signals based on the Advanced Adaptive Digital Phase-Locked Loop (AADPLL) technique. AADPLL provides a robust filtering characteristic as well as a wideband of input frequency. It can effectively filter noise and improve the accuracy of ME signals. AADPLL also takes advantage of tracking high-speed input signals without time-lag, unlike traditional filters. A quadrature pulse interpolator is introduced to obtain high resolution. This interpolator uses look-up tables (LUTs) to store pulse-out values in one period of MEs signals. These LUTs are reduced in size for easy implementation in Digital Signal Processor (DSP) hardware platforms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
2570611,22736,23735,Reexamining Lucas-Kanade method for real-time independent motion detection: Application to the iCub humanoid robot,2011,"Visual motion is a simple yet powerful cue widely used by biological systems to improve their perception and adaptation to the environment. Examples of tasks that greatly benefit from the ability to detect movement are object segmentation, 3D scene reconstruction and control of attention. In computer vision several algorithms for computing visual motion and optic flow exist. However their application in robotics is not straightforward as in these platforms visual motion is often dominated by (self) motion produced by the movement of the robot (egomotion) making it difficult to disambiguate between motion induced by the scene dynamics or by the own actions of the robot. Independent motion detection is an active field in computer vision and robotics, however approaches in this area typically require that some models of both the environment and the robot visual system are available and are hardly suitable for real-time control. In this paper we describe the motionCUT, a derivation of the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm that allows detecting moving objects, irrespectively of the egomotion produced by the robot. Our method is purely visual and does not require information other than the images coming from the cameras. As such it can be easily adapted to any robotic platform. The system was tested on a stereo tracking task on the iCub humanoid robot, demonstrating that the algorithm performs well and can easily execute in real-time."
1196842,22736,23735,Control allocation of all-wheel drive vehicles: A longitudinal model,2013,"This paper offers a method to compute the control inputs for an all-wheel drive vehicle that moves along a specified path on rough terrain. The focus of this paper is on longitudinal motion only, using a half-car model with no suspensions. For a given path, we first compute the range of the admissible speeds and accelerations at every point along the path, subject to vehicle dynamics and constraints on the wheel/ground forces. A feasible velocity profile along the path is then computed to respect the admissible speeds and accelerations and satisfy given boundary conditions. While the velocity profile represents the accelerations of the center of mass, it remains to determine the control inputs (torques) for the two independent wheels. The challenge stems from the longitudinal model being an indeterminate system, having two control inputs but only one degree-of-freedom along the specified path. This inherent indeterminacy is resolved by adding a virtual suspension to the rigid vehicle model, which allows to explicitly compute the two individual wheel torques. The method is demonstrated for a vehicle moving at the time optimal speeds over a bump. A dynamic simulation of the vehicle with a stiff suspension shows that the two wheels maintain contact with the ground at all times, despite moving at the ultimate speeds. It is also shown that the all-wheel-drive model produces a larger set of admissible speeds and accelerations, and hence results in faster speeds and shorter motion times than the single drive (front or rear) model."
3008228,22736,23735,iT-Knee: An exoskeleton with ideal torque transmission interface for ergonomic power augmentation,2016,"This work presents the development of iT-Knee, a novel modular knee exoskeleton that makes use of a torque transmission interface to deliver pure assistive torque to the knee articulation, with the objective to act as rehabilitation tool, or a single joint add-on exoskeleton device for power augmentation. The specific kinematics features employed by iT-Knee can accommodate not only the translational of the knee instantaneous center of rotation in the sagittal plane and on its orthogonal direction, but also the knee varus/valgus angle as well as the internal/external rotation tibia movements delivering pure torque only around the flexion/extension movement. This functionality results in superior transparency and comfortability which allow prolonged period of use without generating significant discomfort. The iT-Knee kinematics, its mechanism, implementation, and actuation are introduced. The Self-aligning feature combined with a fast lock/release mounting system on the human leg shortens the setup time required to wear it, increasing its user-friendly perception. iT-Knee uses a torque controlled actuation unit to generate torque around the knee flexion extension enabling the implementation of several interaction control schemes that combine assistive functionality on demand with high back drivability and transparency during unloaded free motions of the human knee. Experimental results are presented and effectively demonstrate the functionality of the iT-Knee device."
747634,22736,23735,Learning sequential tasks interactively from demonstrations and own experience,2013,"Deploying robots to our day-to-day life requires them to have the ability to learn from their environment in order to acquire new task knowledge and to flexibly adapt existing skills to various situations. For typical real-world tasks, it is not sufficient to endow robots with a set of primitive actions. Rather, they need to learn how to sequence these in order to achieve a desired effect on their environment. In this paper, we propose an intuitive learning method for a robot to acquire sequences of motions by combining learning from human demonstrations and reinforcement learning. In every situation, our approach treats both ways of learning as alternative control flows to optimally exploit their strengths without inheriting their shortcomings. Using a Gaussian Process approximation of the state-action sequence value function, our approach generalizes values observed from demonstrated and autonomously generated action sequences to unknown inputs. This approximation is based on a kernel we designed to account for different representations of tasks and action sequences as well as inputs of variable length. From the expected deviation of value estimates, we devise a greedy exploration policy following a Bayesian optimization criterion that quickly converges learning to promising action sequences while protecting the robot from sequences with unpredictable outcome. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to efficiently learn appropriate action sequences in various situations on a manipulation task involving stacked boxes."
810973,22736,23735,Informed RRT*: Optimal sampling-based path planning focused via direct sampling of an admissible ellipsoidal heuristic,2014,"Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are pop- ular in motion planning because they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature. For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that unless this subset is sam- pled directly, the probability of improving a solution becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this subset. The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic guarantees on complete- ness and optimality as RRT* while improving the convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced path-planning algorithms. We show exper- imentally that it outperforms RRT* in rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range of the planning problem."
598754,22736,23845,Autonomy Infused Teleoperation with Application to BCI Manipulation,2015,"Robot teleoperation systems face a common set of challenges including latency, low-dimensional user commands, and asymmetric control inputs. User control with Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exacerbates these problems through especially noisy and erratic low-dimensional motion commands due to the difficulty in decoding neural activity. We introduce a general framework to address these challenges through a combination of computer vision, user intent inference, and arbitration between the human input and autonomous control schemes. Adjustable levels of assistance allow the system to balance the operator's capabilities and feelings of comfort and control while compensating for a task's difficulty. We present experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvement using the shared-control assistance framework on adapted rehabilitation benchmarks with two subjects implanted with intracortical brain-computer interfaces controlling a seven degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator as a prosthetic. Our results further indicate that shared assistance mitigates perceived user difficulty and even enables successful performance on previously infeasible tasks. We showcase the extensibility of our architecture with applications to quality-of-life tasks such as opening a door, pouring liquids from containers, and manipulation with novel objects in densely cluttered environments."
1885417,22736,23735,Cognitive vision for efficient scene processing and object categorization in highly cluttered environments,2009,"One of the key competencies required in modern robots is finding objects in complex environments. For the last decade, significant progress in computer vision and machine learning literatures has increased the recognition performance of well localized objects. However, the performance of these techniques is still far from human performance, especially in cluttered environments. We believe that the performance gap between robots and humans is due in part to humans' use of an attention system. According to cognitive psychology, the human visual system uses two stages of visual processing to interpret visual input. The first stage is a pre-attentive process perceiving scenes fast and coarsely to select potentially interesting regions. The second stage is a more complex process analyzing the regions hypothesized in the previous stage. These two stages play an important role in enabling efficient use of the limited cognitive resources available. Inspired by this biological fact, we propose a visual attentional object categorization approach for robots that enables object recognition in real environments under a critical time limitation. We quantitatively evaluate the performance for recognition of objects in highly cluttered scenes without significant loss of detection rates across several experimental settings."
2035619,22736,23735,Multifunctional behaviors of reconfigurable superbot robots,2007,"Superbot consists of Lego-like but autonomous robotic modules that can reconfigure into different systems for different tasks. Examples of configurable systems include rolling tracks or wheels (for efficient travel), spiders or centipedes (for climbing), snakes (for burrowing in ground), and climbers (for inspection and repair in space). This video shows several configurations and behaviors that are new for modular and reconfigurable robots. Each SuperBot module is a complete robotic system and has a power supply, micro- controllers, sensors, communication, three degrees of freedom, and six connecting faces (front, back, left, right, up and down) to dynamically connect to other modules. This design allows flexible bending, docking, and continuous rotation. A single module can move forward, back, left, right, flip-over, and rotate as a wheel. Modules can communication with each other for totally distributed control and can support arbitrary module reshuffling during their operation. The modules have both internal and external sensors for monitoring self-status and environmental parameters. They can form arbitrary configurations (graphs) and can control these configurations for different functionality such as locomotion, manipulation, and self-repair. This video shows the latest status the SuperBot modules and all these behaviors were made in just one week. The fact that SuperBot can achieve so much in so short a time demonstrates the unique value of modular, multifunctional and self-reconfigurable robots."
2976513,22736,23735,Towards automatic robot-assisted microscopy: An uncalibrated approach for robotic vision-guided micromanipulation,2016,"Micromanipulation during live microscopic imaging relies heavily on good manual controls, dexterity, and hand-eye coordination. However, unassisted manual operations in these procedures greatly limit the speed, repeatability, and ease of operation. This is especially challenging in the case of microinjection where the insertion path needs to be in precise alignment with the imaging plane to avoid damage to cells. In this paper, we proposed an assistive robotic system that facilitates micromanipulation under microscopy. This comes in the form of intelligent robotic vision and guided manipulation. Using user-selected patch similarity, the system registers target templates and provides online coordinated depth compensation that ensures in-plane microinjection without the need for any prior calibration. This vision-based auto-registration approach readily integrates to any existing microscope system uncalibrated. It can also work as a standalone imaging solution with any general digital microscope camera. Experiments show that the similarity-score based depth compensation performed better than the uncompensated method. The method was shown to self-recover from an unfocused position. By robotizing conventional microscopy and micromanipulation procedures, we hope to address traditional latent needs and open up new possibilities in the ways experimental biology is performed."
1785929,22736,23735,Surgical Case Identification for an Image-Guided Interventional System,2010,"Image-guided surgery offers great advantages to surgeons through the possibility to track tools in 3D space and to navigate based on the virtual model of the patient. In the case of robot-assisted procedures, both the inherent accuracy of the system components and the quality of the registration procedures are critical to provide high precision treatment delivery. One of the major barriers towards more technology-integrated procedures is the fact that alterations in the operating room environment can fundamentally change the performance of the system, decrease the accuracy, and therefore pose significant danger to the patient. Surgical events from the control point of view may include motion of the robot, motion of the camera, or motion of the patient. The paper describes a new concept to treat these events, to track and automatically compensate for abrupt changes that may affect the accuracy of a robot-integrated interventional system. Our solution is to use all available information at a given time, including the intra-operative tracker's internal base frame, to distinguish between different surgical events. The concept has been developed and tested on the neurosurgical robot system at the Johns Hopkins University. Initial experiments performed on data recordings from simulated scenarios showed that the algorithm was able to correctly identify the cases."
948827,22736,23735,Linear multi-modal actuation through discrete coupling,2012,"Due to technological limitations robot actuators are often designed for specific tasks with narrow performance goals, whereas a wide range of output and behaviours is necessary for robots to operate autonomously in uncertain complex environments. We present a design framework that employs dynamic couplings in the form of brakes and clutches to increase the performance and diversity of linear actuators. The couplings are used to switch between a diverse range of discrete modes of operation within a single actuator. We also provide a design solution for miniaturized couplings that use dry friction to produce rapid switching and high braking forces. The couplings are designed so that once engaged or disengaged no extra energy is consumed. We apply the design framework and coupling design to a linear series elastic actuator (SEA) and show that this relatively simple implementation increases the performance and adds new behaviours to the standard design. Through a number of performance tests we are able to show rapid switching between a high and a low impedance output mode; that the actuator's spring can be charged to produce short bursts of high output power; and that the actuator has additional passive and rigid modes that consume no power once activated. Robots using actuators from this design framework would see a vast increase in their behavioural diversity and improvements in their performance not yet possible with conventional actuator design."
909994,22736,23735,Learning and generalizing force control policies for sculpting,2012,"Humans exhibit exceptional skills in using tools and manipulating objects of their environment by skillfully controlling exerted force and arm impedance. One of the basic components of this mechanism is the generation of internal models which associate kinematic variables with applied force. On the other hand, making robots capable of skillfully using tools and adapting their motor behavior to new environmental conditions is rather complex. In the present paper, we investigate learning of force control policies for robotic sculpting given multiple task demonstrations. These policies express the relationship between constrained motions and exerted force and are learned in Cartesian space where the coupling of dynamics between different directions of motion is also taken into account. In addition, a novel algorithm is proposed to generalize these policies to new motion tasks, executed in a sufficiently homogeneous environment, same with that in demonstrations, but in presence of new motion-dependent external forces. To this aim, a differential calculus approach is proposed where not only the mapping from motion to force but also from difference in motion to difference in force is learned to generalize the policies to new contexts. This is achieved by learning apart from a set of policy parameters, some newly introduced quantities, so called weight differentials, which express the rate of change of the policy parameters. The proposed approach is validated in simple real-world sculpting experiments by using a two degrees-of-freedom haptic device."
1298154,22736,23735,Touch attention Bayesian models for robotic active haptic exploration of heterogeneous surfaces,2014,"This work contributes to the development of active haptic exploration strategies of surfaces using robotic hands in environments with an unknown structure. The architecture of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian models, implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system. The model π per  perceives and discriminates different categories of materials (haptic stimulus) integrating compliance and texture features extracted from haptic sensory data. The model π tar  actively infers the next region of the workspace that should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty maps extracted from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well as, inhibition-of-return mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian model π per  can be used to discriminate 10 different classes of materials with an average recognition rate higher than 90%. The generalization capability of the proposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two regions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30 trials). The tests were performed in scenarios with 3 different configurations of the discontinuity. The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces and sensory noise to make correct motor decisions from haptic percepts."
2616349,22736,23735,Personal robot assisting transportation to support active human life,2015,"Advanced countries are currently experiencing an aging society, and many people could benefit from a personal robot that can support a comfortable lifestyle. However, excessive and premature robot assistance may deteriorate the user's physical abilities and can accelerate their aging process. The authors have already proposed a personal robot that can follow the user, even on uneven road surfaces. Therefore, people utilizing this personal robot do not need to carry heavy baggage, even after shopping. It is reported that a few brisk walks per week can be advantageous to our health management and can improve our quality of life, so this means that the personal robot can encourage the user to maintain an active lifestyle. For this personal robot, close following is required to ensure the safety of the baggage and the personal robot. However, it is difficult for the conventional approach to avoid collisions when the user stops suddenly. In this paper, a control approach based on model predictive control is proposed to achieve two conflicting requirements: close following and no collision. The proposed approach predicts multiple future outcomes, in which the user either stops or accelerates in the next step, in order to realize an appropriate relative distance and to consider the upper and lower boundaries for posture stabilization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach can be verified in numerical simulations using a multibody dynamics model consisting of actual 3D representations."
2969679,22736,23735,Motion planning with diffusion maps,2016,"Many robotic applications require repeated, on-demand motion planning in mapped environments. In addition, the presence of other dynamic agents, such as people, often induces frequent, dynamic changes in the environment. Having a potential function that encodes pairwise cost-to-go can be useful for improving the computational speed of finding feasible paths, and for guiding local searches around dynamic obstacles. However, since storing pairwise potential can be impractical given the O(|V| 2 ) memory requirement, existing work often needs to compute a potential function for each query to a new goal, which would require a substantial online computation. This work addresses the problem by using diffusion maps, a machine learning algorithm, to learn the map's geometry and develop a memory-efficient parametrization (O(|V|)) of pairwise potentials. Specially, each state in the map is transformed to a diffusion coordinate, in which pairwise Euclidean distance is shown to be a meaningful similarity metric. We develop diffusion-based motion planning algorithms and, through extensive numerical evaluation, show that the proposed algorithms find feasible paths of similar quality with orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed compared with single-query methods. The proposed algorithms are implemented on hardware to enable real-time autonomous navigation in an indoor environment with frequent interactions with pedestrians."
2022605,22736,23735,Step climbing capability of a 4WD omnidirectional wheelchair,2008,"This paper presents analysis and experiments of a 4WD omnidirectional wheelchair for climbing a high step. For enhancing the mobility and maneuverability of standard wheelchairs, a new type of omnidirectional mobile platform with four-wheel drive (4WD) mechanism is introduced. The mobile platform equips four wheels, two omni-wheels in front and two normal tires in rear. The normal wheel and the omni-wheel, mounted on the same side of the base, are interconnected by belt transmissions to rotate in unison with a drive motor, i.e. a synchro-drive transmission. To rotate a chair at the center of the mobile base about vertical axis, the third motor is installed on the platform. The prototype wheelchair with the proposed 4WD system is capable of moving in any direction and climbing over a high single step. The conventional 4WD system provides enhanced step climb capability. However the maximum step height is restricted by the rear wheels. Namely, front wheels can climb up higher step than the rear wheels although the both wheels are identical in diameter. To clarify the difference between front and rear wheels in the step climb capability, the statics of the 4WD system is analyzed. It is suggested that the reaction of a drive torque cause the front-rear differences and its influence depends on a wheelbase and a vehicle weight distribution ratio between front and rear wheel axes. For varying a vehicle weight distribution ratio, we develop a chair tilting mechanism for the 4WD wheelchair with a linear drive mechanism controlled by a stability algorithm using an inclinometer. To verify the analysis results and availability of the chair tilting mechanism, step climb capabilities of a 4WD wheelchair prototype is tested in experiments. In the experiments, both front and rear wheels of the prototype wheelchair with a human can successfully climb a 90 mm step while the rear wheels fail when the chair tilting system is disabled."
2627193,22736,23735,Stochastic Ensemble Simulation motion planning in stochastic dynamic environments,2015,"Motion planning in stochastic dynamic environments is difficult due to the need for constant plan adjustment caused by the uncertainty of the environment. There are many motion planning problems, including flight coordination and autonomous vehicles, that require an algorithm to predict obstacle motion and plan safely. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (SES)-based planning, a novel framework to efficiently predict and produce safe trajectories in the presence of stochastic obstacles. The stochastic obstacles can be introduced in several ways including stochastic motion or position/speed uncertainty. SES-based planning works by first predicting an obstacle's future position offline through an ensemble of Monte Carlo simulations. These runs simulate the stochastic obstacle dynamics and store the simulation results in temporal snapshots of predicted positions. An online planner then uses this output to identify a predicted collision-free direct path to the goal. If the direct path is not expected to be collision-free, a more expensive tree-based planner is used. Our experiments show SES-based planning outperforms other methods that have high planning success in environments with 900 stochastically moving obstacles. Furthermore, our method plans trajectories with an 80% success rate for a 7 DOF robot in an environment with 250 stochastic moving obstacles and 50 obstacles with speed/position uncertainty. This complex problem is currently beyond the capability of several comparison methods."
2069091,22736,23735,An extended Kalman filter for quaternion-based orientation estimation using MARG sensors,2001,"Presents an extended Kalman filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation using the newly developed MARG (magnetic, angular rate, and gravity) sensors. Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation. A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time. Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels. In all cases the filter was able to converge and accurately track rotational motions."
787771,22736,23735,Compact self-contained navigation system with MEMS inertial sensor and optical navigation sensor for 3-D pipeline mapping,2010,"We propose a compact self-contained navigation system with Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) inertial sensor and optical navigation sensor for 3-D pipeline mapping. Self-contained navigation system have advantages of robust against severe environmental conditions and also wide applications without external assist such as Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation or localization system based on a map. The goal of this study is to overcome the performance limitations of small, low-grade sensors by combining various sensors with complementary functions and, therefore, to achieve robust tracking performance against severe environmental conditions. The multi-rate EKF solves the frequent outage problem of the optical navigation sensors and the bias drift problem of the MEMS accelerometers. The vector matching algorithm with the gravity field vector solves the bias drift problem of the MEMS gyro except for the yaw in the reference axis. The geometry compensation algorithm minimizes position errors by combining the forward and backward estimation results geometrically. Experiments to verify performance are conducted by driving Radio-Controlled (RC) car equipped with the proposed navigation system on 3-D asphalt pavement. Experimental results show that the proposed navigation system has good performance and estimated position errors are less than one percent, in the range of 855 m. The proposed navigation system can contribute a compact size and robustness not only to 3-D pipeline mapping but also to small mobile robots."
2668290,22736,23735,"A bio-inspired tensegrity manipulator with multi-DOF, structurally compliant joints",2016,"Most traditional robotic mechanisms feature inelastic joints that are unable to robustly handle large deformations and off-axis moments. As a result, the applied loads are transferred rigidly throughout the entire structure. The disadvantage of this approach is that the exerted leverage is magnified at each subsequent joint possibly damaging the mechanism. In this paper, we present two lightweight, elastic, bio-inspired tensegrity robotic arms adapted from prior static models which mitigate this danger while improving their mechanism's functionality. Our solutions feature modular tensegrity structures that function similarly to the human elbow and the human shoulder when connected. Like their biological counterparts, the proposed robotic joints are flexible and comply with unanticipated forces. Both proposed structures have multiple passive degrees of freedom and four active degrees of freedom (two from the shoulder and two from the elbow). The structural advantages demonstrated by the joints in these manipulators illustrate a solution to the fundamental issue of elegantly handling off-axis compliance. Additionally, this initial experiment illustrates that moving tensegrity arms must be designed with large reachable and dexterous workspaces in mind, a change from prior tensegrity arms which were only static. These initial experiments should be viewed as an exploration into the design space of active tensegrity structures, particularly those inspired by biological joints and limbs."
2629120,22736,23735,A new design of a fingertip for the iCub hand,2015,"Tactile sensing is of fundamental importance for object manipulation and perception. Several sensors for hands have been proposed in the literature, however, only a few of them can be fully integrated with robotic hands. Typical problems preventing integration include the need for deformable sensors that can be deployed on curved surfaces, and wiring complexity. In this paper we describe a fingertip for the hands of the iCub robot, each fingertip consists of 12 sensors. Our approach builds on previous work on the iCub tactile system. The sensing elements of the fingertip are capacitive sensors made from a flexible PCB, and a multi-layer fabric that includes the dielectric material and the conductive layer. The novelty the proposed sensor lies in incorporating the multi-layer fabric technology into a small fingertip sensor that can be attached to the hands of a humanoid robot. The new sensors are more robust. The manufacturing is easier and relies on industrial techniques for the fabrication of the components, which results in higher repeatability. We performed experimental characterization of the sensor. We show that the sensor is able to detect forces as low as 0.05 N with no cross-talk between the taxels. We identified some hysteresis in the response of the sensor which must be taken into account if the robot exerts large forces for a long period of time. The taxels have spatially overlapping receptive fields, this has been demonstrated to be a useful property that allows hyperacuity."
880230,22736,23735,Scheduling operator attention for Multi-Robot Control,2012,"A wide class of multirobot control tasks involves operator interactions with individual robots. Where the robots' actions are independent, as for example in some foraging tasks, the operator can interact with robots sequentially in a round robin fashion. If the need for interaction can be detected by the robot through self-reflection, the robot could communicate its need for interaction to the operator. The resulting human-robot system would form a queuing system in which the operator is the server and the queue of robots requesting interaction, the jobs. As a queuing system, performance could be optimized using standard techniques, providing the operator's attention could be appropriately directed. An earlier study found that Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) performance was improved by communicating requests for interaction to the operator, however, a first-in-first-out (FIFO) aid showing a single request at a time led to poorer performance than one showing the entire (Open) queue. The current experiment compared Open-queue and FIFO conditions from the first experiment with a Priority-queue using a shortest job first (SJF) discipline known to maximize throughput. Performance in the Priority-queue condition was statistically indistinguishable from the best performance for all measures except those for missed victims where it was intermediate between FIFO (best) and Open-queue. Both of the other conditions produced poorest performance on some measures. The results suggest that operator attention can be effectively scheduled allowing the use of scheduling algorithms to improve the efficiency of HRI."
2552380,22736,23735,Towards table tennis with a quadrotor autonomous learning robot and onboard vision,2015,"Robot table tennis is a challenging domain in both robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In terms of robotics, it requires fast and reliable perception and control; in terms of artificial intelligence, it requires fast decision making to determine the best motion to hit the ball; in terms of machine learning, it requires the ability to accurately estimate where and when the ball will be so that it can be hit. The use of sophisticated perception (relying, for example, in multi-camera vision systems) and state-of-the-art robot manipulators significantly alleviates concerns with perception and control, leaving room for the exploration of novel approaches that focus on estimating where, when and how to hit the ball. In this paper, we move away from the hardware setup commonly used in this domain—typically relying on robotic manipulators combined with an array of multiple fixed cameras—and give the first steps towards having autonomous aerial table tennis robotic players. Specifically, we focus on the task of hitting a ping pong ball thrown at a commercial drone, equipped with a light cardboard racket and an onboard camera. We adopt a general framework for learning complex robot tasks and show that, in spite of the perceptual and actuation limitations of our system, the overall approach enables the quadrotor system to successfully respond to balls served by a human user."
849084,22736,23735,Force and moment generation of fiber-reinforced pneumatic soft actuators,2013,"Soft actuators are found throughout nature from elephant trunks to round worms, demonstrating large specific forces without the need for sliding components. These actuators offer impact resilience, human-safe interaction, versatility of motion, and scalability in size. Biological structures often use a fiber-reinforcement around a fluid filled elastomeric enclosure, in which the elastomeric material will capture the distributed pressure and transfer it to the fibers, which will in turn direct the forces to the ends. We previously discovered an entire domain of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs), of which McKibben actuators are a small subset. The range of forces and moments possible with FREEs has not been previously investigated. 45 FREE actuators across the span of fiber angle configurations were fabricated and tested. The reaction force and moment of each actuator was determined across a gamut of pressures. Analytical models were generated using a variety of simplifying assumptions. These models were created to provide a closed form expression that models the force and moment data. The models were compared to the experimental values to determine their fit; this provides an understanding of which simplifying kinematic assumptions best represent the experimental results. Interpolated experimental results and the analytical models are all graphically represented for use as an intuitive design tool."
2245217,22736,23735,An adaptive vision system for guidance of a robotic manipulator to capture a tumbling satellite with unknown dynamics,2008,"This paper is focused on an adaptive vision system for the guidance of a robot to intercept a non-cooperative target satellite with unknown dynamics parameters. A Kalman filter is developed to reliably estimate the states of the object as well as all of its inertial parameters - namely, the moment-of-inertia ratios, the center-of-mass location, and the orientation of the principle axes - from vision information. The estimates are then used to optimally plan the motion of the manipulator. The optimization performance index includes the time of travel and the weighted norms of the end-effector velocity and acceleration, and it is subject to the conditions that the robot end-effector and the satellite gasping point arrive at the rendezvous point with the same velocity and that the interception occurs within the robot reach. The variational method is used to find the optimal path, which turns out to be the solution of a fourth-order differential equation. Subsequently, a closed-form solution is obtained. The solution to the optimal terminal-time problem is also obtained from the Hamiltonian of the entire system. Experiments are conducted by using a robotic arm to move a satellite mockup according to orbital mechanics and measuring the satellite pose by a laser camera system. The results demonstrate a successful grasping even though the inertial parameters are not known by the control system."
1481560,22736,23735,Haptic localization and shape recognition of Nano Objects,2012,"Manipulations of submicron objects on a surface with a scanning force probe required a precise localization and shape recognition in order to perform controlled displacements and/or actions on them. As these submicron objects are closed to the optical detection limit of classical optical microscopy, we propose to combine an AFM tip mounted on a quartz tuning fork resonator and a high performance haptic system. The whole system acts as a nano-finger/tool. In this paper two main configurations of the haptic coupling have been tested: (1) a full manual control configuration where the operator pilots manually the AFM probe displacements in (X,Y,Z) directions and then feels and adjusts the tip-surface interaction, (2) a collaborative human-robot configuration where the operator pilots only (X,Y) directions while the standard feedback loop of the AFM probe controls the tip-sample interaction to keep it constant. In both cases, the experimentalist successes in a localization task while in the recognition task the assisted configuration (2) only provides reliable and reproducible results without tip damage. A critical analysis of the results and the haptic recognition process is reported in the last section to discuss about the haptic representation based only on the vertical direction while the common and classical representation is based on the normal direction of the sample surface. Finally a third configuration to pass from localization and recognition mode to nano-manipulation mode is proposed."
2633349,22736,23735,Using sensory data fusion methods for infant body posture assessment,2015,"Infant body posture assessment is very important for monitoring the development of motor skills. The currently utilized sensory-supported measurement systems are often subject to shortcomings, such as system complexity or inaccuracy. This paper presents a novel approach integrating a combination of a pressure mattress along with inertial and magnetic measurement units on infant trunk and arms to diminish the effects of such drawbacks. The proposed multi-sensor system is validated by comparison of kinematic parameters, such as head movement, arm workspace area, and spectral arc length of hand velocity data to results of a referential optoelectronic measurement system. Integration of sensory data fusion methods provides high system accuracy and reliability. Acquired results confirm that the proposed system can be used as an adequate substitution to expensive optoelectronic measurement systems, as the arm kinematic estimation errors are in the range of 2 cm. Also presented are the results of simplified system versions with only 1 IMU per arm. Such approaches however result in lower system complexity, but also lower accuracy. Nevertheless results imply that the arm posture and workspace assessment is still reliable enough for frequent practical use. By taking into account all the evaluation results, the proposed measurement system could importantly contribute to the field of sensory-supported infant body posture assessment."
1650416,22736,23735,An Approach to Sociable Robots through Self-distributed Energy,2006,"Research of autonomous mobile robots has mostly emphasized interaction and coordination that are natually inspired from biological behavior of birds, insects, and fish: flocking, foraging, collecting, and sharing. However, most research has been only focused on autonomous behaviors in order to perform robots like animals, whereas it is lacked of determinant to those behaviours: energy. Approaching to clusted amimal and the higher, collective and sharing food among individuals are major activity to keep society being. This paper issues an approach to sociable robots using self-maintained energy in cooperative mobile robots, which is dominantly inspired from swarm behavior of collecting and sharing food of honey-bee and ant. Autonomous mobile robots are usually equipped with a finite energy, thus they can operate in a finite time. To overcome the finitude, we describe practical deployment of mobile robots that are capable of carrying and exchanging fuel to other robots. Mechanism implementation including modular hardware and control architecture to demonstrate the capabicities of the approach is presented. Subsequently, the battery exchange algorithm basically based on probabilistic modeling of total energy on each robot located in its local vicinity is described. The paper is concluded with challenging works of chain of mobile robots, rescue, repair, and relation of heterogeneous robots."
852893,22736,23735,Pano-presence for teleoperation,2005,"Telepresence and teleoperation are immersive viewing and control by a user from a remote location. Usual implementations use a standard narrow field of view (FOV) camera and a communications link, and a head mounted display (HMD). Teleoperating a robotic vehicle or surveying a scene with such system and a computer monitor is difficult for human operators due to the narrow FOV of standard cameras, the unintuitive interface for directing the camera, and the loss of directional sense. For this reason these systems often use a head mounted display (HMD) instead of a monitor, however this introduces the HMD pose latency problem of latency and slow update due to the mechanical motion of the camera and the communications link. Even with good equipment, the experience is disorienting and slow. This paper proposes a pano-presence architecture for telepresence for applications such as teleoperation based on panoramic cameras, a communications link, and an HMD. The panoramic camera, capable of capturing light from all azimuth directions, provides a panorama which is be transported over the communications link to a panorama frame buffer for viewing in the HMD screen(s). The panorama viewing rate is decoupled from the communications latency so the user can look around freely without experiencing HMD pose latency problem, the delay in the HMD's image alignment with the head position. A panorama frame format of an image cube is chosen since it can be viewed at full frame rate with the acceleration in consumer graphics cards. Two prototype systems, one telepresence and one teleoperation, using this architecture are described."
2678989,22736,9579,Design and Evaluation of a Rapid Programming System for Service Robots,2016,"This paper introduces CustomPrograms, a rapid programming system for mobile service robots. With CustomPrograms, roboticists can quickly create new behaviors and try unexplored use cases for commercialization. In our system, the robot has a set of primitive capabilities, such as navigating to a location or interacting with users on a touch screen. Users can then compose these primitives with general-purpose programming language constructs like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. The programming language is wrapped in a graphical interface. This allows inexperienced or novice programmers to benefit from the system as well.   We describe the design and implementation of  CustomPrograms  on a Savioke Relay robot in detail. Based on interviews conducted with Savioke roboticists, designers, and business people, we learned of several potential new use cases for the robot. We characterize our system's ability to fulfill these use cases. Additionally, we conducted a user study of the interface with Savioke employees and outside programmers. We found that experienced programmers could learn to use the interface and create 3 real-world programs during the 90 minute study. Inexperienced programmers were less likely to create complex programs correctly. We provide an analysis of the errors made during the study, and highlight the most common pieces of feedback we received. Two case studies show how the system was used internally at Savioke and at a major trade show."
2606392,22736,23735,Optimization-based design of a novel hybrid aerial/ground mobile manipulator,2015,"This paper is concerned with the mechanical design of a mobile manipulating unmanned ground vehicle (MM-UGV) coupled with an existing commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to create a novel hybrid aerial/ground mobile manipulator. A novel systematic optimization-based approach is presented for making important design choices, such as the selection of gearboxes and electric DC motors in the drive-train, manipulator link lengths, and UGV base length. The objective is to minimize the overall mass of the MM-UGV. Constraints related to workspace, dynamic tip-over stability, actuator torque/force limits in static and dynamic motions, executed in the air or on the ground, and battery properties are incorporated into the problem formulation. The system operating conditions in the form of the range of end-effector forces, operating surface grade, and various position, velocity and acceleration variables are provided by the designer. The resulting problem is a robust bilevel nonlinear optimization, in which some of the constraints are derived from maximization/minimization over the operational variables to ensure constraint satisfaction in all possible operation scenarios. The problem is solved using a genetic algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy produces a design that meets the user-specified requirements."
2282630,22736,23735,Automatic synthesis of communication-based coordinated multi-robot systems,2004,"To enable the successful deployment of task-achieving multi-robot systems (MRS), coordination mechanisms must be utilized in order to effectively mediate the interactions between the robots and the task environment. Over the past decade, there have been a number of elegant experimentally demonstrated MRS coordination mechanisms. Most of these mechanisms have been task-specific in nature, typically providing only empirical insights into coordination design and little in the way of systematic techniques to assist in the design of coordinated MRS for new task domains. To fully realize the potentials of MRS, formally-grounded systematic techniques amenable to analysis are needed in order to facilitate the design of coordinated MRS. We address this problem by presenting a formal framework for describing and reasoning about coordination in a MRS. Using this principled foundation, we are developing a suite of general methods for automatically synthesizing the controllers of robots constituting a MRS such that the given task is performed in a coordinated fashion. This paper presents a method for the automatic synthesis of a specific type of controller, one that is stateless but capable of inter-robot communication. We also present a graph coloring-based approach for minimizing the number of necessary unique communication messages. The synthesis of such communicative controllers provides a means for assessing the uses and limitations of communication in MRS coordination. We present experimental validation of our formal approach of controller synthesis in a multi-robot construction domain through physically-realistic simulations and in real-robot demonstrations."
1646747,22736,23735,Multi-robot exploration of unknown environments with identification of exploration completion and post-exploration rendezvous using ant algorithms,2013,"This paper presents a new ant algorithm for the navigation of several robots, whose objective is to autonomously explore an unknown environment. When the coverage is completed, all robots move to a previously defined meeting point. The approach that we propose in this paper for solving this problem, considers that the robots build, while moving, a common and shared representation of the environment. In this representation, the environment is viewed as a graph (typically a set of connected cells in a regular grid), each grid cell having a local memory able to store a limited amount of data. A robot can write numbers on the cell on which it is lying. It can also read the values of the cells in its neighborhood, and perform some simple operations, such as computing the minimum of a set of values. Each robot is capable, contrary to most ant-based approaches, to determine, in a distributed way, when the environment coverage has completed. Few ant algorithms can do that. Brick&Mortar is one of them and this is why it retains a central place in our proposition. The novelty of our approach is that, due to an emerging property of the underlying algorithm, agents will finish their exploration at a predefined evacuation point. In addition, several improvements of the original Brick&Mortar algorithm are proposed in this paper, such as the possibility to use better local strategies at the robot level (using, for example, LRTA*). The paper also presents a set of benchmarks against the best existing ant algorithms on several widespread graph topologies."

With the goal of finding optimal wing shapes for flapping-gliding robots we evaluate the quasi-steady aerodynamic performance of four butterfly species (Monarch (Danaus plexippus), the Orange Aeroplane (Pantoporia consimilis), the Glasswing (Acraea andromacha) and the Four-barred Swordtail (Protographium Ieosthenes)). We fabricate at-scale wing models based on measured wing shapes and vary the forewing angle in nine steps to account for the ability of the butterfly to change the relative orientation of its forewing and hindwing during flight. For comparison we include twelve non-biological planforms as performance benchmarks for the butterfly wing shapes. We then test these 48 wing models at 2m/s, 3.5m/s and 5m/s (Reynolds number between 2597 and 12632) in a low speed wind tunnel which allows lift and drag force measurements of centimeter-size wings. The results indicate that the forewing orientation which maximizes the wing span offers the best gliding performance and that overall the gliding ratios are highest at 3.5m/s. The wing shapes with the best gliding ratio are found in the Glasswing butterfly with a maximum of 6.26 which is very high compared to the gliding performance of similarly sized flying robots. The results from this study are important for the development of novel biologically-inspired flying micro robots as well as for biomechanics studies in biology."
2371254,22736,23735,GPS accuracy improvement by satellite selection using omnidirectional infrared camera,2008,"This paper describes a precision positioning technique that can be applied to vehicles in urban areas. The proposed technique mitigates GPS multipath by means of an omnidirectional infrared (IR) camera that can eliminate the need for invisible satellites (a satellite detected by the receiver but without LOS (Line Of Sight)) by using IR images. Some simple GPS multipath mitigation techniques such as installation of antennas away from buildings and using choke ring antennas are well known. Further, various correlator techniques can also be employed. However, when a direct signal cannot be received by the antenna, these techniques do not provide satisfactory results because they presume that the antenna chiefly receives direct signals. On the other hand, the proposed technique can mitigate GPS multipath even if a direct signal cannot be received because it can recognize the surrounding environment by means of an omnidirectional IR camera. With the IR camera, the sky appears distinctively dark; this facilitates the detection of the borderline between the sky and the surrounding buildings, which are captured in white, due to the difference in the atmospheric transmittance rate between visible light and the IR rays. Positioning is performed only with visible satellites having less multipath errors, and without using invisible satellites. With the proposed system, static and kinematic evaluations in which invisible satellites are discriminated through observation using an omnidirectional IR camera are conducted. Hence, signals are received even if satellites are hidden behind buildings; furthermore, exclusion of satellites having large errors from the positioning computation becomes possible. The evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the feasibility of highly accurate positioning."
2606350,22736,23735,IRON: A fast interest point descriptor for robust NDT-map matching and its application to robot localization,2015,"This work introduces the IRON keypoint detector and the IRON descriptor which enable high-speed and high-accuracy alignment of 3D depth maps. Instead of using raw point values for storing 3D-scenes, all algorithms were designed to operate on Normal Distribution Transforms (NDT), since NDT-maps provide a highly memory-efficient representation of depth data. By taking into account surface curvature and object shape within NDT-maps, patches with strong surface variability can be recognized and described precisely. In this paper, the whole feature extraction process, as well as descriptor matching, outlier detection, and the final transform calculation between NDT-maps is elaborated. The presented technique is particularly insensitive to an initial offset between both maps, has a high robustness, and it achieves more than 75 NDT-map alignments per second (including complete memory allocation each time as well) in two large publicly available depth datasets while using only a single core of a modern Intel i7 CPU. Even though the main focus of this work was placed on the proposed IRON registration algorithm, two specific applications of this NDT-matching approach are outlined in the second part, namely robot pose tracking and NDT-one-shot localization within densely furnished domestic environments."
821667,22736,23735,A quasi-passive model of human leg function in level-ground walking,2006,"In this paper, we seek to understand how leg muscles and tendons work mechanically during walking in order to motivate the design of efficient robotic legs. We hypothesize that a robotic leg comprising only knee and ankle passive and quasi-passive elements, including springs, clutches and variable-damping components, can capture the dominant mechanical behavior of the human knee and ankle during level-ground walking at self-selected speeds. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, we put forth a simple leg model that captures the gross features of the human leg musculoskeletal architecture. We vary model parameters, or spring constants, damping levels and times when clutches are engaged, using an optimization scheme where errors between model joint behaviours and biological joint mechanics are minimized. For model evaluation, kinetic and kinematic gait data are employed from a single participant walking across a level-ground surface at a self-selected gait speed (1.3 m/sec). With only a single hip actuator, we find good agreement between model predictions and experimental gait data, suggesting that knee and ankle actuators are not necessary for level-ground robotic ambulation at self-selected gait speeds. This result is in support of the idea that muscles that span the human knee and ankle mainly operate eccentrically or isometrically, affording the relatively high metabolic walking economy of humans"
991505,22736,23735,Energy efficient trajectory generation for a state-space based JPL Aerobot,2010,"The 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 project with man landing on the moon reminds the world again by what science and engineering can do if the man is determined to do. However, a huge step can only be achieved step by step which may be relatively small at the beginning. Robotic exploration can provide necessary information needed to do the further step safely, with less cost, more conveniently. Trajectory generation for a robotic vehicle is an essential part of the total mission planning. To save energy by exploiting possible resources such as wind will assist a robotic explorer extend its life span and perform tasks more reliably. In this paper, we propose to utilize Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) methodology to generate energy efficient trajectores for the JPL Aerobot by exploiting wind. The Aerobot model is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral dynamics with control inputs as elevator deflection δ e , thrust demand δ T , vectoring angle δ v  for the longitudinal motion, aileron deflection δ a , rudder deflection δ r  for the lateral motion. The outputs are the velocities and orientation of the Aerobot. The Aerobot state space model parameters are obtained from experimental identification on AURORA Airship since the actual JPL Aerobot is similar to the AURORA Airship. In this paper, the results show that with the state-space model, the proposed trajectory generation method can guide the Aerobot to take advantage of previously known wind profile to generate an energy-efficient trajectory."
2592021,22736,23735,Task-centric selection of robot and environment initial configurations for assistive tasks,2015,"When a mobile manipulator functions as an assistive device, the robot's initial configuration and the configuration of the environment can impact the robot's ability to provide effective assistance. Selecting initial configurations for assistive tasks can be challenging due to the high number of degrees of freedom of the robot, the environment, and the person, as well as the complexity of the task. In addition, rapid selection of initial conditions can be important, so that the system will be responsive to the user and will not require the user to wait a long time while the robot makes a decision. To address these challenges, we present Task-centric initial Configuration Selection (TCS), which unlike previous work uses a measure of task-centric manipulability to accommodate state estimation error, considers various environmental degrees of freedom, and can find a set of configurations from which a robot can perform a task. TCS performs substantial offline computation, so that it can rapidly provide solutions at run time. At run time, the system performs an optimization over candidate initial configurations using a utility function that can include factors such as movement costs for the robot's mobile base. To evaluate TCS, we created models of 11 activities of daily living (ADLs) and evaluated TCS's performance with these 11 assistive tasks in a computer simulation of a PR2, a robotic bed, and a model of a human body. TCS performed as well or better than a baseline algorithm in all of our tests against state estimation error."
2572734,22736,23735,A sensorimotor approach for self-learning of hand-eye coordination,2015,"This paper presents a sensorimotor contingencies (SMC) based method to fully autonomously learn to perform hand-eye coordination. We divide the task into two visuomotor subtasks, visual fixation and reaching, and implement these on a PR2 robot assuming no prior information on its kinematic model. Our contributions are three-fold: i) grounding a robot in the environment by exploiting SMCs in the action planning system, which eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the kinematic or dynamic models of the robot; ii) using a forward model to search for proper actions to solve the task by minimizing a cost function, instead of training a separate inverse model, to speed up training; iii) encoding 3D spatial positions of a target object based on the robot's joint positions, thus avoiding calibration with respect to an external coordinate system. The method is capable of learning the task of hand-eye coordination from scratch by less than 20 sensory-motor pairs that are iteratively generated at real-time speed. In order to examine the robustness of the method while dealing with nonlinear image distortions, we apply a so-called retinal mapping image deformation to the input images. Experimental results show the successfulness of the method even under considerable image deformations."
444684,22736,23735,Biologically-inspired visual scanning sensor for stabilization and tracking,1999,"Describes a sensor designed to ensure the non-contact stabilization of a craft and especially to deal with disturbance problems such as those resulting from slow speed angular drift. A low-cost, low-complexity active vision system is described, which is based on the specific eye movements occurring in the compound eye of the fly. In our system, motion is detected and processed by a local motion detector circuit (LMD). First, the rotation of two photosensors at a constant angular speed was simulated, which emphasized motion processing as a useful means of detecting variably contrasted objects, however far ahead they are located. Secondly, we reasoned that if the pair of photosensors turns at a varying angular speed the signal delivered by the LMD will vary depending on the position of the contrast feature located in the sensor's visual field. The validity of this reasoning was then tested by constructing a miniature scanning sensor, the output voltage of which turned out to be a quasi-linear function of the position of the contrast feature present in the visual field and to be largely independent of the distance and the level of contrast. This output can therefore be used to generate the appropriate motor commands for stabilizing a sensory platform subject to yaw, pitch, or roll in relation to environmental features and/or for tracking contrasting objects."
1711139,22736,23735,Automatic drive annotation via multimodal latent topic model,2013,"Time-series driving behavioral data and image sequences captured with car-mounted video cameras can be annotated automatically in natural language, for example, “in a traffic jam,” “leading vehicle is a truck,” or “there are three and more lanes.” Various driving support systems nowadays have been developed for safe and comfortable driving. To develop more effective driving assist systems, abstractive recognition of driving situation performed just like a human driver is important in order to achieve fully cooperative driving between the driver and vehicle. To achieve human-like annotation of driving behavioral data and image sequences, we first divided continuous driving behavioral data into discrete symbols that represent driving situations. Then, using multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation, latent driving topics laid on each driving situation were estimated as a relation model among driving behavioral data, image sequences, and human-annotated tags. Finally, automatic annotation of the behavioral data and image sequences can be achieved by calculating the predictive distribution of the annotations via estimated latent-driving topics. The proposed method intuitively annotated more than 50,000 pieces of frame data, including urban road and expressway data. The effectiveness of the estimated drive topics was also evaluated by analyzing the performances of driving-situation classification. The topics represented the drive context efficiently, i.e., the drive topics lead to a 95% lower-dimensional feature space and 6% higher accuracy compared with a high-dimensional raw-feature space. Moreover, the drive topics achieved performance almost equivalent performance texpressway datao human annotators, especially in classifying traffic jams and the number of lanes."
1178857,22736,23735,Pairwise LIDAR calibration using multi-type 3D geometric features in natural scene,2013,"It has become a well-known technology that 3D measurement of a large environment could be achieved by using a number of 2D LIDARs on a mobile platform. In such a system, calibration is essential for making collaborative use of different LIDAR data, while existing methods usually require modifications to the environments, such as putting calibration targets, or rely on special facilities, which is labor intensive and put many restrictions to potential applications. This research aims at developing a calibration method for multiple 2D LIDAR sensing systems, which could be conducted in a general outdoor environment using the features of a nature scene. Special focus is cast on solving the noisy sensing in a complex environment and the occlusions caused by largely different sensor viewpoints. A multi-type geometric feature based calibration algorithm is proposed, which extracts the features such as points, lines, planes and quadrics from the 3D points of each LIDAR sensing. Transformation parameters from each sensor to the frame on a moving platform is estimated by matching the multi-type features. Experiments are conducted using the data sets of an intelligent vehicle platform (POSS-V) through a driving in the campus of Peking University. Results of calibrating two LIDAR sensors with largely different viewpoints are presented, and the accuracy and robustness concerning noisy feature extractions are examined intensively."
2902929,22736,23735,Characterization and validation of a novel robotic system for fluid-mediated programmable stochastic self-assembly,2016,"Several self-assembly systems have been developed in recent years, where depending on the capabilities of the building blocks and the controlability of the environment, the assembly process is guided typically through either a fully centralized or a fully distributed control approach. In this work, we present a novel experimental system for studying the range of fully centralized to fully distributed control strategies. The system is built around the floating 3-cm-sized Lily robots, and comprises a water-filled tank with peripheral pumps, an overhead camera, an overhead projector, and a workstation capable of controlling the fluidic flow field, setting the ambient luminosity, communicating with the robots over radio, and visually tracking their trajectories. We carry out several experiments to characterize the system and validate its capabilities. First, a statistical analysis is conducted to show that the system is governed by reaction diffusion dynamics, and validate the applicability of the standard chemical kinetics modeling. Additionally, the natural tendency of the system for structure formation subject to different flow fields is investigated and corresponding implications on guiding the self-assembly process are discussed. Finally, two control approaches are studied: 1) a fully distributed control approach and 2) a distributed approach with additional central supervision exhibiting an improved performance. The formation time statistics are compared and a discussion on the generalization of the method is provided."
591634,22736,23735,A chemo-pneumatic drive source for flexible operation of pneumatic muscle actuators,1994,"Hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical systems form the principle power sources that have been used to operate robots in industrial environments. However, when considering the needs of advanced robotics, one of the most fundamental requirements and problems is the provision of a suitable energy source to power the robot in a nonindustrial, often remote site. This work is aimed at designing a portable power supply that will operate efficiently and effectively in an untethered environment using a chemical fuel. Initially a feasibility study was undertaken to identify the different energy sources that are most widely used in the field of industrial robots, noting their relative advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, the report focuses on the design, implementation and testing of an internal combustion based system that will be used to provide the drive source to a compressor which in turn will produce a constant air supply via a clutch and a series of gear mechanisms. Development and application of the mobile power supply is detailed. The silencing of the system is also analysed to reduce the noise level and allow operation in an enclosed/restricted environment as well as in the open atmosphere. This chemo-pneumatic power source is subsequently shown in operation driving pneumatic muscle actuators used in the construction of a high power/weight dexterous (3 finger 1 thumb) hand. >"
1687459,22736,23735,Human Machine Cooperative Tele-Drive by Path Compensation for Long Range Traversability,2006,"In operation environment with communication time delay, it's difficult to compose a closed loop control structure between a master and a slave system, and some scheme to achieve the stability is thus necessary. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate our proposed human machine cooperative tele-drive system that consists of global and local path-planning, for long range traversability. The operator can command any desired path as a sequence of waypoints by using a 3D terrain model measured as DEM by the on-board sensor of a rover. The data is transmitted to the ground and evaluated to obtain a dangerousness map. To cope with an unknown obstacle, a conventional autonomous path-planning algorithm is applied between each waypoint. In addition, a rover is continuously updating its knowledge about the environment. By continuously recalculating the difference between the original terrain data used for initial path generation on the ground and the most recent data acquired by the rover, a waypoint compensation can be achieved. Therefore, we have to compensate waypoints by using the latest measurement data which can be assumed more reliable than previous data, for corresponding to the difference automatically. Here, the difference is assumed as the distortion between each data set, and compensated by using a distortion compensation matrix which is the mapping between the old and new terrain data sets. Simulation and experimental results and its evaluations by using the rover test-bed are mentioned in the paper."
1617642,22736,23735,Front and rear vehicle detection and tracking in the day and night times using vision and sonar sensor fusion,2005,"Active research into vehicle detection and tracking using a vision sensor are done for driver assistance systems (DAS) - collision warning and avoidance, vision enhancement, etc. The vehicle detection and tracking algorithm for DAS requires a robust feature extraction and tracking method regardless of the light and road conditions and an exact estimation of vehicle position and velocity regardless of the distance from the ego-vehicle. But most research was carried out in the day time with good lighting conditions and the little research done so far in the night time assumed no interference of headlights from other vehicles. This paper proposes a new robust vehicle detection and tracking method regardless of the light and road conditions at any distance using vision and sonar sensors. We use the sonar sensor for detection and distance estimation within 10 m and the image sensor over 10 m. First, this paper proposes a simple method that can determine the light condition by observing several images and this light condition is used by selecting one of several detection methods. The proposed vehicle detection method in the day time image can extract the shadow region represented by the boundary between a vehicle and the road and further verify using other vehicle features, such as symmetry rate, vertical edge, and lane information. The vehicle tracking method in the day time uses online template matching using the mean image created by several consecutive detection results. The vehicle detection method in the night time extracts bright regions caused by the headlights, taillights, brake lights, etc. and these candidates are verified by observing several consecutive frames."
1886441,22736,23735,Predictive compliance for interaction control of robot manipulators,2011,"This paper presents the use of context-based predictions for the selection and on-line modification of the compliance of a robot manipulator. The work is partially inspired on current neuroscience hypotheses about the control of the human arm and the computational processes used by the brain. A first experiment uses inspiration from the classical neuroscience experiment of the Waiter Task. In the original experiment, the non-dominant human arm is holding a weight of 1 Kg. When this weight is unloaded by a self-generated action (with the dominant arm), it is observed that the non-dominant arm does not suffer perceptible postural changes. The reason arguably stems from the prediction of the forces occurring at the unloading, since the inherently delayed sensory feedback present in biological systems would not suffice to react in such a short notice as observed. The experiment is reproduced in a robotic platform by means of forward models and compliance adaption via stiffness control as speculated in neuroscience hypotheses. A second experiment uses context-based predictions to modify on-line the compliance of the robot manipulator. For this task, a Bayesian predictor in the form of a Relevance Vector Machine combines the use of prior knowledge and expected sensory feedback to correct for an erroneous compliance in the case of a falsely-predicted context. The results are combined in an architecture called Predictive Context-Based Adaptive Compliance (PCAC)."
1858026,22736,23735,A distributed knowledge network for real world robot applications,2004,"We propose a collaborative knowledge network that we call omniscient spaces in the attempt to generate sophisticated robotic behavior with minimal programming effort. New products are manufactured and brought into our daily life everyday. Robots should need a way to easily integrate new products into their existing recognizable environments. Radio frequency identification gains increasing attention to support context and ambient awareness in dynamically changing environments. To solve robot programming difficulties in our environments, the collaborative knowledge network connects heterogeneous knowledge resources to collectively build up the robot's knowledge required to accomplish a task. Specifically, a decentralized knowledge acquisition and task specific integration model is proposed, where the proposed knowledge integrator merges specific knowledge with existing knowledge into a task requiring knowledge. For this, manufacturers put their product data tailored to plan robot motions online and robots may access the data without authorization. In this work, the best possible scenario under current technological limitations is proposed for real world robot applications. A detailed analysis of the knowledge flow model is described. To verify the validity of the proposed model, a test bed is built and table clearing task is performed according to the distributed knowledge management framework."
1973569,22736,23735,Experimental slip estimation for exact kinematics modeling and control of a Tracked Mobile Robot,2008,"Tracked mobile robots (TMRs) can be considered as the most important type of mobile robots. Large contact area of tracks with the ground provides superior advantages for TMRs such as better mobility in unstructured environments, though it may cause a higher risk of slippage. In this paper, an experimental slip model is proposed for exact kinematics modeling, and the parameters of this model will be determined based on experimental analysis of ResQuake. This is a tele-operative rescue mobile robot with great capabilities in climbing obstacles in destructed areas, and its performance was demonstrated in Rescue robot league of RoboCup 2005 in Osaka (Japan), achieving the 2 nd  best design award, and RoboCup 2006 in Bremen (Germany) achieving the best operator interface award. Therefore, ResQuake is used here as an experimental platform to study the relationship between slippage of tracks and two main physically meaningful factors, i.e. radius of the tracking path and speed of the robot. The slip coefficients will be obtained as an exponential function of radius of curvature of the path. To validate the obtained results, the proposed model will be used along with two path tracking controllers, and it is empirically demonstrated that the developed model drastically improves the system performance in terms of lower path tracking errors."
873679,22736,23735,Snake robot shape sensing using micro-inertial sensors,2013,"Real-time shape sensing and state acquisition is important for closed-loop control of hyper-redundant snake robots in minimally invasive surgery. Due to the miniaturized size of such minimally invasive surgery robots, it is not feasible to use existing angular sensors involving rotary encoders. With recent advances of the MEMS technology, micro inertial sensors have shown their potential for robot state estimation. Previous studies have demonstrated that accurate joint angles can be estimated for one degree-of-freedom (DoF) joints. However, higher DoF joints of the robot can impose a number of challenges to the current joint angle estimation methods. This paper presents a micro-sensing platform and shape reconstruction algorithm for minimally invasive surgery snake robot with two DoF joints. The method incorporates both gravitational and gyroscopic sensing for calculating the rotation difference between any consecutive robot segments. The gyroscope measurements are first used as the input to predict the rotation difference by direct orientation integration. The orientation difference is then derived from the consecutive acceleration vectors to update the prediction through a complementary filter. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach, a robot prototype with two universal joints was fabricated. Detailed experimental results have demonstrated that high accuracy can be achieved by using the proposed method for joint angle estimation."
2222970,22736,23735,Development of a micromanipulation mystem with force sensing,2007,"This article provides in-depth knowledge about our undergoing effort to develop an open architecture micromanipulation system with force sensing capabilities. The major requirement to perform any micromanipulation task effectively is to ensure the controlled motion of actuators within nanometer accuracy with low overshoot even under the influence of disturbances. Moreover, to achieve high dexterity in manipulation, control of the interaction forces is required. In micromanipulation, control of interaction forces necessitates force sensing in milli-Newton range with nano-Newton resolution . In this paper, we present a position controller based on a discrete time sliding mode control architecture along with a disturbance observer. Experimental verifications for this controller are demonstrated for 100, 50 and 10 nanometer step inputs applied to PZT stages. Our results indicate that position tracking accuracies up to 10 nanometers, without any overshoot and low steady state error are achievable. Furthermore, the paper includes experimental verification of force sensing within nano-Newton resolution using a piezoresistive cantilever end- effector. Experimental results are compared to the theoretical estimates of the change in attractive forces as a function of decreasing distance and of the pull off force between a silicon tip and a glass surface, respectively. Good agreement among the experimental data and the theoretical estimates has been demonstrated."
1358453,22736,23735,IQ-ASyMTRe: Synthesizing coalition formation and execution for tightly-coupled multirobot tasks,2010,"This paper presents the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture, which is aimed to address both coalition formation and execution for tightly-coupled multirobot tasks in a single framework. Many task allocation algorithms have been previously proposed without explicitly enabling the sharing of robot capabilities. Inspired by information invariant theory, ASyMTRe was introduced which enables the sharing of sensory and computational capabilities by allowing information to flow among different robots via communication. However, ASyMTRe does not provide a solution for how a coalition should satisfy sensor constraints introduced by the sharing of capabilities while executing the assigned task. Furthermore, conversions among different information types1 are hardcoded, which limits the flexibility of ASyMTRe. Moreover, relationships between entities (e.g., robots) and information types are not explicitly captured, which may produce infeasible solutions from the start, as the defined information type may not correspond well to the current environment settings. The new architecture introduces a complete definition of information type to guarantee the feasibility of solutions; it also explicitly models information conversions. Inspired by our previous work, IQ-ASyMTRe uses measures of information quality to guide robot coalitions to satisfy sensor constraints (introduced by capability sharing) while executing tasks, thus providing a complete and general solution. We demonstrate the capability of the approach both in simulation and on physical robots to form and execute coalitions that share sensory information to achieve tightly-coupled tasks."
2401683,22736,23735,Shape-based depth image to 3D model matching and classification with inter-view similarity,2011,"Object recognition and especially object class recognition is and will be a key capability in home robotics when robots have to tackle manipulation tasks and grasp new objects or just have to search for objects. The goal is to have a robot classify 'never before seen objects' at first occurrence in a single view in a fast and robust manner. The classification task can be seen as a matching problem, finding the most appropriate 3D model and view with respect to a given depth image. We introduce a single-view shape model based classification approach using RGB-D sensors and a novel matching procedure for depth image to 3D model matching leading inherently to object classification. Utilizing the inter-view similarity of the 3D models for enhanced matching, the average precision of our descriptors is increased of up to 15% resulting in high classification accuracy. The presented adaptation of 3D shape descriptors to 2.5D data enables us to calculate the features in real time, directly from the 3D points of the sensor, without any calculation of normals or generating a mesh from it which is typical of state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-automatic, user-centric approach to utilize the Internet for acquiring the required training data in the form of 3D models which significantly reduces the time for teaching new categories."
1849486,22736,23735,Learning grasp affordances with variable centroid offsets,2009,"When grasping an object, a robot must identify the available forms of interaction with that object. Each of these forms of interaction, a grasp affordance, describes one canonical option for placing the hand and fingers with respect to the object as an agent prepares to grasp it. The affordance does not represent a single hand posture, but an entire manifold within a space that describes hand position/orientation and finger configuration. Our challenges are 1) how to represent this manifold in as compact a manner as possible, and 2) how to extract these affordance representations given a set of example grasps as demonstrated by a human teacher. In this paper, we approach the problem of representation by capturing all instances of a canonical grasp using a joint probability density function (PDF) in a hand posture space. The PDF captures in an object-centered coordinate frame a combination of hand orientation, grasp centroid position and offset from hand to centroid. The set of canonical grasps is then represented using a mixture distribution model. We address the problem of learning the model parameters from a set of example grasps using a clustering approach based on expectation maximization. Our experiments show that the learned canonical grasps correspond to the functionally different ways that the object may be grasped. In addition, by including the grasp centroid/hand relationship within the learned model, we eliminate this as a hard-coded parameter and the resulting approach is capable of separating different grasp types, even when the different types involve similar hand postures."
1616932,22736,23735,Vehicle-terrain interaction models for analysis and performance evaluation of wheeled rovers,2012,"In this work, a multibody dynamics model of a wheeled mobile robot is developed to characterize the terrain reaction forces in terms of the physical and control parameters of the system. A common strategy for simulating the motion of mobile robots on soft soil is to compute the soil reaction forces using terramechanics models and to solve a forward dynamics problem by considering the soil reactions as a set of forces applied to the system. This intends to provide an accurate computation of the forces involved in the wheel-soil interaction; however, a series of factors such as the sensitivity of reaction forces to soil parameters limits the applicability of the existing terramechanics models in unstructured environments. We propose an alternative approach which does not rely on the soil properties, but at the same time does not intend to provide an exact computation of wheel-soil interaction forces. The main objective of this approach is to estimate the effect of changes in control and design parameters on the performance of the system, using the information provided by the dynamics model of the vehicle. To this end, the reaction forces for the wheel-terrain interaction in the ideal limit case of pure rolling and no penetration are obtained upon the specification of the motion at the contact points, via kinematic constraints. The validity of the analysis results obtained using the proposed paradigm is verified by simulation runs and experiments. The experimental results suggest that this approach is successful in predicting the variation of a set of important performance indicators in terms of the changes in the parameters of the system."
1432589,22736,23735,Flexible Hermetically-Sealed Mobile Robot for Narrow Spaces Using Hydrostatic Skeleton Driving Mechanism,2006,"Almost all of conventional mobile robots for narrow spaces exploration, e.g. rescue robots, adopt crawler or wheel mechanisms. However, in narrow spaces, such robot is often stuck because the robot body is sandwiched between both sides of a terrain. Especially, with normal crawler or wheel mechanisms, it is impossible to penetrate into narrow spaces lower than the height of the robot. In addition, sealing bushes of drive shaft cause unignorable energy loss because of rotational resistances. In order to solve these problems, this study proposes an innovative flexible robot with new hydrostatic skeleton driving mechanism. The main components of the robot are a hermetically-sealed outer cover with looped structure and flexible crawlers with hydrostatic skeleton named HS crawlers. This new robot provides remarkable advantages in narrow spaces as listed below: i) The robot can change its shape adapting to terrain; ii) All ground contact areas of the robot are driven toward the same direction. Thus, the robot is able to penetrate into narrow spaces changing its shape even if the terrain is rather narrower than the size of the robot. This paper describes the mechanisms of the robot and the detail of the HS crawler. Driving force of the HS crawler is discussed with comparison of simulation and experiment. Performance of first prototype robot is verified by experiments of wireless driving and passing narrow space. The prototype robot could pass through a space of 300 mm height, whereas the ordinary height of the robot is 420 mm"
2936305,22736,23735,Cooperative aerial tele-manipulation with haptic feedback,2016,"In this paper, we propose a bilateral tele-operation scheme for cooperative aerial manipulation in which a human operator drives a team of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aerial vehicles, that grasped an object beforehand, and receives a force feedback depending on the states of the system. For application scenarios in which dexterous manipulation by each robot is not necessary, we propose using a rigid tool attached to the vehicle through a passive spherical joint, equipped with a simple adhesive mechanism at the tool-tip that can stick to the grasped object. Having more than two robots, we use the extra degrees of freedom to find the optimal force allocation in term of minimum power and forces smoothness. The human operator commands a desired trajectory for the robot team through a haptic interface to a pose controller, and the output of the pose controller along with system constraints, e.g., VTOL limited forces and contact maintenance, defines the feasible set of forces. Then, an on-line optimization allocates forces by minimizing a cost function of forces and their variation. Finally, propeller thrusts are computed by a dedicated attitude and thrust controller in a decentralized fashion. Human/Hardware in the loop simulation study shows efficiency of the proposed scheme, and the importance of haptic feedback to achieve a better performance."
2602875,22736,23735,Intuitive teleoperation of active catheters for endovascular surgery,2015,"Advances in miniature surgical instrumentation are key to less invasive and safer medical interventions. In cardiovascular procedures interventionalists turn towards catheter-based interventions, treating patients considered unfit for classical more invasive approaches. Improvements in design and steerability of catheters could further reduce the invasiveness of these interventions. For example, by improving controllability and interaction forces with the vessels, tissue damage could be limited. Through improved steerability and coordinated control, operation times and exposure to radiation might also be reduced. Latter argument formed the original motivation for the development of teleoperated robotic catheters. Despite the large kinematic dissimilarity and thus non-trivial mapping between joystick input and catheter output motion, few investigations have been conducted to find intuitive mappings that allow straightforward catheter steering. This paper presents some recent work in this direction. Three promising mappings are proposed. The mappings were implemented and validated upon a robotic catheter moving inside an artificial aorta model. Experimental results show good steerability of the robotic catheter for all the mappings. Although superiority of one mapping with respect to the others was observed, further investigation and validation is planned. In the future, additional visual cues that increase the situational awareness of the user are expected to further simplify the steering."

We begin with describing and discussing our approach towards the development of a multi-sen,sory closed-loop active robotic exploration system for workspace characterization. The exploration system involves acquisition, processing, and integration of sensory inputs acquired from uision, poin,t laser range, tactile, and force/torque sensors. The exploration process results in building three-dimensional Half-space models of various polyhedral (convex and concave) objects encountered in the workspace.

1740214,22736,23735,Detecting time-related changes in Wireless Sensor Networks using symbol compression and Probabilistic Suffix Trees,2010,"Our research focuses on anomaly detection problems in unknown environments using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). We are interested in detecting two types of abnormal events: sensory level anomalies (e.g., noise in an office without lights on) and time-related anomalies (e.g., freezing temperature in a mid-summer day).We present a novel, distributed, machine learning based anomaly detector that is able to detect time-related changes. It consists of three components. First, a Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network classifier is used to label multi-dimensional sensor data into discrete classes and detect sensory level anomalies. Over time, the labeled classes form a sequence of classes. Next, a symbol compressor is used to extract the semantic meaning of the temporal sequence. Finally, a Variable Memory Markov (VMM) model in the form of a Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST) is used to model and detect time-related anomalies in the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes/models the temporal sensor data using a symbol compressor and PST in a WSN. Our proposed detection algorithm is distributed, “light-weight”, and practical for resource constrained sensor nodes. We verify the proposed approach using a volcano monitoring dataset. Our results show that this approach yields the same performance as the traditional Markov models with much less cost."
2122982,22736,23735,"The cellular force microscope (CFM): A microrobotic system for quantitating the growth mechanics of living, growing plant cells in situ",2011,"As the field of biology becomes a more quantitative and predictive natural science, an increasing need for investigation and quantification of the mechanics of growth at individual cellular levels arises. This paper describes a microrobotic force-feedback based system and its application to the mechanical characterization of living, growing plant cells. The Cellular Force Microscope (CFM) is capable of performing the automated mechanical characterization of living plant cells in situ as these cells proliferate and grow. The microrobotic measurement system employs a single-axis capacitive MEMS microforce sensor capable of resolving forces down to 20 nN (1σ, at 10Hz). A multi-axis positioning system with 5 nm resolution position feedback is integrated into a complete system with a high-resolution optical microscope and a custom user interface for guiding an automated force-based measurement process. The CFM has been applied to characterize the mechanical properties of 20µm wide Lilium pollen tubes while they grow at a rate of about 10 µm/min in growth medium. For the mechanical characterization of pollen tubes, loads up to 400 nN are applied that cause indentations up to 300 nm. The force-deformation data acquired show an increase in the observed stiffness from the tip to the apex demonstrating that CFM is a promising tool for better understanding the changing mechanics of living plant cell growth."
1929224,22736,23735,3D-link dynamics simulator based on N-single particle movement,2004,"The purpose of this paper is to suggest new 3-D N-link system movement simulator. Previous presented method used to Jacobian matrix for connecting between the workspace coordination and the angle state space for representing the whole N-link system. But this system has difficulties for simulating the whole dynamics of the general N-link system from the side of computational cost and the precision of the calculations. The major reasons depend on the fundamental principle of conversion equivalence between the work space coordination x/sup /spl rarr// and the angle state space q/sup /spl rarr//, this principle assure that we can change the work space coordinate into the angle state space coordinate which is convenient for the calculation, but this conversion have singularity that is, there is no inverse matrix of J. In addition, there is accumulation of calculation error when it follows from the link root to link end in the case of calculating the multi-joint link movement dynamics, and the problem of treating the external force into the angular space dynamics. In this study, we consider the N-link system as N-particle movement system. And each of the particles is connected by a kind of spring damper model in imitation of a link. Because of this, our proposed method has no coordinate conversion between workspace and angular space in the dynamics simulation. And by the way of introducing some dynamics restriction, we can construct many of joint features such as fixed joint or single revolute joint, spherical link and so on. And we confirmed the 3D N-link system performance through some dynamics simulation such as walking, this simulator shows good accuracy and computational cost performances comparing previous proposed N-link system simulator."
2102695,22736,23735,Mobile robot broadband sound localisation using a biologically inspired spiking neural network,2008,"A biologically inspired azimuthal broadband sound localisation system is introduced to simulates the functional organisation of the human auditory midbrain up to the inferior colliculus (IC). Supported by recent neurophysiological studies on the role of the IC and superior olivary complex (SOC) in sound processing, our system models two ascending pathways of the auditory midbrain: the ITD (Interaural Time Difference) pathway and ILD (Interaural Level Difference) pathway. In our approach to modelling the ITD pathway, we take account of Yinpsilas finding that only a single delay line exists in the ITD processing from cochlea to SOC for the ipsilateral ear while multiple delay lines exists for the contralateral ear. The ILD pathway is modelled without varied delay lines because of neurophysiological evidence that indicates the delays along that pathway are minimal and constant. First, two-dimensional (2D) tonotopical ITD and ILD spike maps over frequency and ITD/ILD are calculated by a spiking neural network which follows the biological delay structure. Then these maps are weighted considering the advance of ITD in low frequency and ILD in middle and high frequency. Finally, ITD and ILD maps are merged together to find out the best estimation of the sound source. Experimental results involving noise and voice show that our model performs sound localisation that approaches biological performance. Our approach brings not only new insight into the brain mechanism of the auditory system, but also demonstrates a practical application of sound localisation for mobile robots."
2308209,22736,23735,Multi-scale adaptive sampling for mapping forest fires,2008,"Distributed monitoring applications require wireless sensors that are efficiently deployed using robots. This paper proposes to deploy sensor nodes in order to estimate the time-varying spread of wildfires. We propose a distributed multi-scale adaptive sampling strategy based on neural networks, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and greedy heuristics, named ldquoEKF-NN-GASrdquo. This strategy combines measurements arriving at different times from sensors at different scale lengths, such as ground, air-borne or space-borne observation platforms. We use the EKF covariance matrix to derive quantitative information measures for sampling locations most likely to yield optimal information about the sampled field distribution. Furthermore, we reconstruct the spatio-temporal forest fire spread, based on parameterized radial basis functions (RBF) neural networks. To replicate the complexity involved in actual fire-spread we simulate it using discrete event cellular automata acting as our ldquotruth modelrdquo. Finally, we present experimental results with ground vehicles that navigate over a ldquovirtual firerdquo projected on the lab floor from a ceiling-mounted projector to emulate a sampling mission performed by aerial robots."
2963699,22736,23735,"Semi-automatic bird song analysis by spatial-cue-based integration of sound source detection, localization, separation, and identification",2016,"This paper addresses bird song analysis based on semi-automatic annotation. Research in animal behavior, especially with birds, would be aided by automated (or semiautomated) systems that can localize sounds, measure their timing, and identify their source. This is difficult to achieve in real environments where several birds may be singing from different locations and at the same time. Analysis of recordings from the wild has in the past typically required manual annotation. Such annotation is not always accurate or even consistent, as it may vary both within or between observers. Here we propose a system that uses automated methods from robot audition, including sound source detection, localization, separation and identification. In robot audition these technologies have typically been studied separately; combining them often leads to poor performance in real-time application from the wild. We suggest that integration is aided by placing a primary focus on spatial cues, then combining other features within a Bayesian framework. A second problem has been that supervised machine learning methods typically requires a pre-trained model that may require a large training set of annotated labels. We have employed a semi-automatic annotation approach that requires much less pre-annotation. Preliminary experiments with recordings of bird songs from the wild revealed that for identification accuracy our system outperformed a method based on conventional robot audition."
1969958,22736,23735,Port placement and pose selection of the da Vinci surgical system for collision-free intervention based on performance optimization,2007,"For the operation planning of robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery, the most critical issues are the trocar port placement in the patient's body (incision entry port for intervention) and the pose selection of the robot (docking of the robot). These significantly affect the robot's dexterity, manipulability, reachability, and visibility, which are essential to the success of the surgical procedure. Experienced surgeons still have difficulty solving these problems. Because of possible robot part collisions, the optimal placement of ports may differ for robotically assisted procedures in comparison to traditional MIS. This paper proposes the choice of the best port location and determination of the pose of the robot based on optimization equations that are in turn based on certain evaluation criteria. Two performance measures are proposed: the global isotropy index (GII ), which has been developed to optimize the robot's dexterity, and the efficiency index (EI) to maximize the reachability and visibility of the robot. Computerized simulations of the da Vinci surgical system for surgery in synthetic box environments are performed to find out the optimal solutions. A direct way to evaluate the feasibility of the performance measures for collision-free intervention is also illustrated. It is proved that the GII and EI are correlated and complementary. In addition, this study develops a procedure and guidelines that help the performance of an efficient intervention with the use of the da Vinci surgical system."

Against them, the role of bicycle has been reviewed as one of effective solutions. In fact, many types of bicycles have been developed and have been widely used in our daily life. Though commercially available bicycles have various size of frame for user's physical size, and the positions both of a saddle and a handle can be modified, but there is a lack of interests in the importance of bicycle position as a shared awareness. Provision of proper riding posture for riders based on their physical properties would enable to improve the efficiency of cycling exercise, and to prevent some chronic pains occurred in places of body. To establish an optimization method of bicycle position based on individual biomedical information, this study focuses on the importance of bicycle position, especially we address to search a suitable saddle height corresponding to user's physical features and properties. This paper firstly develops an automatic saddle height control system, and secondly supposes an evaluation standard of cycling exercise based on electromyographic signals of rider's leg during cycling exercise, and an optimization method of saddle height by using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Fuzzy Inference. This paper shows firstly the concepts of the evaluation standard we have defined for rider's pedaling performance with some experimental results, and introduces a fuzzy control system for automatic saddle height control."
2564462,22736,23735,A novel MPC approach to optimize force feedback for human-robot shared control,2015,"One of the challenging problems in human-robot shared control is the algorithms for force rendering due to uncertain human behavior. Common adaptive and optimal control techniques may not be readily applied to a number of popular haptic devices, since the required state space models are not available. In addition, the invoked control algorithms should meet the requirements of a human-in-the-loop control problem and be fast enough for such haptic applications. Thus, this paper proposes a novel combination of model predictive control (MPC) and neural networks to overcome the aforementioned problems. First, the robot is modeled by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The model has been trained with a set of data created with reasonably considered all possible robot variations in a virtual environment (VE). Afterwards, an MPC is developed with the aid of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimized force required for a typical task model. Such optimal force calculation with the MPC approach has been carried out for a variety of reference points of a task. Then another MLP network is trained to find the optimal required forces for a reasonably fast and smooth performance. The results show the effectiveness of this approach compared to classical impedance controllers in increasing user performance."

Unfortunately the unstructured nature of many of these environments and complexity of the task make autonomous operation impossible and tele-operation is essential. A variety of tele-operated devices are available to assist the operator, but in general control of the actions is not truly intuitive. Ideally the operator would wish to input body motions (from legs, arm, hand and head) which the robot would duplicate, and receive from the remote sensors, feedback of a quality and form comparable with that normally sensed. This work considers the development and testing of enhanced input, control and feedback (visual audio and tactile) systems for a twin armed mobile robot to be used in tele-presence applications. In particular the authors focus on the performance of the operator in controlled motion and manipulation tasks. These tests involve assessment of the usefulness of tactile, video and audio feedback parameters including: wide/narrow angle field of view, colour/monochrome, stereo/mono vision and audio. The performance is assessed in terms of the ease of training, time to perform simple functions and accuracy of task completion. >"
2560438,22736,23735,Design and analysis of a rotational leg-type miniature robot with an actuated middle joint and a tail (RoMiRAMT),2015,"In this paper, a rotational leg-type miniature robot with an actuated middle joint and tail, called RoMiRAMT, is proposed for stable locomotion and improved climbing ability. The robot has four independently actuated rotational legs, giving it advantages of both wheel-type and leg-type locomotion. The design parameters of the rotational legs were determined by 3D simulation within the properly selected candidates. It also has unique characteristics inspired by biological structures: a spine and a tail. An actuated middle joint allows the frontal body to be lifted or lowered, which was inspired by a spine, to climb higher obstacles. Additionally, a multi-functional two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) tail was added; the tail provides instant deceleration, and minimized the likelihood of flipping, while allowing the robot to climb higher obstacles. A microcontroller was embedded in the robot, along with a micro-camera and an inertia measurement unit (IMU) sensor. By controlling the robot using the yaw angle signal measured by the IMU sensor, straight movement was enhanced. The body size of the RoMiRAMT is 155 × 80 mm without the rotational legs, and the weight is 593 g including batteries. The maximum velocity of the robot was 2.58 m/s (16.65 body lengths per second) and the maximum height of an obstacle that the robot can climb was 95 mm, which all were verified by experiments."

This paper describes a system which combines optical sensing with integrated focal-plane processing capabilities and integrated image post-processing. It is capable of automatic edge tracking and returns lists of connected pixels. I. INTRODUCTION Autonomous robotic applications require the use of reliable sensors since the capability to extract meaningful information from the surrounding environment is paramount to the accomplishment of any task. Among all sensing modalities, computer vision is the one that is most naturally associated with autonomous robotics. This originates from the fact that visual information can provide a very rich semantic description of the world. Vision operates through a process of successive refinements. The illuminance recorded at each component of the retina is processed, and low-level features such as edges and regions are extracted through relatively simple operations. Higher-level percepts such as depth and motion parameters can then be obtained from these low-level features. A very effective approach to the extraction of edges is based on the convolution of circularly symmetric masks with the illuminance image El). Among the available circularly symmetric masks is the well-known Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) expressed as:"
1181707,22736,23735,Development and evaluation of a vision algorithm for 3D reconstruction of novel objects from three camera views,2010,"When planning robotic grasping and manipulation maneuvers, knowledge of the shape and pose of the object of interest is critical information. In order for an autonomous or semi-autonomous system to operate intelligently in an unstructured environment and interact with novel objects, it must have the ability to recover this information at run time, even when no a priori information of the object is available. In this paper, we describe the development and testing of an algorithm that can reconstruct the full 3D geometry of a novel object from just three images. A variant of shape from silhouettes, the algorithm first generates a rough surface approximation in the form of a point cloud. This approximation is then refined by fitting an eleven parameter geometric surface to the points in such a manner that the surface ignores noise and perspective projection shadows. We test the algorithm in both simulation and on several real world objects. We show that the algorithm provides accurate reconstructions that can be directly used to plan grasping maneuvers. Compared to other attempts in the literature, the proposed algorithm is faster, requires fewer images, is more accurate, and degrades gracefully in the presence of bad data. A real world test case is included that shows that the algorithm still yields usable results when the form of the object is amorphous or otherwise non-geometric."
1522141,22736,23735,A step toward GPS/INS personal navigation systems: real-time assessment of gait by foot inertial sensing,2005,"In this paper, we develop a system for which applications in the field of personal navigation are planned. In the current version, the system embodies a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), composed of two dual-axis accelerometers and one single-axis gyro. The IMU is positioned at a subject's foot instep, and it is intended to produce estimates of some gait parameters, including stride length, stride time, and walking speed. Data from GPS and IMU are managed by a DSP-based control box. The computations performed by the DSP processor allow to detect subsequent foot contacts by a threshold-based method applied to gyro signal, and to reconstruct the trajectory of the foot instep by numerical strapdown integration. Features of human walking dynamics are incorporated in the algorithm to enhance the estimation accuracy against errors due to sensor noise and integration drift. All computations are performed by the DSP processor in real-time conditions. The foot sensor performance is assessed during outdoor level walking trials. The traveled distance estimated by inertial dead-reckoning is compared with the estimate produced by GPS in experimental conditions where GPS can be used as a reference source for accurate absolute positioning. Results show the remarkable accuracy achieved by foot inertial sensing."

A key to successful remote control is to provide onshore operators with a sufficient overview of the processes offshore. To this end, robot manipulators constitute flexible camera platforms, compared to e.g. simple pan-tilt units, for monitoring offshore operations. In this paper, we present a system solution and experimental results for real-time active camera control with obstacle avoidance for industrial manipulators based on weighted pseudoinverse redundancy resolution method. We extend the pseudoinverse solution for joint limit avoidance in combination with obstacle avoidance such that joint limits are gracefully avoided. A novel choice of stereographic projection provides robustness with respect to global stability and singularities. Implementation issues are addressed and the monitoring approach is experimentally validated on two Kuka KR-16 robot manipulators. Experimental results show that a follower robot with a camera is able to monitor and track a leader robot while simultaneously avoiding collisions. In addition, a robot control system architecture which ensures efficient and safe testing of new Matlab-implemented robot controllers is presented."
1845917,22736,23735,An IEEE-1394 Based Real-time Robot Control System for Efficient Controlling of Humanoids,2006,"Modern sophisticated robots, e.g. humanoids, require significant real-time communication speed in their fieldbuses. Several existing field-bus technologies, like controller area network (CAN), Profibus etc., provide real-time performance and reliability, however the bandwidth is not enough to support the communication demand of the complex humanoids. In this research, we have addressed this critical issue by utilizing comparatively faster IEEE 1394 serial bus on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and Linux-based real-time software platforms. Since the lack of user-level communication protocols in IEEE 1394 standard is a major obstacle for designing a IEEE 1394 based control system, we have solved this issue by customizing the predefined IEEE 1394 packet formats. Moreover, various IEEE 1394 serial bus related features have been investigated for designing an efficient humanoid control system. In this work, we have followed the real-time modeling and analysis method using Unified Modeling Language (UML). A use case driven analysis of timing requirement and determination of real-time constrain have been shown to prove the usefulness of our approach. The ongoing implementation of this proposed system in our network based humanoid, MAHRU, has been demonstrated in both commercial RTOS RTLinux (Pro) and free OSS RTOS Xenomai. The performance measurement of basic IEEE 1394 read transaction has been shown in both platforms along with a comparison with similar experiment on CAN bus. This provides an estimation of performance improvement of a humanoid control system on IEEE 1394 serial bus over CAN bus. Moreover the results obtained from two different Linux-based RTOS platforms indicate their relative pros and cons. This also enables us to select the suitable real-time framework for designing an efficient IEEE 1394 based humanoid control system"
2556053,22736,23735,Projected inverse dynamics control and optimal control for robots in contact with the environment: A comparison,2015,"This paper addresses the problem of constrained motion for a manipulator performing a task while in contact with the environment, and investigates two force control frameworks, one based on projected inverse dynamics, and one based on optimal control. Firstly, we propose a control method based on projected inverse dynamics, which directly exploits the contact constraints to minimise the instantaneous joint torques needed to perform a task. Secondly, we propose an optimal control strategy which provides a tool to minimise the joint torques over an interval of time. We show how contact constraints can be used as optimisation constraints in the definition of the problem, and how to formulate the optimal control problem directly using projected dynamics. Initially we explore a positional control problem, where the robot is required to follow a desired path, and show that both of the proposed methods can satisfy the positional task while significantly reducing the joint torques as compared to simple kinematic control and also classical inverse dynamics control. We also show that the proposed optimal control method outperforms the pure projected inverse dynamics method in terms of minimising the required joint torques. We then show how each method can be extended to follow a desired path while also exerting a desired contact force. Again, the method incorporating optimal control is shown to satisfy the task requirements with significantly smaller commanded torques than the pure projected inverse dynamics method. To confirm the analysis, and demonstrate proof of concept, we present the results of empirical experiments with a simulated 3-degree-of-freedom planar manipulator which is constrained to move while in contact with a rigid surface."
2467791,22736,23735,In-vivo pan/tilt endoscope with integrated light source,2007,"Endoscopic imaging is still dominated by the paradigm of pushing long sticks into small openings. This approach has a number of limitations for minimal access surgery, such as narrow angle imaging, limited workspace, counter-intuitive motions and additional incisions for the endoscpic instruments. Our intent is to go beyond this paradigm, and remotize sensors and effectors directly into the body cavity. To this end, we have developed a prototype of a novel insertable pan/tilt endoscopic camera with an integrated light source. The package has a size of 110 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter and can be inserted into the abdomen through a standard trocar and then anchored onto the abdominal wall, leaving the incision port open for access. The camera package contains three parts: an imaging module, an illumination module, and a pan/tilt motion platform. The imaging module includes a lens and CCD imaging sensor. The illumination module attaches to the imaging module and has an array of LED light sources. The pan/tilt platform provides the imaging module with pan of 120 degrees and tilt motion of 90 degrees using small servo motors. A fixing mechanism is designed to hold the device in the cavity. A standard joy stick can be used to control the motion of the camera in a natural way. The design allows for multiple camera packages to be inserted through a single incision as well."
2954450,22736,23735,Unified impedance and hybrid force-position controller with kinestatic filtering,2016,"Interaction control is a mature, but still, current area of research in robotics. Various approaches have been developed for passive and active force regulation and tracking, e.g. impedance control, direct force and hybrid force-position control. The latter method implements a force feedback outer loop on top of a position controller inner loop, where commands are issued with respect to a compliant frame. However, if the compliant frame undergoes a rigid transformation, e.g. in order to specify the same task relative to another reference frame, then commands can be rendered non-compliant with the task at hand. As a consequence, the robot can be damaged or hurt somebody, this is further aggravated by the rigidness of a position controller. In the present paper, we propose a unified impedance and hybrid force-position control scheme to address such issues. The unified controller benefits from the impedance control compliance while an explicit force value can be achieved. Furthermore, we augment the designed controller with a kinestatic filter, which ensures that the commanded pose and wrench are consistent with a given task model. We validate the designed system through experiments with a lightweight robot (LWR). The proposed approach finds applications in industrial settings where interactions with the environment are required in order to fulfill a task and the system must be robust w.r.t. input commands."
922374,22736,23735,Stable haptic feedback based on a dynamic vision sensor for microrobotics,2012,"This work presents a stable vision based haptic feedback for micromanipulation using both an asynchronous Address Event Representation (AER) silicon retina and a conventional frame-based camera. At this scale, most of the grippers used to manipulate objects lack of force sensing. High frequency vision detection thus provides a sound solution to get information about the position of the object and the tool to provide virtual haptic guides. Artificial retinas present high update rates, which enables to address one of the major challenge of haptic feedback teleoperation systems, namely stability. However static objects are not detected. The haptic feedback is thus based on an asynchronous silicon retina to provide a high update rate of moving objects and a frame-based camera to retrieve the position of the target object. This approach is validated by pick-and-place of microspheres (diameter: around 50 micrometers) using a piezoelectric microgripper. The displacement of the tool, as well as the opening and closing of the gripper are controlled by the haptic device. Haptic virtual guides are transmitted to users to assist them in the different steps of the pick-and-place task: a virtual stiffness ensures the correct alignment of the tool with respect to the object, a repulsive haptic force enables users to monitor the gripping step, and operators are assisted while picking and placing the object."

The very low signal-to-noise ratio and low spatial resolution still limits severely BCIs communication bandwidth. This paper presents the ongoing work toward the development of a BCI system for wheelchair steering. A full system based on a visual P300 oddball paradigm is proposed. The signal processing algorithms are computationally efficient and require a short phase training. Temporal features and EEG channels are selected through a Fisher criteria. For enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio and data dimensionality reduction, a spatial filter named Common Spatial Patterns is applied. This method is widely used for classification of motor imagery events, however it is not very often used for classification of event related potentials such as P300. In this paper we show that Common Spatial Patterns is an effective approach to improve P300 classification rates. In our approach, the input features for classification are the projections of the filtered data instead of the variance of the projections as typically used in motor imagery. Offline classification results, obtained with a Bayesian classifier, are presented showing the effectiveness of the overall methodology."
2381527,22736,23735,Experimental Study on Reaching Movements of Robot Arms with Redundant DOFs Based upon Virtual Spring-Damper Hypothesis,2006,"A simple control method for redundant multi-joint arm was proposed recently by gaining a physical insight into human multi-joint reaching movements in redundancy of DOFs. Differently from the traditional approaches, the method need neither introduce any artificial performance index to resolve kinematics ill-posedness nor calculate the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix of task coordinates with respect to joint coor-dinates. This novel approach is based upon an idea of Virtual spring-damper hypothesis, and the control signal is composed of linear superposition of three terms 1) joint-damping, and 2) virtual damper effects in parallel to 3) virtual spring effects in task space. This paper shows through experiments by using an industrial robot arm (PA-10) with redundant multi-joints that the control signal can generate smooth reaching motions without incurring any annoying self-motion even in the case of industrial robots. It is shown further that virtual damping effects in task space play an important rule in making endpoint trajectories of the robot arm quasi-straight. Consequently, the control signal can easily generate human-like multi-joint movements of robot arms without spending a huge amount of computational cost for motion plannings of not only the endpoint trajectory but also each joint trajectory."

The model we propose, termed as Multi-scale Conditional Transition Map (MCTMap), is an inhomogeneous HMM process that describes transitions of human location state in spatial and temporal space. Unlike existing work, our method is able to capture both local correlations and long-term dependencies on faraway initiating events. This enables the learned model to incorporate more information and to generate an informative representation of human existence probabilities across the grid map and along the temporal axis for intelligent interaction of the robot, such as avoiding or meeting the human. Our model consists of two levels. For each grid cell, we formulate the local dynamics using a variant of the left-to-right HMM, and thus explicitly model the exiting direction from the current cell. The dependency of this process on the entry direction is captured by employing the Input-Output HMM (IOHMM). On the higher level, we introduce the place where the whole trajectory originated into the IOHMM framework forming a hierarchical input structure to capture long-term dependencies. The capabilities of our method are verified by experimental results from 10 hours of data collected in an office corridor environment."
1107820,22736,23735,A vision of the patient room as an architectural-robotic ecosystem,2012,"Healthcare is becoming more digital and technological, but healthcare environments have not yet become embedded with digital technologies to support the most productive (physical) interaction between medical patients, clinical staff and the physical artifacts that surround and envelop them. This shortcoming is an opportunity for the architecture and robotics communities to interface with each other and the everyday users of healthcare environments. Our extended lab focused ten weeks on sketching in hardware a robotic, patient-room ecosystem we call home+ with the help of clinicians at the Roger C. Peace Rehabilitation Hospital of the Greenville Hospital System University Medical Center [GHS]. This early prototyping effort represents our vision for the larger robotic patient room, and identifies opportunities for more focused work on an Assistive Robotic Table (ART)."
2290205,22736,65,A methodological variation for acceptance evaluation of Human-Robot Interaction in public places,2008,"Several variations of methodological approaches are used to study the social acceptance in human-robot interaction. Due to the introduction of robots in the home, working practice and usage typically informing the design of new forms of technology are missing. Studying social acceptance in human-robot interaction thus needs new methodological concepts. We propose a so called breaching experiment with additional ethnographic observation to close this gap. To investigate the methodological concept we have been conducting a field trial on a public place. We gathered feedback using questionnaires, in order to estimate whether this method can be beneficially to evaluate social acceptance. We could show that breaching experiments can be a useful method to investigate social acceptance in the field."
2134597,22736,65,A long-term Human-Robot Proxemic study,2011,"A long-term Human-Robot Proxemic (HRP) study was performed using a newly developed Autonomous Proxemic System (APS) for a robot to measure and control the approach distances to the human participants. The main findings were that most HRP adaptation occurred in the first two interaction sessions, and for the remaining four weeks, approach distance preferences remained relatively steady, apart from some short periods of increased distances for some participants. There were indications that these were associated with episodes where the robot malfunctioned, so this raises the possibility of users trust in the robot affecting HRP distance. The study also found that approach distances for humans approaching the robot and the robot approaching the human were comparable, though there were indications that humans preferred to approach the robot more closely than they allowed the robot to approach them in a physically restricted area. Two participants left the study prematurely, stating they were bored with the repetitive experimental procedures. This highlights issues related to the often incompatible demands of keeping experimental controlled conditions vs. having realistic, engaging and varied HRI trial scenarios."
1280076,22736,65,BReA: Potentials of combining reality and virtual communications using a blended reality agent,2013,"This paper proposes a blended reality agent, called BReA, whose body presents and transfers itself between real and virtual environments. BReA can communicate with people through not only real-world communication but also virtual communication. Recent research studies have shown the merits and demerits of communication with robotic agents under a real-world environment, and on-screen agents in a virtual world. BReA, whose body can be located in both real and virtual worlds, possesses the merits of both robotic and on-screen agents. In addition, the feature through which BReA communicates with people in real and virtual environments allows users to acknowledge real-world objects based on its references from a virtual environment. We conducted a field test in a supermarket to confirm whether customers can engage themselves in communication with BReA. An analysis of the consumer reactions confirmed that customers definitely recognized that the directions of the pointing gestures performed by BReA in a virtual environment were oriented outside of the display. Moreover, we observed some customers approaching closer to BReA as it transferred from a real environment into a virtual world. These results demonstrated that BReA succeeds in immersing customers in its presentation."
1742923,22736,23735,Optimal Guidance by Omnidirectional Passive Mobility Aid System,2006,"This work present a loose guidance method for a passive-type omnidirectional mobility aid device named Omni RT Walker-II, which its motion is performed by shared control of user and controller. Guidance is performed by division of environment to accessible and inaccessible areas and the motion of walker-user system is constrained inside the accessible area called Potential Canal. This paper attempts at providing evidence to the fact that loose guide method is an approach to optimal guidance in the sense that when the control (constrain) of ORTW-II motion is loose, its motion pattern significantly resembles user's unconstrained motion. Healthy user's natural motion is hypothesized to be optimal and is compared with constrained motion pattern of ORTW-II for different settings of the Potential Canal. Experimental results are provided and discussed."
2466825,22736,65,Toward a better understanding of the communication cues involved in a human-robot object transfer,2015,"Handing-over objects to humans (or taking objects from them) is a key capability for a service robot. Humans are efficient and natural while performing this action and the purpose of the studies on this topic is to bring human-robot handovers to an acceptable, efficient and natural level. This paper deals with the cues that allow to make a handover look as natural as possible, and more precisely we focus on where the robot should look while performing it. In this context we propose a user study, involving 33 volunteers, who judged video sequences where they see either a human or a robot giving them an object. They were presented with different sequences where the agents (robot or human) have different gaze behaviours, and were asked to give their feeling about the sequence naturalness. In addition to this subjective measure, the volunteers were equipped with an eye tracker which enabled us to have more accurate objective measures."
1847968,22736,65,Emotional boundaries for choosing modalities according to the intensity of emotion in a linear affect-expression space,2008,"Recently, in the field of HRI, multimodal expression has been an issue. Synchronizing modalities and determining what modality to use are important aspect of multimodal expression. For example, when robots express emotional states, they may use only facial expressions or facial expressions with gestures, neck motions, sounds, etc. In this paper, emotional boundaries are proposed for multimodal expression in a three-dimensional affect space. The simultaneous expression of facial expression and gestures was demonstrated using proposed emotional boundaries on a simulator."
2392967,22736,65,Methodological issues using a comfort level device in human-robot interactions,2005,This paper introduces a handheld comfort level device to measure subjects' comfort levels in human-robot interaction experiments. We discuss methodological issues of using the device in an exploratory HRI study where subjects were asked to use the device to indicate their subjective comfort level throughout the experiment. The recorded comfort data were time stamped for synchronization and analysis purposes in conjunction with the video footage to help identify certain situations in the HRI trials where subjects felt uncomfortable. In order to provide a proof-of-concept for the suitability of the handheld comfort level device for HRI studies we analyzed the data for seven selected subjects. These examples show that our method helped identifying robot behaviors that subjects felt uncomfortable with. We demonstrate that the device revealed certain uncomfortable states that are visually hidden. Limitations of the device and possible implications for future work conclude the paper.
1195522,22736,8806,SoSAA: a framework for integrating components & agents,2009,"Modern computing systems require powerful software frameworks to ease their development and manage their complexity. These issues are addressed within both Component-Based Software Engineering and Agent-Oriented Software Engineering, although few integrated solutions exist. This paper discusses a novel integration strategy, which builds upon both paradigms to address their shortcomings while leveraging their different characteristics to define a complete software framework."
2998106,22736,9475,Derivative-free trajectory optimization with unscented dynamic programming,2016,"Trajectory optimization algorithms are a core technology behind many modern nonlinear control applications. However, with increasing system complexity, the computation of dynamics derivatives during optimization creates a computational bottleneck, particularly in second-order methods. In this paper, we present a modification of the classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithm that eliminates the computation of dynamics derivatives while maintaining similar convergence properties. Rather than relying on naive finite difference calculations, we propose a deterministic sampling scheme inspired by the Unscented Kalman Filter that propagates a quadratic approximation of the cost-to-go function through the nonlinear dynamics at each time step. Our algorithm takes larger steps than Iterative LQR—a DDP variant that approximates the cost-to-go Hessian using only first derivatives—while maintaining the same computational cost. We present results demonstrating its numerical performance in simulated balancing and aerobatic flight experiments."
2323844,22736,65,Incremental reconstruction of texture based on spatial information,2009,"The requirement of effective reconstruction of surface texture has been raised by applications concerning interaction with objects; however, the reconstruction of precise details of texture is seldom discussed. In this paper, an algorithm for incremental reconstruction of the details of periodic textured surface is presented. The concept of polar spectrum is introduced to describe the spatial properties of the surface with respect to the direction of measurement. Based on the relation between spatial frequencies and directions, surface profiles in different directions can be rebuilt from with limited number of scans. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
763187,22736,65,Bionic upper orthotics with integrated EMG sensory,2014,"In this paper a novel design of an actively powered arm orthotics is discussed. A light and effective electromechanical motor gear combination is designed which produces torque directly at the elbow. The modular design of the drive system makes it possible to use it in different applications in the field of orthotics, prosthetics and exoskeletons. The EMG sensors are used to measure the nerve impulses. These impulses are then analyzed to generate the reference torque and position values and send it to the motion control unit. This type of actively powered orthotics is developed as a part of an European research project for patients with apoplectic stroke. However, the same principle can also be used in exoskeleton robots."
1263928,22736,9078,A recurrent neural network approach for 3D vision-based force estimation,2014,"Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery has demonstrated its benefits in comparison with traditional procedures. However, one of the major drawbacks of current robotic system approaches is the lack of force feedback. Apart from space restrictions, the main problems of using force sensors are their high cost and the biocompatibility. In this work a proposal based on Vision Based Force Measurement is presented, in which the deformation mapping of the tissue is obtained using the l2 — Regularized Optimization class, and the force is estimated via a recurrent neural network that has as inputs the kinematic variables and the deformation mapping. Moreover, the capability of RNN for predicting time series is used in order to deal with tool occlusions. The highlights of this proposal, according to the results, are: knowledge of material properties are not necessary, there is no need of adding extra sensors and a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency has been achieved."
1960635,22736,65,Development of soft sensor exterior embedded with multi-axis deformable tactile sensor system,2009,"In some important robotic human daily life support applications, such as housework or nursing care, soft sensor exterior is needed for allowing close contacts against humans or environments. Although there are many studies on tactile sensing elements themselves and some of them realize the mechanical softness of the element, most of their studies just propose their detection theory with their sensor element prototypes and it is difficult to use them for developing soft tactile exterior. Therefore a soft sensor exterior embedded with multi-axis deformation sensor is developed in this paper. The most important feature for this sensor is that it can detect multi-axis deformation, and the sensor element itself has enough softness to deform with the outer exterior. The developed sensor is constructed by molding a soft urethane foam with infrared LEDs and corresponding phototransistors. It detects 3D deformation of the sensor as voltage changes at each phototransistors. Furthermore, a prototype of soft sensor exterior embedded with the developed sensing elements is realized and we confirmed that the 3D deformation, such as stroking, pinching, and pushing, can be detected using the developed sensor exterior prototype."
1180174,22736,65,Adaptive Guidance for the Elderly Based on User Intent and Physical Impairment,2006,"A realtime path modification algorithm based on user walking ability and intent is discussed in this paper. This path planning method is being tested by a passive-type mobility aid device called Omni RT Walker-II (ORTW-II) which its motion is exclusively generated by its user, while its controller constrains undesired motion by control of four servo brakes at each wheel assembly. The Potential Canal is an accessible area of the environment in which user-walker motion is constrained. Fall prevention is the first factor which is considered in realtime modification of the Potential Canal. User intent in modifying the accessible are is being interpreted by a force/moment sensor and is used for realtime modification of the Potential Canal. Experimental results by ORTW-II are provided and discussed."
2082328,22736,9475,Modular design and motion control of reconfigurable robotic fish,2007,"This paper presents a module-based approach to the design of robotic fish. A remotely-controlled, free-swimming robotic fish is constructed with a head module, a pair of pectoral fin modules and two tail modules. Propulsion and maneuvering of the robotic fish can be achieved either by explicit joint angle control of the tail modules or with combined pitching and heaving motion of the pectoral fins. A unified equation that governs the motion of the robotic fish is derived, based on which several typical swimming behaviors are designed. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the swimming performance of the robotic fish."

Control models exploiting tactile sensing are fundamental in social Human-Robot interaction tasks.

2047852,22736,65,A novel variable impedance compact compliant series elastic actuator for human-friendly soft robotics applications,2012,"This paper presents the analysis of electro-mechanical design, materials, dynamics and control of a novel variable impedance compact compliant series elastic actuator (SEA) to improve human-robot interactions in human-friendly soft robotics applications. The design consists of a servomotor, a ball screw, a torsional spring connecting the servomotor and the ball screw via a pair of spur gear, and a set of translational springs connecting the ball screw nut to the output link. The translational springs have low stiffness and these are used to handle low force operations that reduce non-linear friction, output impedance, impact etc. The torsional spring is in the high speed range, has high effective stiffness and it enhances the system bandwidth for large force operations when the translational springs are fully compressed. Design, materials for construction, kinematics and working principle of the actuator are analyzed. Then, dynamics modeling and control on the physical implementation of the actuator for different conditions are analyzed. The conditions are: (i) open loop transfer function with load end fixed, (ii) closed loop transfer function with load end fixed, and (iii) output impedance with load end free for (i) low force, and (ii) high force cases. Then, the advantages of the design over its existing counterparts are discussed and its potential applications are mentioned. This novel SEA overcomes the major limitations of the existing SEAs, and can be used to develop human-friendly soft robots for various applications."
2101249,22736,65,Improvements of the sound perception processing of the anthropomorphic flutist robot (WF-4R) to effectively interact with humans,2005,"The development of the anthropomorphic flutist robot, at Waseda University, has demonstrated how the robot can communicate with humans at emotional level by performing musical scores with expressiveness and by transferring basic skills from robot to beginners. However, the interaction among humans is characterized by a highly interactive process of analyzing and responding to incoming stimuli from the partner. Even that flutist robot has successfully imitated the flute playing quite similar to human performance; the way of processing and analyzing the music as human does still requires further improvements. In this paper, we would describe how we implemented a human like sound processing system to enable robot to interact with humans at the same level of perception. An experimental setup was done to verify the validity of the developed system."
845990,22736,23735,A human adaptive path tracking method for omnidirectional passive walking aid system,2005,"This work presents a new path tracking method for a passive-type omnidirectional walking aid system, called Omni RT Walker-II (ORTW-II). ORTW-II is the second version of a walking aid system with an omnidirectional platform and uses MR brakes for its control. A new interpretation of paths, called potential canal is conducted in this paper in order to realize tracking via merely control of brakes of the passive system. Unlike most tracking methods which attempt to lead an objective system on a desired trajectory, in the new algorithm, a mobile system's motion is constrained in a pathway rather than a single trajectory and motion can be conducted by the user. In systems with direct human interaction similar to walking aid systems, the new method is expected to increase user-dependability of the system's behavior while increasing user's freedom. A collision-free potential canal is maintained using a realtime modification method, based on environmental information. Experimental results are included to evaluate the accuracy and quality of tracking."
