3052207,20178,369,Green Cellular Demand Control with User-in-the-Loop Enabled by Smart Data Pricing Using an Effective Quantum (eBit) Tariff,2016,"Mobile communications demand for data grows almost two-fold every year and cellular capacity cannot catch up with this in every location and at every point in time. Not only will congestion situations appear more frequently and severely, but also every increase of data transmitted and every new infrastructure point rolled out in order to catch up with that demand is going to consume more total power. One approach towards greener communication is to reduce the actual demand. While technical solutions on Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers 1 trough 7 are already being exploited, layer 8, the user, is the original cause of the exploding demand. It is naive to assume that all data is equally important and valuable. User-in-the-loop (UIL) is a paradigm which can exactly hook in at this point, and it suggests to postpone, relocate, abandon or offload less urgent demand by immediate feedback and strong incentives like discounts and penalties in certain situations (in case of congestion). In particular, this means dynamic prices depending on time, location, and congestion (load) status, similar to smart grid for electricity utilities. Accounting and billing with dynamic prices, value-added services, and smart data pricing can be a challenge, and such accounting and billing are utterly incompatible with the flat-rate (all-you-can-consume) concept. However, cellular customers are involuntarily locked into contracts, but it is the current practice in the market, which is not in accordance with the free market spirit. Flat-rate plans are practically dead, but those still luring with this name, while having caps on the maximum allowance, sell fixed-volume packages under a smoother name instead. Ultimately, we need to re-establish usage-based-pricing as a fairer and more favourable way of charging. In this paper we motivate the dynamic pricing of UIL and the upcoming new need for usage-based tariffs. We compare a few status-quo tariff plans with our novel effective quantum (eBit) tariff, which is a usage-based pricing that maps multiple usage dimensions into only one metric, eBits. The eBits will be charged for with one constant unit price dollars/eBit to give the monthly bill. All Quality of Service (QoS)-, application-, and time-dependent dynamic pricing factors are integrated into the effective quantum, so that a user can easily understand his current consumption and the bill upto that point in time. Price differentiation per QoS class is easy with constant scaling factors. %This enables smart data pricing to be easily understood by the consumers. This principle can be extended to any other chargeable metric such as kWh of electricity and m^3 of water. This ultimately enables going greener and training awareness of all consumers."
2847777,20178,369,Synthesis of Radiation Patterns in Arbitrary Geometry Antenna Arrays,2016,"A novel algorithm is presented for determining the complex excitations in antenna arrays that are required to have a standard or a non-standard power pattern and where the individual antennas can have arbitrary locations and arbitrary patterns. The technique is simple and overcomes many of the disadvantages of traditional approaches such as those based on stochastic optimisation or least squares formulations. Our approach is iterative and involves repeatedly finding and reducing the peak pattern error. The method is particularly suited to large arrays with severe requirements such as those involving multiple beams with a mix of wide-angle flat-top and narrow regions, multiple attenuation zones with different specifications as well as shaped transition regions. Examples are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the method."
3007663,20178,369,R-OFDM Transmission Scheme for Visible Light Communication Using RGBA-LED,2016,"White light-emitting diode (LED) consisting of red, green, blue, and amber chips (RGBA-LED) has recently been adopted as transmitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems. This paper proposed a reshaped orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (R- OFDM) scheme for RGBA-LED-based VLC systems. In the R- OFDM, the signal is adjusted by separation and biasing after clipping (BAC) operations for transmitting in RGBA-LED. Then, the biasing factor of BAC is derived according to the color mix ratio (CMR) of RGBA-LED. At the receiver, We develop a direct detection algorithm to recover the original data, and analyze its the theoretical bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, a lower bound of the BER is analyzed under high clipping ratio (CR) by using SNR upper bound. Finally, simulation results confirm our theoretical analysis and verify that R-OFDM outperforms the ACO-OFDM in term of BER."
2875774,20178,369,A Study on Channel Modeling in Tunnel Scenario Based on Propagation-Graph Theory,2016,"A new approach based on conventional propagation graph channel modeling was proposed to haracterize the wireless channel in non-light of sight (NLOS) tunnel scenarios. The scattering points are regarded as several points sets, which are different from the propagation-graph theory, then the transfer probability among sets is introduced to adjust the channel impulse response (CIR) taps. The advantage of the proposed method is that wideband channel coefficients, CIR in delay, antennas' correlation coefficient, angle of arrival (AOA), angle of departure (AOD), channel capacity can be calculated analytically for these environments. The validation of the proposed method is performed by the reasonable distribution of the CIR taps, AOD and AOA. Finally some works are done to investigate the variation of tunnel channel coefficients when tunnel bending angle varies, and channel matrix degradation is adopted to explain it."
3107243,20178,369,Indoor Channel Measurements Using a 28GHz multi-Beam MIMO Prototype,2016,"Millimeter-wave (mmW) wireless is as a promising technology for meeting the Gigabit rate and low latency requirements of emerging fixed and mobile 5G applications. This is enabled by the large (GHz) bandwidths and high-gain beamforming due to high-dimensional antenna arrays possible at mmW frequencies. Initial propagation measurements underscore the highly directional nature of mmW communication, dominated by line-of-sight and single-bounce multipath, making beamforming a critical operational functionality. However, existing channel measurements are limited to mechanically pointed horn antennas and single-beam phased arrays of moderate sizes. On the other hand, multi-beam operation is necessary for spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we introduce a new measurement methodology and initial results based on beamspace MIMO channel modeling and communication. The measurement results are based on a novel beamspace MIMO prototype system that uses a lens array for analog beamforming and enables, for the first time, simultaneous multi- beam channel measurements with a beamwidth of about 4 degrees equivalent to that of a two- dimensional array with 636 critically spaced elements. Initial indoor channel measurements follow Friis formula for pathloss, and illustrate the new beamspace channel measurement and modeling methodology."
3007468,20178,369,Effective Beam Alignment Algorithm for Low Cost Millimeter Wave Communication,2016,"The large unlicensed bandwidths in mmW bands promise to satisfy the need for higher throughput in cellular systems. At these frequency bands, the free space path loss have to be mitigated by utilizing directional antennas. However, RF hardware face more difficulties compared to lower frequency bands due to implementation impairments and costs. Thus antenna arrays with one RF chain and limited beam-steering capabilities are commonly used in reality, limiting the degree of freedom for beam-alignment algorithms.Scalable beamwidth in order to use IEEE 802.11ad algorithms is not realizable in some hardware setups. Therefore, a beam searching algorithm with non-scalable beamwidth is presented. To the best of the author's knowledge, existing algorithm rarely consider these restrictions except the well-known exhaustive beam searching. This paper proposes a novel approach, which can reduce the amount of required iterations for the beam searching procedure significantly compared to exhaustive search."
2927116,20178,369,Coverage and Capacity Analysis of LTE-M and NB-IoT in a Rural Area,2016,"The 3GPP has introduced the LTE-M and NB-IoT User Equipment categories and made amendments to LTE release 13 to support the cellular Internet of Things. The contribution of this paper is to analyze the coverage probability, the number of supported devices, and the device battery life in networks equipped with either of the newly standardized technologies. The study is made for a site specific network deployment of a Danish operator, and the simulation is calibrated using drive test measurements. The results show that LTE-M can provide coverage for 99.9 % of outdoor and indoor devices, if the latter is experiencing 10 dB additional loss. However, for deep indoor users NB-IoT is required and provides coverage for about 95 % of the users. The cost is support for more than 10 times fewer devices and a 2-6 times higher device power consumption. Thus both LTE-M and NB- IoT provide extended support for the cellular Internet of Things, but with different trade- offs."
3040736,20178,369,Resource Scheduling for Content Downloading Network with D2D Support,2016,"We consider the muti-user muti-content downloading service with the help of idle users working as contents servers in device-to-device (D2D) underlay network. Taking the contents distribution into account, we propose a hybrid transmitting strategy and investigate the performance enhancement it brings about. Then by formulating the helper finding and resource allocation as a minimum downloading time problem, we propose a low complexity scheme to determine: (1) the idle user which should serve as helper for each downloader through D2D underlay communication (2) the cellular user which shares the uplink resource with less interference. Numerical simulations show that the strategy of taking contents distribution into account can bring significant performance gain. And our proposed scheme is presented to have near optimal performance, especially works well when the contents reuse rate is high."
3020915,20178,369,Performance Evaluation of NB-IoT Coverage,2016,"Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new radio access technology, recently standardized in 3GPP to enable support for IoT devices. NB-IoT offers a range of flexible deployment options and provides improved coverage and support for a massive number of devices within a cell. In this paper, we provide a detailed evaluation of the coverage performance of NBIoT and show that it achieves a coverage enhancement of up to 20 dB when compared with existing LTE technology."
3041008,20178,369,Propagation Characteristics of Suburban Environments Using Hybrid Ray-Tracing Simulation,2016,"In this paper, we analyze a 28 GHz suburban channel using a hybrid ray-tracing simulation. Hybrid ray-tracing technique is a combination of image method and shooting-and-bouncing rays (SBR) method. The SBR method finds a rough propagation path and the image method predicts the exact propagation path. The hybrid ray-tracing simulation is compared with a measurement campaign conducted in Wolpyeong-dong, Daejeon, Korea, and its performance is verified. The transmitter is placed on a 29m building; the heights of the other buildings are between 10m and 12m. Based on a reasonable agreement between the results of ray-tracing and the measurement results, five streets of Wolpyeong-dong were analyzed using ray-tracing simulation. The path loss, power delay profile, root mean square delay spread, angle of arrival and angular spread were obtained."
3031064,20178,369,Dynamic Multi-SIM Gap Creating Procedure,2016,"User Equipments (UEs) supporting insertion of Multiple Subscriber identity Modules (Multi-SIM) have been becoming increasingly popular within the last half decade. End-user requires low cost, which is achieved by implementing a minimum of extra hardware resources compared to a single Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) UE. This sparse amount of extra hardware give rise to access conflicts between the multiple connections and the available hardware, ending up in lost data on at least one of the connections. This paper suggests framework with a dynamic weighting system used to resolve such conflicts, using data characteristics. The goal of the weighting is to handle conflicts optimally; i.e. each connections procedure has minimal impact on the others. We present the framework, as well as the dynamic weighting routine. Throughout the paper we present performance results, showing that the proposed method significantly reduces the latency experienced by the active data connection, when under the influence of Multi-SIM conflicts. The results are obtained using a Long Term Evolution (LTE) downlink simulator combined with a Global System for Mobile (GSM) control channel simulator. Furthermore, we also analyse the impact on the conflicting idle mode SIM."
3048112,20178,369,Diversity Trade-Offs and Joint Coding Schemes for Highly Reliable Wireless Transmissions,2016,"High reliability and low latency are key requirements for a number of upcoming use cases and applications in mobile communication networks. In order to address the requirements, we present statistical models which capture the most important radio propagation phenomena, such as path loss, shadowing, and small scale fading. The models enable the evaluation of trade-offs between reliability, achievable rate, latency, and bandwidth. Additionally, extensions for joint channel coding across multiple frequency layers are presented. Numerical evaluations reveal that the antenna configuration has a significant impact on the reliability performance. Further, considerable performance gains of joint coding across multiple frequency layers are observed."
3000840,20178,369,On the Design of Irregular HetNets with Flow-Level Traffic Dynamics,2016,The application of stochastic geometry theory for the study of cellular networks has gained huge popularity recently. Most existing works however rely on unrealistic assumptions concerning the underlying user traffic model. This paper aims to make a step in this direction by devising a new model for the performance analysis and optimization of heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) with irregular BS deployment and flow- level traffic dynamics. We provide a unified methodology for the evaluation of the flow rate with closed-form expressions of the useful signal power and aggregate network interference over Nakagami-m fading channels. The problem of computing the optimal loading factors which result in the greatest sustainable traffic whilst the system remains stable is formulated and tackled.
2884831,20178,369,Coverage Performance of MIMO-MRC in Heterogeneous Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Perspective,2016,"We study the coverage performance of multi-antenna (MIMO) communications with maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Our main interest in on multi-stream communications when BSs do not have access to channel state information. Adopting stochastic geometry we evaluate the network-wise coverage performance of MIMO-MRC assuming maximum signal- to-interference ratio (SIR) cell association rule. Coverage analysis in MIMO-MRC HetNets is challenging due to inter-stream interference and statistical dependencies among streams' SIR values in each communication link. Using the results of stochastic geometry we then investigate this problem and obtain tractable analytical approximations for the coverage performance. We then show that our results are adequately accurate and easily computable. Our analysis sheds light on the impacts of important system parameters on the coverage performance, and provides quantitative insight on the densification in conjunction with high multiplexing gains in MIMO HetNets. We further observe that increasing multiplexing gain in high- power tier can cost a huge coverage reduction unless it is practiced with densification in femto-cell tier."
3106925,20178,369,Statistical Covariance Based Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems,2016,"Ambient backscatter, a new communication technology, can permit battery-free devices to communicate with other devices through reflecting the ambient radio frequency signals. One challenge for ambient backscatter communication system is to recover the backscattered information bits hidden in the received signals. Existing solutions are mainly based on energy detector and thus provide poor performance at low signal noise ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, a detection algorithm based on statistical covariances is suggested in this paper. Specifically, we calculate the distributions of two covariance-based statistics, design the detection rule, and then derive the closed- form expressions for detection probability and bit error rate (BER). It is found that our proposed algorithm outperforms the energy detector at low SNR regions. Finally, the simulation results are provided to corroborate our theoretical studies."

3048133,20178,369,A Novel Multiuser Detection Algorithm in Uplink UFMC-IDMA Systems with Carrier Frequency Offsets,2016,"In this paper, we investigate the carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) effect on uplink universal filtered multi-carrier-interleave division multiple access (UFMC-IDMA), which has improved robustness against inter-carrier interference (ICI) compared with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-IDMA (OFDM- IDMA). In particular, a multiuser detection algorithm for uplink UFMC-IDMA which is robust against CFOs is proposed. The proposed algorithm takes the CFOs impact into account in the detection process and iteratively mitigates the combined interference from other users and CFOs. In addition, a corresponding approximation method with reduced complexity is also developed, which omits the interference elements whose values are small. Simulation results validate the superior interference cancellation performance of the proposed algorithm and reveal that the performance loss of the low complexity approximation method is small compare with the proposed algorithm with full calculation."

3024083,20178,369,Urban Area Congestion Detection and Propagation Using Histogram Model,2016,"Detecting congestion in urban areas is critical and creates a myriad of complications. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which are trending in recent years, are used by researchers to engage problems related to congestion and transportation. However, due to the open access in urban area structures, it is less feasible to handle rife data that is generated from vehicles and infrastructure. On the grounds, ITS demands a reliable methodology that uses the data's effectively to detect the congestion. In this paper, we present a novel congestion estimation model for urban areas that leads to predict the congestion propagation. It uses a histogram-based model on a window time basis to make the data transfer substantially minimum and keep the system robust. Due to its simplicity, it can be practically implemented in real time for any nature of roadways. Simulation results, with different scenarios, show that the proposed model is detecting the congestion estimation effectively and leads to predict the congestion propagation for the near future."
3030851,20178,369,Adaptive Symbol Request Sharing Scheme for Mobile Cooperative Receivers in OFDM Systems,2016,"In this paper we introduce an improvement of the symbol request sharing (SRS) cooperative scheme, namely the adaptive SRS (A-SRS). Both schemes are designed for systems assuming a source and several receivers with one target receiver among them which is denoted as destination. In addition, the source or the receivers are not restricted to be static. These schemes follow a request-answer strategy, in which the destination requests specific information from the remaining receivers. With this strategy the schemes achieve spatial diversity by performing maximum ratio combining (MRC) on selected subcarriers of a coded OFDM-based system. The A-SRS complements its predecessor by adding to it more sophisticated steps in the algorithm toward its implementation on real systems. With these enhancements, the A-SRS scheme preserves the same performance as SRS for hostile source-receiver channels; nevertheless, it provides a notably enhancement for better channels conditions. In terms of BER, for instance, the A-SRS outperforms the SRS scheme by some dB's of gain and it tends to converge more slowly as the number of receivers increases. Furthermore, the A-SRS scheme adapts the length of the cooperation overhead. Therefore, it reaches the highest throughput, which is not the case for the SRS scheme."
3031024,20178,369,Exploiting Geographical Context in D2D Communications,2016,"In this paper, we present a framework for including geographical context information within the process of relay selection, where both the relay and destination can be user equipment (UE) hence enabling relaying via device-to-device (D2D) communication. Geographical information, acquired through positioning systems and radio maps, are used to infer pathloss, link budgets and relay generated interference. Thus, this information becomes available at the core network without the aid of extra signaling and channel sounding. Tools from image processing can be exploited to analyze the radio map and determine so called isolated regions. Then, these regions are used by the proposed framework to effectively select the relay. Three different relay selection policies that exploit geographical context via the knowledge of the spatial isolated regions are introduced. Each of these policies is analyzed via simulation and performance is compared with respect to baseline schemes. The pertinence of adopting geographical information is confirmed by the gain in terms of useful power and reduced interference level generated."

1871235,20178,369,HSDPA Throughput Optimization with Antenna Tilt and Pilot Power in a Moving Hot-Spot Scenario,2009,"Cellular communication has recently evolved towards data oriented channels with the steady increase of data throughput expected by users. The realization of the mobile internet requires carefully planned networks and continuous optimization of parameters to achieve the highest efficiency. In most cases cell planning is done by considering the worst case scenarios. However there is an opportunity to increase the system capacity by optimizing network parameters such as Antenna tilts and CPICH (Common Pilot Channel) power both remotely and frequently. The moving hotspot model is considered to show the efficiency of the frequent optimization. The effect of different schedulers is also taken into account. It was observed that with adaptive optimization a considerable gain can be achieved in HSDPA throughput. I. INTRODUCTION There have been a lot of recent advances in the field of data communication. Providing high data rates on the air interface is a challenging task. For this specific purpose, new features have been added in 3GPP Release 5 such as the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). In parallel to this, research on adaptation of network elements to match the changes in traffic demand has been a subject of great interest. However, the adaptation is not done frequently, and in most cases is carried out once after the network planning and deployment phases. The field of network optimization consists of two steps. In first step, the main aim is to plan the network and put more emphasis on the position of base stations. In later stages the focus is to tune the network according to different demand and conditions to enhance the system performance. We introduce in this paper global optimization techniques which discuss the network as a whole. A considerable focus is put on not changing the topology of the network but only to remotely modify the parameters using frequent signaling. Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) and Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) are the two factors that have been considered in this paper. Both of them have got the added feasibility of changing them without any additional costs. To simulate the real traffic scenario and observe the gains achieved by the global optimization, the moving hot spot scenario is considered. The complexity of finding an optimal solution is an incremental problem. It increases with the number of users in the network, the size of network, the frequency of adaptation and the number of parameters chosen to adapt. In this paper we investigate the ways how HSDPA throughput can be improved by maximizing the received Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) of the mobile users. This goal translates into maximizing the HSDPA throughput by keeping the HSDPA power under certain constraints. We investigate the ways to find the near optimal combination of parameters in the shortest possible time. We have used heuristic methods to find the optimal solution. These methods do not guarantee optimal solutions but a relatively good estimate can be found in real time for combinatorial problems such as the one at hand, since the antenna tilts and pilot power values take on discrete values and we seek to find the best combinations of both across all network sectors. The antenna tilt directs the beam towards a specific area, minimizing interference to neighboring sectors and offering a higher antenna gain to mobile users of the sector. CPICH power adaptation reduces the inter-cell interference caused by pilot channels, also known as pilot channel pollution. Section II introduces the mobility model, network topology and the schedulers used. Section III discusses the two optimization parameters and the cost function is presented and analyzed together with the constraints. Section IV discusses the need of heuristic algorithms and the algorithms used to solve the problem. Section V presents the results and the advantages that are obtained by doing the adaptation of RET and CPICH. Section VI concludes this paper with a view of implementing the solution in real life scenario and further enhancements that could be done."
2004699,20178,8228,Interference constrained device-to-device communications,2014,"The steep growth in mobile data traffic has gained a lot of attention in recent years. With current infrastructure deployments and radio resources, operators will not be able to cope with the upcoming demands. Consequently, discussions of the next generation of mobile networks, referred to as the fifth generation (5G), have started in both academia and industry. In addition to more capacity, stringent requirements for improving energy efficiency, decreasing delays, and increasing reliability have been envisioned in 5G. Many solutions have been put forward, one of them being device-to-device (D2D) communications where users in close proximity can transmit directly to one another bypassing the base station (BS).In this thesis, we identify trade-offs and challenges of integrating D2D communications into cellular networks and propose potential solutions. To maximize gains from such integration, resource allocation and interference management are key factors. We start by introducing cooperation between D2D and cellular users in order to minimize any interference between the two user types and identifying the scenarios where this cooperation can be beneficial. It is shown that an increase in the number of cellular users within the coverage area and in the size of the cell is associated with a higher probability of cooperation. With this cooperation, we can potentially increase the number of connected devices, reduce the delay, increase the cell sum rate, and offload an overloaded cell.Next, we consider D2D communications underlaying the uplink of cellular networks. In such a scenario, any potential gain from resource sharing (time, frequency, or space) is determined by how the interference is managed. The quality and performance of the interference management techniques depend on the availability of the channel state information (CSI) and the location of nodes as well as the frequency of updates regarding such information. The more information is required, the more signaling is needed, which results in higher power consumption by the users. We investigate the trade-off between the availability of full CSI, which necessitates instantaneous information, and that of limited CSI, which requires infrequent updates. Our results show that with limited CSI, a good performance (in terms of the sum rate of both user types) can be achieved if a small performance loss is tolerated by cellular users. In addition, we propose a novel approach for interference management which only requires the information on the number of D2D users without any knowledge about their CSI. This blind approach can achieve a small outage probability with very low computational complexity when the number of scheduled D2D users is small.We then study the problem of mode selection, i.e., if a user should transmit in the D2D mode or in the conventional cellular mode. We identify the decision criteria for both overlay and underlay scenarios with two different objectives. We find out that the D2D communication is beneficial in macro cells or at cell boundaries. The area in which D2D mode is optimal varies with the objective of the network, transmit power, required quality-of-service, and the number of BS antennas.In the second part of this thesis, we study the effects of integration and coexistence of underlay D2D communications with another promising technology proposed for 5G, namely massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO). Potential benefits of both technologies are known individually, but the possibility of and performance gains from their coexistence are not adequately addressed. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid network in terms of energy efficiency and the average sum rate. Comprehensive analysis reveals that the performance highly depends on the D2D user density. We conclude that underlay D2D communications can only coexist with massive MIMO systems in the regime of low D2D user density. By introducing a high number of D2D users, gains from the massive MIMO technology degrade rapidly, and therefore in this case, the D2D communications should use the overlay approach rather than the underlay, or the network should only allow a subset of D2D transmissions to be active at a time."
2451552,20178,369,A New Framework for Designing Power-Efficient Resource Allocation under Rate Constraints,2009,"In this paper, we discuss resource management in modern wireless communications with the objective of minimizing power consumption, and carry out an analysis of simultaneous transmission and orthogonal transmission schemes in an FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) framework. Based on a two-link line model with path-loss only, the performance of these two schemes for network power minimization under the specified rate constraints is investigated. It is found that ST (Simultaneous Transmission) consumes less power than OT (Orthogonal Transmission) close to the base station, but much more power in the cell-edge area. This illustrates that the ST/OT selection criterion for sum power minimization is location- dependent. Further, numerical results suggest that the ST/OT selection margins are generally dominated by their network rate constraints rather than the rate proportions between the two links. New definitions of power-utility and fairness metrics are further proposed, following by the design of weighted resource allocation approaches based on efficiency-fairness tradeoffs. I. Introduction With the expansion of the global population and the preva- lence of wireless devices, interference among multiple active links is becoming a dominant problem, causing serious QoS degradation for future wireless communications (1). Although various interference mitigation techniques are designed to im- prove QoS, these methods generally require high-complexity transceiver devices. Meanwhile, wireless resources are often wasted during the mutually-interfered transmission processes. Taking these issues into consideration, modern communication industries have shifted their interests to looking for economical system-design strategies rather than simply improving QoS with more advanced radio techniques (2). 'Economical design' takes into account both the network operation requirements and the requirement to minimize en- ergy consumption for environmental reasons, which could be interpreted together with geographic demographics. In high- density city areas, huge energy consumption may reach system energy constraints, causing serious interference and excessive CO2 emissions (3) (4). The energy loss due to enabling and maintaining communications takes a great portion of the total energy consumption compared with the required RF (Radio Frequency) energy. Recently, the concept of 'green radio' is proposed, aiming at the 'economical and environmental design' of wireless communication systems (5). Regarding implementations, intelligent resource allocation and scheduling algorithms are needed under the definition of power-efficiency metrics. Compared with the throughput maximization problem which employs capacity as an effective measure, designing new power-efficient resource allocation strategies is still an open problem. In this paper, several power-efficiency metrics are suggested. One simple form is to minimize the sum power consumption in the network. In this paper, by ignoring the power consumed in transceiver circuits and only considering the RF power components, we investigate FDMA-based ST and OT schemes for sum power minimization under the assumed network architecture and QoS requirements. In order to simplify this problem, firstly a mutually-interfered two-link model is assumed in Section II. After that, the performance of ST and OT with the same QoS requirements is compared and analyzed in Section III and Section IV. A discussion on their properties under sum rate constraints is also provided, resulting in an optimum ST/OT selection criterion for sum power reduction. In Section V, the resource allocation problem is discussed in the broader framework of defining proper tradeoffs and constraints. A new power-utility metric is proposed, indicating the design of weighted resource allocation approaches based on efficiency- fairness tradeoffs."
2359516,20178,369,Analysis on Optimal Configurations of Two-Hop Relay Network,2009,"Fixed relay as a candidate solution in the cellular system attracts more and more attention due to its improvements of coverage and capacity. In this paper, we make our study on the optimal configurations of two-hop relay downlink system. Based on former works (2) (3) (4), two typical resource allocation schemes of the two hops are considered on the assumption of TDD system—one is in time domain and the other is in frequency domain. Based on the improved evaluation model, we demonstrate that it is critical to improve the capacity of the BS to RS link to achieve higher system throughput. Then, different RS positions are discussed in terms of the system throughput and the optimal deployment of Relay Station (RS) is concluded. In addition, we find that the ratio between the transmit power of base station (BS) and that of RS influences the throughput greatly. As is known, mobile communication has developed rapidly in recent years and at the same time the number of users of mobile communication users has increased at high speed. However, as the number of users and traffic increasing strongly, it has been found that the capacity of wireless communication networks has got enormous challenges. The limits of signal propagation, bandwidth, attenuation and noise make traditional communication technology improve hardly. To deal with all these limitations, several new technologies are proposed, among which relay technology attracts more and more attentions, since it is a new technology that is able to increase coverage for high data rates and capacity, while reducing deployment cost (1). As relay technology has so many advantages aforesaid mentioned to cope with shortcomings of conventional cellular networks, the evaluation of system performance is significant for the developing of 3G and B3G. Some work has been done as in (5-7). However, the system models proposed in those contributions can be improved. In (5), single cell BS and multi cell BS are studied, while the co-channel interference is not considered. In (6) (7), similar model is discussed. Four cells constitute a frequency reuse cluster in an FDD mode. The BS is located in the centre of the hexagonal cell. Six relay stations are placed in each cell, each of which is located on the line between the BS and the cell vertices. Such high frequency reuse factor will lead to the decrease of spectrum efficiency. Therefore, we have proposed a multi-cell system evaluation model with fixed relay station, which is more suitable for LTE system and far more reasonable than the models mentioned above. This paper will focus on the effect on the sector throughput by choosing different parameters and resource assignment schemes of relay system. We will demonstrate that to improve sector throughput it is critical to increase the average throughput of the BS to RS link. After that, we shall investigate the optimal position of RS and sector throughput under the two mainstream resource allocation schemes and evaluate which scheme is better. Then the ratio between the transmit power of BS and RS will be changed in order to show how these parameters affect sector throughput. The rest part of this paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a brief introduction of the architecture of the system model including cellular layout, antenna pattern and propagation model. Section III presents the evaluating method of sector throughput from the aspects of time domain and frequency domain resource allocation scheme separately. Corresponding simulation results are given and analyzed in Section IV. Finally, Section V contains the summaries and conclusions."
1905386,20178,369,Lifetime Maximization for Sensor Networks with Hetrogeneous Nodes,2009,"We consider joint optimization problems among link, MAC, and routing layers for wireless sensor networks with hetrogeneous nodes where battery lifetime maximization for a certain portion of nodes is more important than the maximization across all nodes in the network. For such applications, we propose two battery lifetime maximization schemes: a sequential joint link, MAC, and routing optimization, and a receive antenna selection for burst data applications. Numerical results show that proposed schemes greatly increase the battery lifetime for the node group regarded as more critical while the total energy consumption degradation maintains in a reasonable amount. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless sensor network (WSN) has been paid continuous attention due to its wide range of applications such as secu- rity, health, and disaster monitoring applications, etc. Recent advances in hardware technology make it easier to deploy the WSN by allowing more signal processing functionality to be integrated in a single chip. In such sensor networks, sensors are normally powered by small batteries and replacement of those batteries are expensive or nearly impossible in a certain case. Consequently, maximizing battery lifetime of sensors by reducing energy consumption for end-to-end transmissions has become a key design issue for the WSN. For sensor networks, component nodes are mainly designed to cooperate together for the end-to-end transmission. Thus the energy minimization should be jointly performed across all layers of protocol stack since all layers contribute to the energy consumption during the transmission. In (1) and (2), joint optimization between link and MAC layers are considered and optimal time slot lengths are computed based on time- division multiple aceess (TDMA) scheme by minimizing the total energy consumption. In such a cross-layer design, a constellation size or the number of data bits to be transmitted is determined by the link layer optimizations according to chan- nel capacity of physical links. MAC and routing layer compute time slot lengths of the TDMA scheme which minimize the total energy consumption with appropriate constraints such as a flow conservation (3). It is therefore of great benefit to jointly minimize the energy consumption over both date rates among links and link powers which affects the channel capacity. Throughout this paper, a scenario where nodes in the network have different energy property is considered. For this scenario, we classify entire nodes into two groups where one group is more difficult to access than the other. As a system of interest in this paper, we assume some nodes in the network are responsible for collecting information at a remote site where an approach to those nodes for maintenance operations takes a long time and is very expensive. Also some other nodes are responsible for relaying the information to the base station (BS) which can be approached for periodic maintenance purposes even though it is expensive. In such a system, the battery lifetime maximization for the information collecting node is much more important than the lifetime maximization across all nodes in the network. However, it is still required for relay nodes to minimize the energy consumption as much as possible to reduce the maintenance cost provided that the battery lifetime for information collecting nodes is minimal. In this paper, we consider joint optimization problems among link, MAC, and routing layers for the WSN with these hetrogeneous nodes and propose two energy minimiza- tion schemes. First scheme we propose is a successive joint optimization across two groups. In this scheme, the energy consumption of information collecting nodes is minimized over constraints such as the flow conservation (3) and the transmission deadline as a first stage optimization. This stage of the optimization produces modulation orders and time slot lengths among each link involving information collecting nodes. By doing so, as will be shown by simulations, the energy consumption for information collecting nodes can be greatly reduced. However, since the energy minimization for remaining relay nodes is not taken into account, the total energy consumption is much higher than the energy consump- tion optimized over total nodes in the networks. To combat such problem, at the second stage, the energy consumption of relay nodes will be minimized by jointly optimizing across remaining relay nodes and the BS provided that parameters for information collecting nodes optimized at the previous stage are preserved. As a result, the proposed scheme greatly reduces the energy consumption of information collecting node while the increase in the total energy consumption is maintained in a reasonable amount at the same time. The second scheme we propose in this paper employs an antenna selection scheme (4) at relay nodes. In certain applications, relay nodes can be easily treated by maintenance processes such as the battery replacement or location changes,"
1984554,20178,369,Power Allocation and Node Clustering for Distributed Detection in IR-UWB Sensor Networks,2009,"In wireless sensor networks, the limited energy of the nodes should be utilized in such a way that the performance measure of the sensing application is optimized. In this paper, power-aware design of IR-UWB sensor networks for distributed signal detection is discussed. The design approach consists of two parts which aim at minimizing the global probability of detection error. First, an application-specific node clustering algorithm is performed. Based on the generated topology a resource allocation scheme adapted to distributed detection is carried out. It is based on both, information from the network topology and individual sensor detection quality. Numerical results indicate significant performance gains for sensor networks with realistic resource constraints. I. INTRODUCTION The initial task of many applications of wireless sensor networks is the detection of targets in a region of interest. In distributed detection, the sensor nodes process their observa- tions locally and make preliminary decisions about the state of the monitored environment. The local decisions are transmitted to a fusion center where they are combined to obtain a final detection result with high reliability. In practice, the detection performance of wireless sensor networks is influenced by resource constraints like limited available energy or a restricted maximum transmission range. Hence, resource allocation and networking algorithms should be adapted to the detection application (1) in order to optimally design the sensor system. In the parallel fusion network, where all sensor nodes transmit their local decisions directly to a fusion center, the maximum area that can be covered is limited by the maximum transmission range of a node. The covered area can be extended by a clustering of the network into a tree structure resulting in hierarchical transmission of node decisions. This requires algorithms that perform the clustering. In the litera- ture, several algorithms with different optimization objectives and different complexity have been suggested. The authors of (2) consider a TDMA scheme. In (3) two algorithms are presented, which are combined with an impulse radio ultra- wideband (IR-UWB) specific multiple access scheme with non-orthogonal channels. Usually, clustering algorithms are not adapted to specific applications. The asymptotic detection behavior of a tree network for distributed detection has been analyzed in (4). However, for realistic numbers of sensor nodes, these asymptotic results provide only limited informa- tion. In this paper, we present an algorithm which considers the interdependency between energy consumption and the over- all detection performance by including the individual sensor detection performance in the process of cluster head elec- tion and cluster formation. Based on the generated topology, we furthermore suggest an application-specific assignment of transmission power levels that depends both on individual sensor qualities as well as the generated topology. It aims at minimizing the global probability of detection error given a budget of transmission power. As enabling technology for wireless sensor networks, we consider IR-UWB transceivers. Due to the possibility of power control, IR-UWB transceivers are well suited to adapt networking algorithms to specific applications. Compared to our preceding work (5), where the reduction of transmission energy for a given detection performance is analyzed, we ask the complementary ques- tion of how much the probability of detection error can be decreased given a fixed total power budget. Furthermore, we conduct a direct comparison of the detection performance of the parallel and the tree network with and without limitations of the transmission range, which reveals which topology is advantageous in which parameter range. Moreover, a trade- off between the power budget and the number of nodes is discussed."
2003389,20178,369,Radio Parameters Frequent Remote Adaptation: Antenna Tilt and Pilot Power for Dedicated Channels,2009,"Remote Adaptation of network parameters such as antenna tilts and pilot power levels brings important gains to the network performance in terms of capacity. The problem of finding the optimal combination for those parameters across all sectors is represented as an optimization problem and solved with heuristic algorithms. The remote functionality allows a frequent adaptation with no additional costs associated to it. The moving hotspot model is adopted to prove the importance of such a procedure under non-uniformly traffic distribution with dedicated channels in a WCDMA network. I. INTRODUCTION Network elements adaptation has been a topic of increased research for a long time. Traditional research has focused on fixed adaptation, which is carried out once or a few times in the lifetime of a network. We introduce a global optimization approach that considers the network as a whole, where the adaptation is made possible by using frequent remote signaling. As such, we focus on the remote electrical tilt (RET) of antennas (1) and the pilot channel (PCH) (2) power to maximize the capacity of the network. With recent standardization of the RET capability, such a solution is feasible at no additional cost. However, a stable method to enable the optimal configuration of those parameters is needed, with investigation into the complexity. Since such results are not always obvious in a typical simulated network with uniformly distributed mobile stations, we introduce the moving hotspot model to enable realistic traffic conditions. Based on a network topography that incorporates such traffic variations, adapting both parameters mentioned above gives insight into how much capacity gains can be brought to the network without having to increase capital expenditures (Capex) by deploying additional sites, or operational expenditures (Opex) by having work force on-site changing the parameters. The complexity of finding the optimal combination of tilt and pilot power increases based on at least three factors: the size of the network, the number of users and the frequency of adaptation. In fact, since the network is based on WCDMA and dedicated channels, planning and network optimization procedures minimize the interference in the network by transmitting with the minimum required power in uplink and downlink while achieving a required target at the reception. Adaptation of the antenna tilts and the pilot powers is centered on minimizing the transmission power while keeping signal to interference ratios (SIR) at a target level and the blocked users at a minimum. Based on this, we focus on finding a method that finds the best parameter combination in a short time and the closest possible to the optimal solution. Heuristic algorithms are investigated. Such methods do not guarantee optimal convergence, but can run in near real time to find good solutions and have been widely used for solving combinatorial optimizations. Since the antenna tilts and pilot power values are discrete, it is a combinatorial problem to be solved. Section II introduces the mobility model and the network topology. Section III tackles the properties of those two parameters and their adaptation as an optimization problem with the constraints related. Section IV describes the heuristic algorithms used to solve the optimization, and Section V discusses the results and the gains that are obtained. Section VI concludes this paper with an outlook on the feasibility and the applicability to other scenarios."
2503263,20178,369,Multi-User Performance of the Amplify-and-Forward Single-Relay Assisted SC-FDMA Uplink,2009,"This paper characterises two single-relay assisted single- carrier frequency-division multiple-access (SC-FDMA) amplify-and- forward (AF) based cooperative strategies employed for multiuser uplink transmissions over multipath fading channels. For the sake of exploiting the benefits of cooperative diversity, we investigate both single-dedicated- relaying (SDR) as well as single-shared-relaying (SSR), and propose a frequency-domain (FD) subband-based AF scheme combined with subband remapping, which is benchmarked against conventional time- domain (TD) AF in the context of both of the above-mentioned relaying topologies. Our simulation results show that cooperative diversity is beneficial for both SDR and SSR, both in the absence and in the presence of multipath diversity. More importantly, the proposed FD-AF scheme is capable of attaining a multiuser performance, which is better than that of the conventional single-user TD-AF protocol operating in a multipath environment, because of the subband-based AF and noise suppression capability of the relay. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless cooperative communications and relaying have attracted substantial research attention over the past decade as a benefit of their spatial diversity gain attained in a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO) scenario created by the distributed single- antenna terminals by sharing resources with their cooperative part- ners. This cooperation allows the system to mitigate the radio channel's fading by jointly exploiting the benefits of frequency- , time- and spatial-diversity. Furthermore, the cooperative strategy nal subcarrier mapping in order to support multiple users without con- tamination by MUI. Furthermore, our single-relay assisted SC-FDMA system allows user cooperation to achieve a diversity gain without imposing MUI by the cooperating sources and relays upon the UL- receiver at the basestation (BS). It is worth noting that SC-FDMA is capable of exploiting the benefits of multipath diversity for transmis- sion over broadband channels, while in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) (12) each subcarrier experiences a single-path channel, hence no multipath diversity gain is achieved. It has been indicated in (13) that SC-FDMA attains a similar overall performance as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), but it is more suitable for uplink transmission due to its lower peak-to- average power ratio (PAPR), which is typically high in multicarrier systems (12). Additionally, the combination of based modulation with the discrete Fourier transform and inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT/IDFT) SC-FDMA transmitter can be adaptively reconfigured in order to mitigate the effects of time-variant channels. The system is also available to cooperative communications. Hence, our novel contribution is that we achieve cooperative diversity by utilising a sophisticated SC-FDMA scheme, which exploits the benefits of AF based single-relay assisted user cooperation aided UL transmis- sions. Our simulation results show that cooperative diversity may be achieved for both the single-dedicated-relaying (SDR) and single- shared-relaying (SSR) strategies in both single-path and multipath scenarios. As a result, the proposed frequency-domain (FD) subband- based amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme is combined with subband remapping at the relay. By contrast, the system invokes minimum mean-square error (MMSE) assisted FDE for each of the cooperative branches at the BS, where a simple time-domain (TD) equal-gain combiner (EGC) (14) is adopted. The resultant system is capable of achieving a multiuser performance, which is better than that of the conventional single-user TD-AF protocol operating in a multipath environment."
2145299,20178,369,An Affective Intelligent Driving Agent: Driver's Trajectory and Activities Prediction,2009,"The traditional relationship between the car, driver, and city can be described as waypoint navigation with additional traffic and maintenance information. The car can receive and store waypoint information, find the shortest route to these waypoints, integrate traffic information, find points-of-interest, and alert the driver of a pre-programmed set of maintenance issues related to the car. Here, we propose a new route system that is multi-goal-centric rather than waypoint-centric. Instead of focusing on determining the route to a specified waypoint, as done in commercially available navigation systems, the system will analyze the driver's behavior in order to extract the potential set(s) of goals that the driver would like to achieve. The system must also understand the city on a number of levels: physical, social, and commercial. This provides the foundation for a social and intelligent driving assistant, that helps the driver achieve his goals and helps the city perform better through interaction between both entities. I. INTRODUCTION Current navigation systems are focused on finding way- points. They are capable of pointing out the shortest route to a destination, integrating traffic information, and identifying points-of-interest. These systems can successfully assist in driving to a fixed desired destination. However, individuals often make trips with the purpose of achieving various goals, such as purchasing gasoline, watching a movie, or participating in a public event, while the physical location of their destina- tion is flexible. Also, driving conditions in the city change in response to different events, influencing the accessibility levels of areas in the city. We envision a navigation system that mimics the friendly expertise of a driving companion who is familiar with both the driver and the city. Instead of focusing solely on determining routes to a specified waypoint, our system utilizes the analysis of the driver's behavior in order to identify the set of goals the driver would like to achieve. Furthermore, it involves an understanding of the city beyond what can be seen through the windshield, incorporating information such as business and shopping districts, tourist and residential areas, as well as real- time event information and environmental conditions. In recent years, a multitude of tags, sensors, locationing devices, telecommunications networks, online social networks, and other pervasive networks are proliferating in cities. They are constantly producing a rich stream of data that can help describe dynamic rhythms in the city. Our navigation system works to recognize underlying patterns in this data pertaining to various aspects of the city including traffic, seasonal infor- mation, environmental conditions, commercial offerings, and events. In-car sensors provide information about the driver's mood, attention span, as well as about interaction with the car, for example navigation decisions, acceleration and braking, climate control, and seat position. Thus, over time, the car can learn about a driver's habits, routes, and goals, and in the short term, the car can dynamically adjust to the driver's current state. II. RELATED WORK The works related to the research proposed in this paper include: I) Destination and trajectory prediction, II) Semantics analysis of the City and III) Profiling of the City using GPS data."
2322905,20178,369,On Improved DCT Based Channel Estimation with Very Low Complexity for MIMO-OFDM Systems,2009,"Abstract —This paper deals with a novel transform domainchannel estimation (TD-CE) based on discrete cosine transform(DCT) for the MIMO-OFDM system. After the descriptionof the conventional DCT based method, a channel estimationscheme improved in terms of both performance and complexityusing small DCT blocks is proposed. Finally the efﬁciency ofthis estimator is evaluated within IEEE802.11n and 3GPP/LTEsystem contexts. Keywords — MIMO-OFDM, DFT, DCT, channel estimation,”border effect”, 802.11n, 3GPP/LTE. I. I NTRODUCTION Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is anefﬁcient candidate for high data rate wireless communicationsowing to its many advantages, notably its high spectral efﬁ-ciency, mitigation of intersymbol interference (ISI), robustnessto frequency selective fading environment, as well as thefeasibility of low cost transceivers [1].On the other hand the multi-input multi-output (MIMO)system has the potential to obtain a diversity gain and toimprove the system capacity [2], [3], [4]. Hence the combi-nation of MIMO and OFDM technologies (MIMO-OFDM) isnow largely considered in the new generation of standards forwireless transmission [5].In MIMO-OFDM systems, the channel state information(CSI) is usually required at the receiver side and thus sub-channels between each antenna link have to be individually es-timated. Dynamic channel estimation becomes necessary sinceradio channel are frequency selective and time-dependent. Thatis the reason why construction of training sequences has tobe adapted depending on the MIMO conﬁguration and thechannel characteristics [6]. For OFDM channel estimationbased on pilot insertion, different techniques can be applied:preamble method and comb-type pilot method.An efﬁcient way to use preamble symbols is the TD-CEmethod. The DFT based method is considered as one of thepromising methods because it can provide very good resultsby signiﬁcantly reducing the noise on the estimated channelcoefﬁcients [7]. However, ”border effect” may occur whenthe number of IFFT points is different from the number ofmodulated subcarriers [7]. This is a real problem becausethe vast majority of modern multicarrier systems contain nullcarriers at the spectrum extremities.DCT is suggested instead of DFT for mitigating the impactof the ”border effect” owing to its capacity to reduce thehigh frequency components in the transform domain [8] atthe price of a weaker noise reduction [9]. On the top of that,the complexity and latency of the DCT calculation may causeproblems.This paper proposes an improved DCT based channel es-timation with very low complexity. The whole DCT windowwill be divided into small overlapping blocks where the lengthof each block is a power of 2. The complexity is reduced whilethe performance is improved.II. MIMO-OFDM S"
2170259,20178,369,A Single Antenna Interference Cancellation Algorithm for OFDM Communication Systems,2009,"Due to limited frequency resources, the co-channel interference (CCI) from adjacent femto cells operating and co- existing with conventional macro cells in the same frequency channel would greatly degrade the bit error rate (BER) per- formance of mobile terminals. CCI cancellation algorithms for the 2G GSM and the 3G CDMA systems have been under intense research. However, since orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted in the next generation mobile communication systems, dealing with CCI is more com- plex in OFDM than in GSM or CDMA because it requires dynamic power control and frequency allocation with advanced coordination among base stations. In this paper, we propose a single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) algorithm named power adaptive joint maximum a posterior (PA-JMAP) for OFDM systems. The proposed PA-JMAP algorithm jointly decodes the desired and interfering data by using a joint trellis, which defines all possible combinations of each base station's encoder trellis. Signal to interference ratio (SIR) estimated by a sequentially updated estimator is used to track power changes of the received signal. Simulation results show that the proposed PA-JMAP decoder could greatly improve the BER performance for OFDM systems even under severe CCI conditions when compared to a conventional viterbi decoder (CVD). I. INTRODUCTION Due to limited frequency resources, the co-channel inter- ference (CCI) from adjacent interfering femto base stations (BSs) which are operating and co-existing with the desired BS in the same frequency channel would greatly degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance of mobile terminals. This poor channel condition also causes a large number of retransmissions which further lower the throughput. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted in several wireless communication systems to provide high transmission rate, increase frequency efficiency and combat multi-path fading. CCI cancellation algorithms for the 2G GSM and the 3G CDMA systems have been under intense research. However, dealing with CCI is more complex in OFDM than in GSM or CDMA since it usually requires dynamic power control and channel allocation with advanced coordination among BSs. The effects of CCI on multi-carrier communication systems have already been studied in (1) and (2), both of which demonstrate that CCI has a large impact on the BER per- formance and it is needed to be taken into consideration. CCI cancellation algorithms can be divided into two classes. The first class, named multiple antenna interference cancellation (MAIC), usually exploits transmission, receiving or space diversity provided by multiple antennas and additional coding schemes. In contrast, the second class, named single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC), cancels CCI by only one receiving antenna. MAIC is usually effective for CCI cancella- tion in the uplink. However, in the downlink, due to limitations like the power consumption, the processing speed and the battery life at a mobile terminal, SAIC is more effective and suitable for practice. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to cancel CCI caused by adjacent interfering BSs at a mobile terminal through only one receiving antenna. Joint detection (JD) and blind interference cancellation (BIC) are the two most prominent classes of SAIC (3). BIC only decodes the desired data while JD attempts to jointly decode both the desired and interfering data. Since JD exploits the knowledge of the interfering signal, it is usually expected to provide a better performance than BIC but at a cost of high complexity."
2590650,20178,10228,High rate space-time codes for millimeter-wave systems with reconfigurable antennas,2015,"In this paper, we propose a high-rate space-time block code (STBC) for millimeter-wave wireless communica- tion systems that are equipped with reconfigurable multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. We assume that each reconfigurable antenna element has the capability of forming its beam and can independently change the characteristics of its radiation pattern 1 . We exploit this feature of the antenna elements to construct the proposed space-time block code where each coded symbol is sent over independent beams. As a result, the received coded symbols at different receive antennas will have different power levels, a desired property that can be used in data detection. We show that the proposed code achieves a coding rate of two and requires a low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector. We carry out computer simulations that demonstrate the performance of the proposed code and shows its superiority in compared to previous rate-2 STBC counterparts. We also comment on the generalization of the proposed STBC for higher MIMO dimensions. Index Terms—Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), recon- figurable antennas, space-time block coding. From the physical layer perspective, if reconfigurable an- tennas are used in mmWave systems, new signal processing algorithms need to be designed to benefit from the antennas capabilities. Essentially, the previous microwave-band signal processing algorithms which are developed based on the assumption of omni-directional signal propagation and rich scatterer environment may not remain optimal for mmWave systems (12). This can be attributed to the propagation charac- teristics of the signal that are particular to the mmWave band, which are quite different than those encountered in the mi- crowave band (13). At the mmWave frequencies, multipath is insignificant, while attenuation from atmospheric precipitation is more important (14). The space-time block codes (STBCs) is one of the key building blocks of wireless communication systems that their performance will be impacted by signal propagation behavior in mmWave systems. The STBCs have been designed based on the well accepted notion that the transceiver is equipped with omni-directional antennas, while in the mmWave systems, the radiation pattern of the antennas need to be directive to compensate for the large path loss at mmWave frequencies. Therefore, the STBCs designed for conventional MIMO sys- tems ignore the antenna gain and directivity in the mmWave systems. Naturally, a more effective STBC design approach should exploit the directive radiation pattern of the antennas utilized in mmWave systems. In this paper, we propose a high-rate space-time block code for a 2×2 MIMO system equipped with reconfigurable antenna elements. The proposed code uses the properties of the recon- figurable antennas to enhance the coding rate, while reducing the computation complexity of the receiver. In particular, we design a STBC code based on the rotated quasi-orthogonal coding principles (15)-(18). At each time slot, the system transmits multiple rotated symbols each intended for a partic- ular desired direction and receive antenna. The deployment of reconfigurable antennas at the transmitter enables the system to amplify the transmitted signal towards the desired receive antenna, while placing nulls towards the remaining directions (19). By using this mechanism, the system suppresses the interference from the undesired beams at the receiver. This is feasible if the antenna elements at the transmitter and"
1955913,20178,369,Synthesis of Planar Arrays Using Particle Swarms with Selection,2009,"In this work, two well-known classical PSO schemes have been modified by introducing a tournament selection strategy, commonly used in genetic algorithms, and the new hybrid PSO schemes (HPSO) have been applied to planar array synthesis. The classical PSO schemes with either synchronous or asynchronous updates of the swarm and a global topology are considered and appropriately modified by introducing a tournament selection strategy in order to increase search pressure and make the algorithm speed up convergence. Results comparing both classical and HPSO schemes are included and the pros and cons of the hybrid approach proposed are reported and discussed. The synthesis of the complex element weights to best meet certain far-field radiation pattern restrictions given in terms of 3D-masks has been considered as the canonical problem. Furthermore, representative synthesis results for a planar array to be considered as a 120 degrees sectored antenna for local multipoint distribution systems (LMDS) are also included. Modern heuristic optimization methods such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and more recently particle swarm optimization (PSO), have received great attention among the scientific community in many applications and research areas during the last decade, demonstrating throughout the literature its ability to cope with high-dimensional and multimodal optimization problems (1). Among these techniques, the PSO algorithm has gained many practitioners as it turns out to be easier to implement and tune than other population-based methods such as GA, (2-4). The three main advantages of the heuristic PSO algorithm against GA concern the simplicity of implementation, the use of only one operator -the velocity operator- and the smaller number of parameters to be set and tuned. Similar in nature to other stochastic methods, the PSO algorithm emulates computationally the behavior of groups such as bird flocking or fish schooling from the interaction of the individuals among themselves and with the environment (5). Moreover, different classical schemes can be proposed and found in the literature, classified and differentiated depending on how and when the information concerning new promising regions visited by any of the individuals, particles or agents throughout the optimization process, is transmitted to the rest of the swarm, (2, 6). Basically, depending on how the information flows, i.e. the instant the new discoveries or improvements achieved by any particle within the swarm is available for the rest of the population, either synchronous or asynchronous PSO schemes can be considered. Finally, depending on how each particle becomes influenced by the experience acquired by its neighbors, several swarm topologies can be outlined (2, 4, 7), although in this work the global topology is only considered. Similar in some aspects to human cultural behavior, the global topology PSO scheme means that any particle within the swarm directs its search according to the achievements and recent discoveries obtained by any partner within the swarm, even if it points towards deceptive or local solutions. Global topologies are less robust than the local ones, but on the contrary they are slightly faster (2, 4).

1377545,20178,369,Experimental Validation of the OFDM Bit Error Probability for a Moving Receive Antenna,2014,"For an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system with pilot-symbol aided channel estimation, we compare the measured bit error ratio to the theoretical bit error probabil- ity. In order to measure mobile physical systems, we utilize the Vienna Wireless Testbed which has been augmented by a rotation wheel unit. The analytical solution assumes Rayleigh fading, additive Gaussian noise, and an arbitrary linear interpolation method to estimate the unknown channel taps. Our measurements confirm our assumptions and demonstrate convincingly that our theoretical expressions accurately model the true physical behavior, even for speeds of up to 100 km/h. I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, most wireless communication standards (DAB, LTE, WIFI 802.11) employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as their modulation technique. While we have a good knowledge of what to expect in coherent transmissions over wireless channels in idealistic setups, the implications of practical systems are by far not so well understood. In particular high speed scenarios as they appear in car/train to infrastructure communications by LTE require a solid understanding of the transmission chain. Coherent trans- mission requires channel knowledge which typically comes by estimation based on training or so-called pilot symbols, i.e., known symbols at transmitter and receiver side. Pilot-symbol- Aided Channel Estimation (PACE) is usually considered in this context whereby the channel at data positions is estimated by interpolation. The optimal linear interpolation in terms of Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) was derived in (1). However, an MMSE solution requires a-priori knowledge of the channel statistics and a matrix inversion. This motivated other authors to investigate different interpolation methods e.g., spline (2), 2D Deslauriers-Dubuc (3) and 2D low-pass (4). As a comparison measure the Bit Error Ratio (BER) was obtained through Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations require a long simulation time and do not offer analytical insights. This recently motivated us to derive an analytical Bit Error Probability (BEP) expression for arbitrary linear interpolation methods (5) which can, for example, be used to find an improved pilot pattern design or to determine the optimal trade-off between pilot and data symbol power (6). Mobile wireless communication channels are characterized by time-varying multipath propagation (7), i.e., due to multiple scatterers, the electromagnetic signal can propagate along several different paths which causes frequency-selectivity and time-selectivity. The first can be combated by inserting a cyclic prefix while the latter leads to Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI)"
2441091,20178,369,Performance Evaluation of Multi-Radio Transmission Diversity: QoS Support for Delay Sensitive Services,2009,"With the advent of multi-radio access (MRA), an integration of differentradio access technologies (RATs) into a heterogeneous radio access network(RAN) becomes feasible. Such integration allows a user to be at any instantof time served by one or multiple radio accesses (RAs) concurrently, where anRA constitutes an independent radio resource, such as a carrier or a channel,implemented by a single RAT. It also allows a user´s service demands to bemapped onto the aggregated network resources in a transparent and efficientway. An approach for the realization of such multi-radio integrated environmentsis through a unifying generic link layer (GLL) that provides joint radiolink processing and enables communication between nodes and devices acrossdifferent radio accesses.Based on the requirements on multi-access, an architecture that supportsMRA is suggested and the functions of GLL that aims at integrating andutilising multiple RATs are defined. We explore the potential for performanceimprovements through novel extensions of the transmission diversityparadigm which builds on GLL functions that enable multi-radio access selection.Multi-radio transmission diversity (MRTD) is defined as the dynamicselection of radio access for the transmission of a user´s data and it can bethought of as consisting of a packet scheduler operating across multiple radiointerfaces. Different MRTD schemes may be envisaged through combinationsof access re-selection rate, transmission parallelism and transmission redundancy.The re-selection rate refers to the rate at which radio access selectionis performed. It may range from multiple IP packets to one single MACframe. Switched MRTD corresponds to an access selection scheme where auser transmits via one RA at a time, while parallel MRTD corresponds to ascheme where simultaneous transmissions over multiple RAs are scheduled.Finally, redundancy refers to the transmission of copies of the same data overmultiple RAs to increase the possibility of correct reception.The benefits of MRTD are investigated by simulation studies on two multiradiocase scenarios, based on generic RATs and on specific RATs respectively.In the RAT generic scenario, switched MRTD has been evaluated for networktopologies of collocated and non-collocated RAs consisting of macroand pico-cells. In the case of collocated RAs, spectral efficiency is increasedby exploiting diversity in multi-path fading while in non-collocated RAs, thespectral efficiency increase is due to diversity exploitation in both shadowingand multi-path fading. Simulation results show that switched MRTD is mostadvantageous when the RAs provide comparable throughputs. Furthermore,when combined with multi-radio ARQ, MRTD significantly reduces packetloss and packet transmission delays. This is also shown in the specific radioaccesssimulation scenario where a delay sensitive voice service is studied. Inaddition, switched MRTD provides comparable gains to parallel MRTD interms of average packet transmission delay and packet loss, while using lessradio resources. In all cases, it is concluded that maximum performance isconditioned on the reporting delays of the channel quality indicator (CQI).Reporting delays of CQI that are half the channel coherence time render sucha complex MRTD mechanism less effective."
2438104,20178,369,An Improved Scheduling Algorithm for rtPS Services in IEEE 802.16,2009,"The IEEE 802.16e standard provides five different scheduling services to meet the QoS requirement of multimedia applications and this paper investigates one specific scheduling service, i.e. rtPS scheduling. In order to relieve the serious MAC overhead problem in WiMAX system, an efficient scheduling algorithm for the rtPS services has been proposed in this paper. Also the algorithm has been implemented and evaluated in the WiMAX simulation platform developed based on NS-2. From the simulation results, we can see not only the QoS requirement is ensured, but the system performance is also optimized with reduced MAC overhead using the proposed scheduling algorithm. In the last few years, there is a rapid growth of new services, such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video conference, online gaming and peer-to-peer service. Those high data rate, high capacity and more advanced multimedia service has expedited the increasing availability of broadband wireless access. As one of the next-generation broadband wireless access technologies, WiMAX technology, based on the IEEE 802.16 standard ((1) and (2)), has a very rich set of features to support the advanced multimedia services. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme assigns frequency resource adap- tively based on frequency selectivity, and Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) changes Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) level adaptively based on instant channel quality. These schemes lead to increase the efficiency of radio resource utilization and consequently to improve the system capacity. Another important feature of the WiMAX technology is the support for Quality of Service (QoS) at the MAC level and the radio resource scheduling is vital for QoS provision. The IEEE 802.16e standard has defined five scheduling service classes with different QoS requirements, including bandwidth, packet loss, delay and delay jitter: Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), real-time Polling Service (rtPS), extended real-time Polling Service (ertPS), non-real-time Polling Service (nrtPS), and Best-Effort (BE). The 802.16 standard specifies two modes for sharing the wireless medium: Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) and Mesh (optional). Since the PMP mode is currently mandatory for the operator, we focus on the PMP model in this paper. The basic approach for providing the QoS guarantees in the 802.16 PMP network is that the Base Station (BS) does the scheduling for both the uplink and downlink directions and the BS translates the QoS requirements of the Subscriber Stations (SSs) into the appropriate number of radio resource within the 802.16 frame. After the BS makes a scheduling decision, it informs all SSs about the explicit resource allocation in the uplink and downlink directions by using the UL-MAP and DL-MAP messages at the beginning of each frame. However, the concrete algorithms on how to allocate radio resource to satisfy the different QoS requirements are not specified in the IEEE 802.16 standard, but rather are open"
2149934,20178,369,Performance Trade-Off Investigation of B-IFDMA,2009,"A performance trade-off investigation is carried out between different possible uplink multiple access schemes, that are based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), for International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) Advanced systems. Between the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) precoded systems with different subcarrier allocation mappings and systems lacking DFT-precoders, Block Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (B-IFDMA) is shown to provide a good trade-off between the frequency diversity col- lected, envelope properties achieved, and channel estimation performance compared to the other mapping schemes. The schemes are analyzed in the presence of the different possible modules which include equalizers, modulators, interleavers, and channel codes. In particular, robust codes such as Turbo codes are able to collect the diversity provided by such schemes, and B-IFDMA systems is shown to be able to beat the other systems in bit error rate (BER) performance terms. I. INTRODUCTION The wireless communication industry has always been un- der tremendous improvements in the past few decades, but will the needs for improvement reach an end? Not at all! Future wireless systems need to operate in widely different deployment scenarios and carry traffic with widely varying characteristics. As part of the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), IMT-Advanced capable Wireless World Initiative New Radio (WINNER) system concept, a diversity based multiple access scheme for robust uplink transmission denoted as Block Interleaved Fre- quency Division Multiple Access (B-IFDMA) was proposed to be used in scenarios where transmit channel state information is not readily available due to the imposed overhead, e.g. as with high speed or low data rate and for short control packets. The scheme obtains its robustness by means of a dispersed allocation of multiple blocks with equidistant spacing in frequency, where each block consists of a few consecutive subcarriers in a few consecutive Orthogonal Frequency Di- vision Multiple Access (OFDMA) symbols over time (1). This resource allocation structure enables a tunable degree of frequency diversity and low allocation signaling overhead. Moreover, it provides support for high power amplifier (HPA) efficiency in the uplink by the use of a DFT-precoding step. In addition, the possibility of a sub-slot allocation enables robust and efficient transmission for small packets and, at the same time, improves the battery life in user terminals. The B-IFDMA multiple access scheme is a generalization of the DFT-precoded OFDMA with interleaved subcarrier"
2107968,20178,369,Hybrid ARQ using Modulation Switching,2009,"Abstract —Multilevel modulation schemes have variations in bit-reliabilities and each has different symbol reliabilities. Choosing the modulation scheme which has the greatest symbol reliability at target SNR on retransmissions offers more chances to get higher Hybrid ARQ performance by making the sum of total bit-reliabilities greater in the entire decoding block. This paper presents a novel Hybrid ARQ scheme which is focused on reducing the number of bits whose reliabilities are low and increasing the total sum of reliabilities of transmitted bits. Proposed Hybrid ARQ scheme achieves more performance gain when in combination with modulation level switching. Keywords-component; hybrid ARQ; modulation switching; bit-reliaility I. I NTRODUCTION In communication systems, one method for reliable communication is Forward Error Correction (FEC). FEC can correct errors using various coding schemes [1]. If FEC fails to correct errors, the receiver might request a retransmission to the sender. This request is called Hybrid Auto Repeat request (H-ARQ) which combines FEC and ARQ techniques. Hybrid ARQ techniques are used in many modern communication systems to improve the reliability of received data. Hybrid ARQ schemes can be classified into three types. In Type I Hybrid ARQ, when the receiver fails to decode a certain block successfully, it requests a retransmission and decodes the retransmitted block without any help of the initial block. In Type II Hybrid ARQ, when the receiver cannot correct the errors, the receiver stores the previously received bad blocks and request a retransmission. After receiving retransmitted block, the receiver can correct more effectively by combining the retransmitted block with previously received blocks. Type III Hybrid ARQ is the same with Type II Hybrid ARQ except the requirement of self-decidability of the retransmission blocks. There are two classes in Type II and III Hybrid ARQ schemes. One is Chase Combining (CC) and the other is Incremental Redundancy (IR). Chase Combining is to transmit the same packets as initial transmission and a decoder combines those packets in a symbol level or bit level [2]. This scheme needs only small buffer size in the receiver to get performance gain. The buffer size of CC is the number of bits in initial transmission. Incremental Redundancy is to send additional redundancy bits to initial transmission block to get more coding gain, combining received packets into longer codeword block than previous transmission codeword block. IR requires larger size of buffer in the receiver than CC. The buffer size of IR becomes the number of the total bits of the entire transmitted codeword block. The high order modulation schemes which transmit more than 2 bits in a symbol have different bit-reliabilities depending on the bit position in a modulation symbol because of the restriction of two dimensional constellation mapping [3][4]. One of the attempts to overcome the degradation of FEC performance which is caused by the different bit-reliabilities depending on the modulation mapping position is the constellation rearrangement scheme, which rearranges the signal constellation for retransmissions [5]. The constellation rearrangement scheme in effect averages the variation in bit-reliabilities over multiple transmissions. The constellation rearrangement schemes can be extended to MIMO systems [6]. In this paper, we focus on increasing the sum of bit-reliabilities in the entire codeword block on decoding as well as decreasing the number of bits which have low reliabilities. These can be achieved by proposed Hybrid ARQ scheme with modulation level switching. In section II we present the bit-reliabilities of QAM modulations measured by calculating LLR and introduce a method to select a modulation scheme for retransmissions. Then in section III we propose a novel Hybrid ARQ scheme whose performance gain increases when in combination with modulation level switching. Finally in section IV we provide simulation results including the proposed Hybrid ARQ performance. II. S"
2371943,20178,369,On the Ultra Wideband Propagation Channel Characterizations of the Biomedical Implants,2009,"is conducted. It is shown that the energy coupling due to the non-radiative near-field of the implanted antenna becomes dominant for the signal transmission, where the link quality can be improved significantly by exploiting the near-field coupling. The effect of the implanted antenna polarization for UWB signal transmission is studied and shown that better link quality is obtained by utilizing the antenna polarization along the width of the body. Furthermore, we show that the distance dependent path loss for inside body can be modeled by a power function but it can only be modeled with a known logarithmic function for outside body The antennas implanted deep inside human body are used to facilitate the communication links between medical sensors and exterior instruments for short range biotelemetry applications (1-2). The body implantable device needs low complexity, small size, and low power consumption due to low energy autonomy of the battery powered device. Ultra wideband (UWB) communication for implanted devices is a new topic and can be an interesting candidate for providing higher data rate warranted in the future implantable applications. Using UWB, the most of complexity is in the receiver that allows the realization of an ultra low power, low complexity transmitter in the uplink (from implanted sensor to the master). Moreover, the very little hardware complexity of UWB transmitter offers the potential for low cost and highly integrated solutions. Due to the high loss medium of the body tissues and the low transmitted power, the signal strength at the receiver becomes important to achieve high data rate transmission. Thus the strategies to optimize the UWB communication link quality are important. Therefore, we perform the simulation of the UWB channel between an in-body implanted antenna and in-body, on-body or off-body receiving devices. First, an implanted UWB antenna is designed and optimized for using at the chest of a human anatomy model. The model is analyzed using numerical electromagnetic (EM) code using time-domain finite integral equation (FIE) method to solve the Maxwell's equations. For this analysis, high resolution anatomy model HUGO (3) based on the data provided by the Visible Human Project of National Library of Medicine (4) and the wideband electric characteristic data of human biological tissues (5) are used. A frequency dispersive model associated to the tissue materials and a total of 15 different human tissues at the selected simulation region of the human torso are considered. UWB channel simulations for different polarized waves by transmitting from different oriented antennas inside the human body are conducted. The channels path loss models for both polarizations are presented. The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents UWB antenna design and implementation inside human body. Section III provides the human body model and associates frequency dependent material properties for the body tissues. Section IV provides the channel characteristics of the in-body implanted antenna for different wave polarizations and the associated path loss models. Section V concludes this paper."
2103928,20178,369,IQ Imbalance Reduction in a SMI Multi-Antenna Receiver by Using a Code Multiplexing Front-End,2009,"In this paper, we address the IQ imbalance sen- sibility of the code multiplexing front-end architecture. This innovative architecture has been recently proposed in order to reduce the analog complexity of an antenna diversity receiver front-end. An interesting characteristic of this structure is that the resulting IQ imbalance is equal for each received baseband signal. Associated with Single Matrix Inversion algorithm, this property ensures a high IQ imbalance robustness. A global antenna diversity system including analog front-end and digital processing has been implemented in order to perform simula- tion validation. Results show that the bit error rate does not increase significantly with the multiplexing and this increase is compensated for a high IQ imbalance. I. INTRODUCTION Introduced in 1984 by J.H. Winters (1), the antenna di- versity techniques are an interesting solution for advanced communication systems. They are used to increase the capacity and performances (quality of service QoS, datarate, ... )o f wireless networks. Several algorithms exist to take advantage of antenna diversity and to combine different signals arriving at the same receiver (6). In the 802.11g standard (2) study case, receivers are mostly used in indoor environments, with large angular spread, so it is very difficult to use high complexity algorithms such as ESPRIT or MUSIC (3) in order to compute the direction of arrival of signal of interest. Therefore, we pre- fer to take advantage of the training sequence used in 802.11g standard and to compute the optimal combination of different signals with the Sample Matrix Inversion (SMI) (4). This technique is efficient to increase capacity and performance, as well as to reduce the sensibility to IQ imbalance (5). However, this compensation is effective when the IQ imbalance is the same on each chain of the receiver, which is not really a realistic assumption. Recently, a new architecture of multi-antenna front-end ar- chitecture has been proposed in order to reduce the analog complexity. This architecture is based on code multiplexing and has been introduced by authors in (6). A global study has been done including Bit Error Rate (BER) performances, power consumption evaluation and implementation considera- tions. Some results already submitted for publication are given in this paper but here the main purpose is to assess the IQ imbalance sensibility of this type of receiver. We compare its performances to the classical structure for realistic IQ imbalance, the two systems using SMI processing. In order to evaluate this new antenna diversity receiver, BER simulations have been performed. This paper consists of 5 parts. Following this introduction, Section II describes the multi-antenna receiver and the new an- tenna diversity front-end structure is presented. In Section III, the theoretical models of this structure are given, including IQ imbalance. Section IV details some simulated performances. Finally, conclusions are drawn and follow-ups are provided.

2226886,20178,369,Distributed Sampling Design and Data Fusion for Signal Detection in Cluster-Based Sensor Networks,2009,"This work proposes a distributed sampling design for the signal detection application in the cluster-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Considering the energy saving require- ment in the cluster-based WSNs, a linear weighting data fusion scheme for data reduction at the cluster head is also developed in this paper. Both the distributed sampling and the data reduction schemes are designed based on Ali-Silvey distance measures. The objective functions are derived in a closed form and two numerical examples are presented to illustrate our distributed sampling design and data reduction scheme. Numerical results show that our sampling design outperforms the uniform sampling and is insensitive to the sampling jitter. The results also show that the performance loss caused by the data reduction is quiet small. Therefore, the proposed schemes are very suitable for the detection applications in battery-powered WSNs. Index Terms—Distributed sampling, Ali-Silvey distance, detec- tion, data fusion, sensor networks This work studies the distributed sampling design for the detection application in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs should be energy efficient due to the use of battery- powered sensor nodes. Cluster-based mechanism has been proposed to conserve the energy consumption in WSNs (1). In the cluster-based WSNs, nodes are organized into a number of clusters and the nodes within a cluster collaboratively sense the environment and the cluster head relays the sensing information to the destination or other cluster heads. In this topology, the distance between the nodes and their associated cluster head is much shorter than that between the cluster head and the destination or other cluster heads. Therefore, to conserve the communication energy, it is better for the cluster head to fuse the sensing messages collected from sensor nodes and reduce the amount of sensing information before transmitting the messages. In most situations, sensor observations are continuous-time in nature and need to be sampled into discrete-time samples. Sampling design for the Gaussian detection problem has been studied in (2)-(5), where the received signals under hypotheses H1 and H0 were Gaussian random processes. Both random and deterministic sampling schemes for the detection of known signals in Gaussian noise were considered in (2). Using the decision statistic based on the sampled data, instead of the continuous-time detector (matched filter or correlation receiver), naturally results in a degradation of performance. Deterministic and random sampling schemes were designed so as to minimize the degradation in the performance of the detector. In (3), an asymptotically optimal periodic sampling design for the Gaussian hypothesis testing problem was pre- sented. Under very general conditions, the probabilities of error decrease exponentially with increasing sample size. For this problem, an asymptotically optimal periodic sampling scheme was designed by maximizing the rate of exponential decrease. In (4), a universal approach based on the Ali-Silvey distance measure (ASDM) for the design of sampling schemes for Gaussian hypothesis testing problems was presented. In the strong signal case, sampling points were determined that max- imize the distance measures between the conditional densities. In the weak signal case, a new member of the class of ASDMs suitable for the weak Gaussian signal detection problem was developed. The sampling scheme was designed by maximizing the distance measure. A sampling design for weak signal detection in additive spherically invariant random process (SIRP) noise was also presented in (5). A new member of the class of ASDMs suitable for this problem was developed. It was also numerically shown that the sampling design is insensitive to the statistics (the characteristic PDF) of the SIRP noise samples."
2192973,20178,369,Predicting Small-Scale Fading Distributions with Finite-Difference Methods in Indoor-to-Outdoor Scenarios,2009,"Finite-Difference electromagnetic methods have been used for the deterministic prediction of radio coverage in cellular networks. This paper introduces an approach that exploits the spatial power distribution obtained from these techniques to characterize the random variations of fading due to multipath propagation. Although the presented method is equally applicable to any Finite-Difference algorithm able of computing electromagnetic field patterns (e.g. PSTD, ParFlow, ...), it has been exemplified here by means of FDTD. Furthermore, in order to test the reliability of this approach, the predicted fading distributions are compared against real measurements in a residential Indoor-to-Outdoor scenario. Finally, the practical usability of this fading prediction approach is tested throughout implementation in a WiMAX femtocells system-level simulator. I. INTRODUCTION The need for radio network planning tools that aid operators to design and optimize their wireless infrastructure is rising. In order to increase the reliability of these tools, accurate radio wave propagation models are necessary. But it is important to notice that the knowledge of the received signal level is not sufficient to evaluate correctly the performance of a system. Random small-scale fading creates changes in the received signal amplitude, that can have a profound impact on the quality of the reception, as well as on the global performance. Propagation prediction methods have been traditionally used to describe either indoor or outdoor environments. However nowadays, with nearly 60% of phone calls taking place in- doors (1), and the advent of technologies such as femtocells or indoor-located macrocells and handsets, the study of the indoor-to-outdoor propagation conditions is more necessary than ever. In this paper, the aim is first to use a deterministic prop- agation model, to provide a coverage map of the received signal at a very fine resolution. Then, in a second step, the distribution of the received signal can be analyzed to extract fading parameters that can be taken into account by a system- level simulation tool. In section II, the FDTD model implementation based on a measurements-based calibration is presented. Then in section III an indoor-to-outdoor fading model will be extracted from the FDTD propagation prediction, and matched against a measured fading distribution. Finally, section IV presents the inclusion of the indoor-to-outdoor fading model in a system- level tool to study the potential performance of a real system. As an example of the applicability of an indoor-to-outdoor fading model, the used scenario was that of a WiMAX femtocell hybrid network. To conclude, the advantages of using this approach for the prediction of fading will be be summarized."
2247664,20178,369,Vehicular Path Prediction for Cooperative Driving Applications through Digital Map and Dynamic Vehicle Model Fusion,2009,"This paper investigates the fusion of digital maps and dynamical models to accurately predict the future path of a vehicle. This path prediction is generated by a vehicle for sharing with other vehicles through wireless communication channels. This sharing is an enabler of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative systems. In particular, this work looks at cooper- ative safety and comfort systems, which benefit from accurate path predictions for collision avoidance and coordination with other vehicles. This work proposes that digital map information is valuable in giving a nominal estimate of the future path of the vehicle, and that this estimate can be augmented with real- time vehicle information, such as wheel speeds, yaw rates, and accelerations. Furthermore, dynamic short-term situations such as lane changes can be cleanly incorporated into the vehicular path prediction. Depending on the driving environment, the sensor quality, the map accuracy, and the map matching precision, this paper shows that this fusion has the potential to provide where-in-lane path predictions. I. INTRODUCTION Research into combining global navigation satellite sys- tems (GNSS) with wireless communication technologies is enabling future cooperative driving applications with benefits to safety, comfort, and mobility services. Comfort and mo- bility services, which look at reducing the driver's work load and increasing traffic flow respectively, likely will be the first applications of such wireless communications to production vehicles. These applications require fairly infrequent commu- nication updates and communication latency can be tolerated. Conversely, safety applications require high-frequency, low- latency communications that must contain precise vehicle positioning and orientation information. Although toughest on the communications requirements, it is safety applica- tions that can leverage the abundant amount of vehicle specific information in their message payloads. Whereas some cooperative mobility applications may be addressed by communication media (e.g., WiMAX) that is independent of the vehicle type or OEM-specific vehicle integration, safety applications must employ communication media (e.g., DSRC) with standardized message formats (e.g., SAE J2735) and security-layer definitions (i.e., IEEE 1609.2). This paper introduces a fusion technique for combining digital map data with vehicle specific measurements (e.g., CAN and GPS) to produce accurate short-time (i.e., 3- to 10-second) horizon path predictions. These path predictions incorporate dynamic vehicle models that are integrated over the time horizon to provide a continuous path prediction over the entire time horizon, and not just predicted vehicle positions at the end of the time horizon. The purpose of"
2097984,20178,369,Downlink Multi-Cell Radio Resource Management for Coordinated Base Stations,2009,"This paper addresses the design of joint multi-cell resource allocation and scheduling with coordination among neighboring base stations (BS). Considering Ns neighboring sectors, the solution that maximizes the sum-rate in the covered area is found for TDMA and TDMA/OFDMA access. The optimum solution exhibits low complexity as it presents the useful property that its computation admits a decomposition such that each BS is responsible for the selection of the users to be scheduled in its own sector. This result is proved analytically. In conventional cellular networks, frequency planning is usually considered to keep an acceptable signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) level, especially at cell boundaries. This approach, however, hampers the system spectral efficiency, particularly at low reuse rates. Depending on the allowed complexity and signaling overhead, multi-cell joint inter-cell radio resource allocation may bring significant gains. Intuitively, if users served from different BS experience a low level of interference, radio resources may be reused, thus increasing the system spectral efficiency. On the other side, if the served user experiences large interference, orthogonal transmissions with suitable power allocation are better. This paper addresses the design of intercell scheduling for neighboring sectors (belonging to different BS) when coordination among these BSs is available, and provides the optimum solution in terms of sum-rate. The weighted sum-rate is also considered in this paper. The weighting factors play the role of implicit linear utility functions, and allow to balance or to prioritize the resource allocation to those users or services with higher weights. In this way fairness issues or QoS criteria can be introduced. When the weighting factors are equal for all the users, maximizing the weighted sum-rate is equivalent to maximizing the system spectral efficiency. While the solution that maximizes the sum-rate is found to be simple in the TDMA case, it also exhibits reduced complexity for the OFDMA case since it involves the solution of a convex problem with a small number of variables. The solution involves sector-wise independent maximization, which is consistent with maximizing the capacity of each cell through multiuser diversity (1). Some coordination among the common resources assigned to each neighboring sector is required. Notation. We use boldface capital font for matrices and boldface lower-case for column vectors.

2285078,20178,369,A Decentralized Positioning and Tracking Method for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on a Low-Complexity Incremental Algorithm,2009,"This paper presents a low-complexity incremental (LCI) algorithm for target positioning and tracking in wireless sensor networks. The proposed positioning scheme calculates the estimated location of a target as a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem based on the distance estimation and solves the optimization problem in an iterative manner using the LCI algorithm. In the decentralized scheme, a participating sensor estimates a target's current location, and then passes that information on to the next participating sensor, which calculates the target's newest location estimate. In addition, a convergence analysis is given to show the convergence behavior of the LCI- based method. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has higher estimation accuracy than previous related algorithms in both stationary and moving target scenarios. adaptive modified incremental subgradient (MIG) method with a variable step size to solve the nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. These methods achieve better energy and bandwidth efficiencies, especially as network size increases. In (6), Hero and Blatt proposed a projection-onto-convex-sets (POCS) method with a critical criterion; this scheme can converge to the vicinity of the global optimum point. Similar to the POCS-based scheme, Shi and He (7) proposed a projection onto the nearest local minimum (PONLM) method, which is more effective than the POCS method. In the decentralized positioning approach, one major drawback of the IG-based, MIG-based, and POCS-based methods is that the gradient operator or the orthogonal projection operator needs to be calculated in each iteration operation. Thus, it is worth noting that a low-complexity scheme can be used to reduce the computational complexity and the calculation time of each sensor node at each iteration procedure. Therefore, we present a decentralized approach based on a low-complexity incremental (LCI) algorithm to solve the positioning problem using the RSS for wireless sensor networks. We consider each local sensor node's estimation of its distance, observation of its reference distance to the target, and the pre-estimated target location (from the sensor node responsible for the previous iteration), and then formulate the location estimation as a NLS problem to minimize the global cost function in an iterative manner. Using the decentralized approach, each participating sensor node is responsible for one computation operation using the LCI algorithm at each iteration process. A participating sensor node applies the LCI algorithm to revise the previous node's target location estimate and to obtain a new location estimate based on its own observation; it then passes the most recent update on to its neighbor sensor node for further processing. We also present a convergence analysis that guarantees a convergence behavior of our proposed method. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method not only can converge to a close approximation of the global optimal solution, but also has better location accuracy and tracking performance than previous IG-based, MIG-based, POCS-based, and PONLM-based methods."

Road experiments are important to validate new ideas and to guide new theoretical development. They offer a better under- standing of the VANET. This paper deals with experiments on the road. A simple architecture is sketched; it is composed of off-the-shelf hard- ware and a software suite, well adapted to the prototyping of new applications and protocols dedicated to dynamic networks. Experiments are reported and examples of results are given. This work is intended to help in the design of new road experimentations. I. INTRODUCTION A. Motivation These last years, Intelligent Transport System gain attention of the research community. It is expected that ITS will reduce the road fatalities (around 40,000 deaths per year in USA or Europe), increase the productivity and the profitability of the infrastructures, avoid traffic jams and reduce the impact of road transports on the environment. ITS involve the road infrastructure, the car manufacturers, the telecommunication infrastructures... They often rely on embedded systems and wireless networking facilities. Regarding the on-board applications that could be available in future vehicles, four families can be sketched. The first family is composed of the infrastructures oriented applica- tions. These applications rely on the embedded sensors in the vehicles and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in order to collect data from the vehicles. The information will be used by the infrastructure-side for optimizing the management of freeways, the goods' transportation, the emergencies' orga- nization.... The second family concerns the vehicles oriented applications. They rely on embedded sensors and infrastruc- ture forecast to give accurate information to the vehicles by means of infrastructure-to-vehicles (I2V) communications and vehicles-to-vehicles (V2V) communications. In this family, we find road safety applications such as vehicle behavior adap- tion, collision's prevention, inter-vehicles security distance management... The received information is processed by the embedded computers, and may affect the vehicle behavior. The applications are critical. The third family concerns the drivers oriented applications to ease the road usage.

In order to extend service to isolated areas, we propose hybrid architecture based on DVB-S2/RCS+WiFi networks. In this scenario the satellite channel is affected by deep rain events that do not allow ACM modes to protect data. Moreover, the delay in the ACM reaction to fade changes can affect the quality of the video transmission. In order to avoid the QoS reduction, we focus on different Fading Mitigation Techniques (FMT), designing a multi-layer scheme protection, using LL-FEC and AL-FEC in higher layers, and optimizing the intervention threshold and super-frame length in the physical layer. Keywords-component; DVB-S2, WiFi, LL-FEC, AL-FEC, Hybrid network, Tropical, video streaming However, since the maximum size of FEC frames is limited, and deep fading duration can be in the order of seconds, we additionally propose an Application Layer FEC solution (AL-FEC) like the one standardized for DVB-H (Handheld) and DVB-SH (DVB Satellite to Handheld), where FEC frames are allowed to be larger. Since the error protection we propose causes a noticeable delay, it cannot be used for real-time applications, which is why we focus on video streaming applications. In this paper we also demonstrate that, during the rain event, the delay in the ACM reaction to fade changes can affect the Quality of Service (QoS) of a multicast video streaming. Specifically, there is a noticeable delay (RTT of about 2 · 250ms plus DVB super-frame length) from the moment an RCS Terrestrial (RCST) detects an ongoing fade event to when it receives from the NCC the transmission with the modulation and coding rates appropriate to cope with the increased atmospheric attenuation. We verify that the LL-FEC, tuning of super-frame (SF) length and the intervention threshold are useful to compensate for the packet errors introduced by the ACM switching delay. Therefore, this work aims at demonstrating the improvement in QoS of the video transmitted in the hybrid network by using the proposed techniques and shows how to make efficient use of bandwidth in order to reduce costs in Amazon areas. The main parameters evaluated for this purpose are the packet error rate, the delay, and the bandwidth overhead due to the use of the proposed techniques. The received video will be evaluated by using the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) metric."
1781988,20178,369,Performance Analysis of Two-Way Multiple-Antenna Relaying with Network Coding,2009,"Two-way relaying is a way of improving the band- width efficiency of a half-duplex relay system. In such scenarios, network coding can also be applied to improve the system if there exist sufficient degrees of freedom to decode the received messages at the relay node. In this paper, we look at two specific transmission schemes employed at the multi-antenna relay node and analyze their performance by deriving both the upper bounds of their symbol error probability and their diversity order. I. INTRODUCTION In half-duplex relaying systems, system throughput is re- duced due to the additional time slot required for relaying information to the destination. In the situation where two nodes, node A and node B, exchange information through a relay node, this reduction of system throughput can be recovered by allowing both nodes to concurrently transmit information to the relay node. Known as two-way relaying (1), such systems rely on each node being able to retrieve the desired information by subtracting away their own contribution in the received message. In Amplify-and-Forward two-way relaying systems (1), the relay node receives a superposition of the messages from the two nodes and broadcasts an amplified version of the received message. In situations where the channel gains are very imbalanced, situations may arise where the performance becomes highly skewed. In such cases, it could be highly desirable that the messages are first decoded at the relay node before they are forwarded. Applying binary level network coding (2) to the decoded messages is also efficient, as one network coded symbol will be transmitted instead of two different symbols sharing the transmission power. Likelihood (ML) detector, the performance of a system in terms of diversity order was analyzed by using the Moment Generating function (MGF) of the instantaneous signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) (6). In this paper, using similar methods, we analyze the performance of a two-way relay system using Alamouti coding (open loop) and antenna selection (close loop) with network coded messages. We derived the upper bounds of the symbol error probabilities (SEP) and the diver- sity order of the two schemes. The paper is organized as the follows. In next section, we present the system model for the different transmission schemes. In Section III, we derive an upper bound for the average SEP as well as the diversity order for each scheme. In Section IV, we present the numerical results and compare them with our analytical results. We then conclude our paper in V."
2206091,20178,369,An Efficient Multiuser Relaying Scheme for OFDMA Systems,2009,"This paper proposes an efficient multiuser relaying scheme in OFDMA systems. In the proposed scheme, multiple terminals transmit packets simultaneously in the same subband and multiple relay stations retransmit their received signals in dif- ferent subbands after subband conversion. The base station (BS) extracts each packet from multi-dimensional signals received at the different subbands. In advance of data transmission, the BS's scheduler selects appropriate terminals for packet transmission such that the BS can detect each packet correctly. Numerical results show that the proposed relaying scheme achieves much higher system throughput than the conventional relaying scheme. I. INTRODUCTION Future wireless systems envisaged to support high data rate communications create transmit power problems since high data rate transmission requires large transmit power at a terminal of limited power capability. A relaying scheme, which can extend coverage area saving the transmit power, has been considered as an attractive solution (1)-(4) to this problem. So far, various types of relaying schemes have been inves- tigated for future wireless systems. These relaying schemes can be basically categorized into analog repeater, amplify-and- forward (AF) or decoding-and-forward (DF) relaying in digital fields, and higher-layer relaying. Although clear comparison of different categories would be an issue for future study, AF relaying in digital fields has advantages in simple structure, low cost, and capability of frequency selection for relaying. Meanwhile, it has drawbacks in causing delay at baseband processing and spending double radio resources compared to direct transmission. Therefore, more efficient digital AF relaying scheme would be needed towards future wireless systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient multiuser relaying scheme to support low-mobility terminals in uplink of orthog- onal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. In the proposed scheme, multiple terminals transmit their data packets simultaneously in the same subband and multiple RSs retransmit their received signals in different subbands after subband conversion. A base station (BS) extracts individual data packets from multi-dimensional signals received at the different subbands. In advance of data packet transmission, the BS's scheduler selects appropriate terminals for data packet transmission so that the BS can receive individual data packets successfully. The proposed scheme can reduce radio resources Fig. 1. Conventional relaying scheme (a) with 1 relay station (b) with multiple relay stations. required for a packet transmission, since multiple terminals transmit their packets simultaneously in a subband. In perfor- mance evaluation, we show that the proposed scheme achieves higher system throughput than the conventional scheme. It should be noted that the proposed scheme can multiplex more packets than the number of the BS's antennas, apart from (5)(6). The proposed scheme does not use channel state information at relay stations, apart from (7). Furthermore, this paper presents flexible subband conversion at a relay station depending on the number of relay stations and link capacity."
1873793,20178,369,Media Independent Handover Management in Heterogeneous Access Networks - An Empirical Evaluation,2011,"The constant evolution on the telecommunications sector particularly with the increasing development of wireless technologies has led to the diversification of access networks solutions. Nowadays technologies like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, UMTS and LTE are a set of heterogeneous networks that provide mobile broadband access to multiple devices, from smartphones to laptops or tablets. This diversification alongside with the appearance of multi-technology terminals and user ubiquitous access requirements, brought enormous challenges to mobility management in heterogeneous network environments. To address this issue the IEEE group has been working on a standard in order to optimize mobility procedures through different access technologies, the IEEE802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services. The goal of this standard is to support and improve handovers regardless the access technology used by defining an abstraction layer called Media Independent Handover Function (MIHF) between Layer 3 and Layer 2 and below (MAC and PHY). This paper focuses on the performance of this framework by presenting an Enhanced Mobility Manager (EMM) entity capable of performing terminal and handover management using this framework. The EMM was deployed and tested in a real heterogeneous network environment providing Wi-Fi, WiMAX and HSPA networks access with IPv6 and MIPv6 support. To evaluate a real usage scenario a Android mobile device was used. The results show that IEEE 802.21 framework meets the proposed objectives by enabling both seamless handover between different Radio Access Technologies and QoS provisioning. This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents related work regarding the IEEE802.21 and mobility management developments, Section III briefly introduces the IEEE802.21 framework and its main goals. Section IV describes the proposed mobility management entity and how it can be integrated with the IEEE802.21 framework in order to control and execute handover procedures. Section V describes how the EMM was developed, how it works and presents the implemented testbed details. In Section VI the methodology used to perform the performance evaluation is presented and results are presented and discussed. Finally, Section VII presents the conclusions and future work possibilities."
2642680,20178,369,Flexible Digital Predistortion for Future Spectrally-Agile Waveforms and 5G Radio Systems,2015,"In this article, we focus on the RF and digital front-end design and implementation challenges associated with future 5G radio access systems with special emphasis on spectrally contained waveforms and small-cell system scenarios. In general, ﬁlter bank based multicarrier (FBMC) type of techniques have various potential beneﬁts due to their excellent spectral containment compared to classical OFDM(A). However, these spectrally contained waveforms lose their intriguing spectral properties when power ampliﬁer (PA) nonlinearities are considered. Flexible and efﬁcient digital predistortion (DPD) algorithms are thus considered an interesting solution in order to restore the spectral containment of such advanced 5G waveforms. Noncontiguous spectrally-agile transmission is another key feature of future 5G systems for increasing data rates and spectral allocation ﬂexibility. However, the PA nonlinearities impose even more severe challenges in such noncontiguous transmission scenarios due to the resulting spurious intermodulation emissions that can easily violate the emission limits or even desensitize the own receiver in frequency division duplexing based systems. Furthermore, at the network deployment level, different small-cell concepts are expected to play a major role in future 5G networks. Unlike the ordinary macro base-stations, the digital computing capabilities in small-cell base-stations are much more limited. Furthermore, they should also adopt lower-cost and small-size analog RF components, while still maintaining high energy-efﬁciency. The afore-mentioned constraints, along with advanced 5G waveforms, call for ﬂexible and low-complexity DPD solutions, a challenge addressed in this article. We report novel DPD methods with built-in capability to direct the linearization performance to pre-deﬁned frequencies or subbands in a ﬂexible manner, and demonstrate their good performance and complexity beneﬁts in the context of non-contiguous FBMC transmission."
1885223,20178,369,On Maximizing the Data Volume in a Wireless Sensor Network with Time-Varying Channels,2009,"In this paper we present an analytical solution to the problem of jointly optimizing transmit power and scheduling for a star network of wireless energy-limited sensors around the base station. We have included factors which are usually neglected in modeling sensors and their communication channel. These include: accounting for power utilized for activities other than transmission, i.e. processing power, and time variations of the channel gains throughout the lifetime of the sensor. With an information theoretic approach to this problem, we have avoided the details of modulation and pulse shaping, and accounted for the mutual interference in simultaneous sensor transmissions. We employ the volume of data received at the base station over the lifetime of all sensors as the system performance measure and prove that in the optimal scheduling scheme sensors should avoid simultaneous transmissions. In addition, we show the optimal transmit powers that maximize the data volume can be determined via water-filling over the sensor's lifetime once the processing power and the single sensor transmission schedule are accounted for. In this work we have assumed prior knowledge of the channel gains throughout the lifetime of all sensors. Nevertheless, the solution will provide an optimistic value for the network's maximum data volume achievable by a causal scheduler. I. INTRODUCTION In gathering data from the coverage area of the network and conveying it to the base station, a wireless sensor net- work faces two main issues: mutual interference in sensor transmissions and limited battery energy. The problem of interference is particularly pronounced in the area surrounding the base station, because of the congestion produced by traffic concentration. Increased interference and congestion in this area, accelerates battery depletion in the sensors directly con- nected to the base station and reduces the volume of data that these sensors can convey to the base. Since their efficiency in communication limits the overall performance of the network, it is critical that we devise an optimal transmission scheme for these sensors. To improve our understanding of the factors involved and to eliminate unrelated elements, we segregate this area from the rest of the network and study it in isolation. In modeling sensors, aside from accounting for their limited energy source, we have taken into account the power utilized for functions other than transmission and termed it processing power. Although processing power introduces complications in the solution, it is an essential detail in employing a practical sensor model. To our knowledge this work is one of few that includes processing power in the sensor model."
2013024,20178,369,Planning of Frequency Reuse and Relay Station's Location for Cellular Relaying Networks,2009,"This paper investigates an amplify and forward (AF) relaying scheme compatible with a legacy wireless system in cellular environments. In the proposed scheme, terminals and relay stations use different frequency bands for signal transmission. The two frequency bands for terminals and for relay stations are used by individual frequency reuse factors in cellular environments. We study frequency planning and a relay station's location for high spectral efficiency. The numerical results show that the spectral efficiency of a relaying scheme is enhanced by deploying a relay station close to the base station (BS) and using frequency reuse factor 1 for a relay station to BS link. I. INTRODUCTION Future wireless systems envisaged to support high data rate communications create transmit power problems since high data rate transmission requires large transmit power at a terminal of limited power capability. A relaying scheme, which can extend coverage area saving the transmit power, has been considered as an attractive solution (1)-(3) to this problem. When a relaying scheme is newly introduced into a legacy wireless system, a smooth migration from the legacy wireless system to an advanced wireless system with relaying has been envisaged. For smooth migration, it is essential to maintain compatibility between the legacy and advanced systems. For instance, in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Long Term Evolution (LTE)-advanced system with relay functions is expected to support LTE terminals which follow control procedure of LTE specifications ((4) etc.). It is also important for the advanced system to achieve high spectral efficiency. In this paper, we investigate an amplify and forward (AF) relaying scheme compatible with a legacy wireless system in an uplink of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. In the presented scheme, a relay station (RS) retransmits the received signal after changing a subband of the received signal. Thus, terminals and RSs use differ- ent frequency bands for signal transmission. The proposed relaying scheme can be applied to a legacy system by adding extra bandwidth for relaying. The proposed relaying scheme is compatible with legacy terminals, because it does not change any frame format of the legacy system. In the presented system, terminals can transmit signals without being aware of relaying transmission. We further study planning of frequency reuse factor (FRF) and appropriate location of a RS in cellular environments. In the presented scheme, frequency band for Fig. 1. A relay transmission model. terminals and that for RSs are used by individual frequency reuse factors. We analyze spectral efficiency under various FRFs and RS's locations to find a good FRF and RS's location. Although this paper assumes an OFDMA system on uplink, the proposed scheme can be straightforwardly applied to SC- FDMA scheme (4) by adding DFT processor at a terminal's transmitter part."
2154888,20178,369,A Branch and Bound Algorithm for Extending the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks,2009,"One of most critical issues in power-constrained wireless sensor networks is to maximize the network lifetime. Recently, studies have been made on scheduling sensor activity to prolong network lifetime. In this paper, we address the maximum set covers (MSC) problem to maximize the network lifetime and propose an energy-efficient sensor scheduling algorithm for the MSC problem based on the branch and bound approach. Simu- lation results show that the proposed algorithms can contribute to extending the network lifetime and its performance is better than the existing greedy-based algorithm. Index Terms—Branch And Bound Algorithm, Wireless Sensor Network, Network Lifetime, Power Saving, Sensor Scheduling. I. INTRODUCTION One of the challenging problems in designing sensor net- works is to lengthen the lifetime of sensor networks. Recently, studies have been made on designing a scheduling scheme which allows sensor nodes to alternate between active and sleep mode. Such a scheme allows redundant nodes to enter the sleep mode so that the network lifetime gets prolonged. In this paper, we address the scheduling problem in the target coverage model. In the target coverage model, there is a set of targets with known location in an area and a large number of sensor nodes are deployed randomly in the proximity of the targets. The objective is to maximize the lifetime of such a power constrained sensor network to cover (monitor) the targets. (1) introduces a novel model of maximizing the network lifetime of the target coverage model by organizing sensor nodes in non-disjoint set covers. It defines the maximum set covers (MSC) problem and proves that the MSC problem is NP-complete. Thus a heuristic algorithm is required to solve it. A scheme to solve the MSC problem should find the maximum number of non-disjoint sensor set covers (sensor groups) such that each group covers completely all the targets. Sensors in a group should be active in a scheduling time. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the MSC problem: LP (linear programming)-MSC and Greedy-MSC. The authors show that Greedy-MSC has lower complexity and running time than LP- MSC and also that Greedy-MSC increases the network lifetime more than LP-MSC. In this paper, we propose a new sensor scheduling algorithm for the MSC problem based on the branch and bound approach (2), (3). The branch and bound algorithm is generally known as a good tool for finding an optimal solution of a given optimization problem. Unexplored subspaces of the solution space are represented as nodes in a dynamically generated search tree, which initially only contains the root, and each iteration generates such a node. A iteration has three main steps: selection, branching, and bound. These steps will be newly defined in this paper so that they are appropriate to solve the MSC problem. The heart of proposed algorithm is to find sensor groups covering the minimum number of overlapped targets. An overlapped target is the target sensed by adjacent sensors at the same time. Each sensor will monitor different numbers of targets. A sensor that covers more targets would gather more data and thus it will consume more energy (4). That is, when a sensor group for the MSC problem contains the sensors covering many overlapped targets, the energy wasted by such sensors become much (5). The bound step in our branch and bound algorithm has the rule which reflects this energy-saving strategy. To evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance, we con- duct simulation analysis and its results show that the proposed algorithms can contribute to extending the network lifetime and its performance is better than the existing greedy-based algorithm."
1295544,20178,369,Cooperation-Based Network Coding in Cognitive Radio Networks,2014,"We consider a scenario consisting of a primary and a secondary system, each represented by a pair of a transmitter and a receiver. The secondary transmitter assists in the retransmission of the primary message, which prevents the primary performance from being degraded by allowing the secondary system to access the transmission resources. Two network coding schemes applied in retransmission phase are investigated, the stationary network coding (SNC) scheme and the adaptive network coding (ANC) scheme. For each scheme we derive analytical results on packet throughput and infer that the ANC scheme outperforms the SNC scheme. We then provide a numerical performance comparison and a numerical optimization of the secondary packet throughput. Our main result shows cooperation can provide a significant performance improvement through effective network coding. I. INTRODUCTION Cooperation among nodes in a cognitive radio network is often applied due to the inherent ability of intelligently collect- ing and utilizing information (1), (2). Relaying (3) in particular is commonly used. Typically the secondary system may be allowed to access the primary spectrum, operating as a relay for the primary system in return for obtaining transmission opportunities. In this paper, we consider secondary cooperative relaying through network coding. Network coding is widely used to improve network throughput, efficiency and scalability. Instead of simply relaying the packets of information, inter- mediate nodes combine several packets for transmission. Here, we focus on delay-insensitive data services, where Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) is applied for packet error recovery. ARQ enables the application of network coding in broadcast and multicast networks. Network coding schemes on broadcast channel are proposed in (4), where the sender combines and retransmits the lost packets within one transmission and multiple receivers are able to recover their lost packets. In (5), a relay assisted multicast is studied, where the relay node broadcasts the packets through network coding to all receivers. Birk and Kol proposed network coding in multiple- unicast networks (6), (7) for efficiently supplying nonidentical data from a central server to multiple caching clients. We advance this view by establishing a cognitive radio network with network coding applied at the secondary transmitter over a broadcast channel to both primary and secondary receivers. In our work, two network coding schemes are investigated for use in the retransmission phase, and the performance is"
1520202,20178,369,Effect of the Aeronautical L-DACS2 Radio-Frequency Signals on the DME System Performance,2010,"In this paper, we consider the Radio-Frequency Compatibility (RFC) of a candidate system for the future aeronautical communication infrastructure. This infrastructure is being developed within the International Civil Aviation Organization since 2004, to accommodate the air traffic load and improve the aerial security. The system presented in this paper is one of the two preselected proposals for the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (L-DACS), which will be responsible for the continental communications. This proposed candidate is named L-DACS2 and is foreseen to use part of the L-band spectrum (960 to 1164 MHz) allocated to the Aeronautical Mobile Service reserved for communications relating to safety and regularity of flight. Despite its potentially large spectrum, the L-band is a challenging environment for aeronautical communications because of the channel propagation characteristics and the dense spectral occupation by a large number of aeronautical systems. On the other hand, the RFC characterizes the electromagnetic compatibility between two radio systems and determines if they can coexist in the same electromagnetic environment. For this reason, the RFC is one of the main issues for L-DACS deployment and if it is not satisfied, the flight safety could be endangered. Hence, we propose to study in this paper the impact of the L-DACS on the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), which is a very important equipment that has been using this band for decades. According to recent studies performed in the frequency domain , that is assuming continuous transmissions and no time domain variations, the achieved RFC level seems insufficient. The main objective of this work is to analyze the RFC between L-DACS2 and DME taking into account the time domain aspects of both systems. The idea is to verify and quantify the impact of the radio- frequency signals generated by a L-DACS2 interferer on the performance of a DME victim receiver. The study is performed for the co-site case (\emph{i.e.} when both equipments are onboard of the same airplane), which is the most critical interference scenario due to the proximity of both systems. The results are obtained through computer simulations as well as laboratory measurements. They present the DME performance degradation for some values of the Signal to Interference Ratio, assuming a constant DME signal level and different L-DACS2 interference powers."
2223229,20178,369,Measurement-Based Investigation of 60 GHz Broadband Transmission for Wireless In-Car Communication,2009,"In this paper we investigate the 60 GHz in-car wide- band radio channel to assess the feasibility of 60 GHz high bit rate radio communication inside a car. The investigations are based on a measurement campaign comprising different application- oriented transmission scenarios and propagation conditions. We analyze the channel gain, time dispersion and frequency selec- tivity. Finally, we derive the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and cover interference aspects. I. INTRODUCTION Today, premium class cars are equipped with a multitude of electronic entertainment and infotainment devices like DVD players, in-car-TV, navigation systems, cameras etc. Those devices are typically connected to each other via the automo- tive cable harness consisting of wires for various bus systems and point-to-point links. The cable harness in current vehicles has a significant weight that may exceed 30 kg. In particular, when utilizing higher bit rates for the data communication, this figure would even grow further due to necessary cable shielding and bulkier connectors. It becomes evident that a reduction of CO2 emissions in cars can also be achieved by utilizing alternative ways of data communication within the vehicle. Future broadband 60 GHz systems are supposed to operate in the unlicensed band from 57 to 64 GHz and are a can- didate for wireless indoor (1) and in-cabin (2) high speed internet access as well as real-time video streaming. It is well known that the channel characteristics strongly depend on the propagation environment (3). Results in the literature mostly refer to 60 GHz indoor channels (4). Very few results are available for more specific scenarios like aircraft cabins (2). To the authors' knowledge the millimeter wave in-car channel has not been considered yet. In this paper we thoroughly investigate the 60 GHz in-car wideband radio channel on the basis of measurement results for a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) to assess the feasibility of 60 GHz high bit rate radio communication inside a car."
2351659,20178,369,Application of an Impedance Tuning Network for Mobile DVB-H Terminals,2009,"This paper presents the application of a reconfig- urable impedance tuning network for a mobile DVB-H terminal. These kind of networks are becoming widely used in wireless communication systems to improve its efficiency. On the other hand, antenna design in DVB-H terminals is challenging due to the size limitation and as a result, the antenna presents large mismatches. To address this issue, we propose the use of a reconfigurable tuning network to reduce the mismatch (or the antenna size for a given mismatch) between the antenna and the RF front-end in a DVB-H terminal. This technique offers some advantages over other proposed alternatives and improves the antenna realized gain, as well as the efficiency of the DVB-H receiver. I. INTRODUCTION Reconfigurable tuning networks are called to play an impor- tant role in the development of new multistandard RF front- ends in wireless communication systems based on software defined radio. The benefits and applications of this kind of networks are promising. One of its main applications is to match the output impedance of the power amplifier stage to the antenna input impedance for allowing the maximum power transfer. This idea may also be exploited in reception, to get an optimum power transfer from the receiver antenna to the reception chain, typically leaded by a low noise amplifier (LNA) or a filter and a LNA. This application is specially interesting for mobile DVB-H terminals, where the antenna design is stimulating due to the frequency band (470�702 MHz) defined in the European DVB-H standard (1). In this bandwidth, DVB-H has a wavelength of 640 mm in the lower frequencies, while a handset is usually much shorter. As a result, the antenna presents large mismatches which lead to a decrease in the receiver efficiency. The idea of using impedance tuning networks to fix this problematic was already stated in (2). In this work, the design of the impedance tuning network for DVB-H applications is presented, although only improvement in terms of VSWR for an audio ear piece and an FM antenna are shown. Results are not presented for a real DVB-H antenna, and no improvement in terms of realized gain are reported. Nevertheless, its perfor- mance with a real DVB-H will probably be very satisfactory in terms of matching and realized gain improvement. The classical way to face up the problem here stated, is based on the design of tunable antennas (3)-(10), extensively"
2405207,20178,369,Performance of MUSIC and COMET Algorithms in the Presence of Scatterers in a 3-D Hemispheroid Surrounding the Source,2009,"In this paper, we evaluate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance of MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Clas- sification) and COMET (COvariance Matching EsTimator) algorithms in the presence of dispersion in azimuth and eleva- tion. We use a 3D hemishperoid scattering model to describe angle of arrival in azimuth and elevation. We derive a closed- form expression for the joint and marginal Probability Density Function (PDF) of the uplink Angle Of Arrival (AOA) in azimuth and elevation. The base station is elevated to support the macrocellular model where the scatterers are distributed about the mobile (MS). We also compare the PDF of AOA and the simulated histogram. Index Terms—Angle of arrival, geometric scattering model, three-dimensional propagation, MUSIC algorithm, COMET al- gorithm In order to increase the number of users in cellular systems with a limited band spectrum, adaptive arrays are currently being investigated for cellular and personal communications. To evaluate the performance of different receivers and Angle Of Arrival (AOA) estimation algorithms using simulations, statistical channel models, which provide AOA of the multipath components, are required. The performance of adaptive arrays algorithms can significantly differ depending on the propagation conditions, and hence a realistic channel model is required. Many models are proposed in the literature to describe the scaterrers distribution around the mobile like the Clark's model (1), which assumes that the signals arrive horizontally at the receiver antenna and uniformly along the azimuthal coordinate. Several geometric models are currently available such as the ring model, circular scattering model, elliptical scattering model, gaussian model (2) (3) (4) etc., All the above models are two dimensional. In this paper we introduce a 3-D geometric model that can better perform the practical case. The study of the spatial properties of the received signal is necessary for evaluation of the performance of a wireless communication system using antenna arrays. The spatial properties are known if we estimate exactly the AOA of a signal coming from the mobile."
1457991,20178,369,Vehicle-to-Vehicle Real-Time Relative Positioning Using 5.9 GHz DSRC Media,2013,"Vehicular accidents are one of the deadliest safety hazards and accordingly an immense concern of individuals and governments. Although, a wide range of active autonomous safety systems, such as advanced driving assistance and lane keeping support, are introduced to facilitate safer driving experience, these stand-alone systems have limited capabilities in providing safety. Therefore, cooperative vehicular systems were proposed to fulfill more safety requirements. Most of cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle safety applications require relative positioning accuracy of decimeter with an update rate of at least 10 Hz. These requirements cannot be met via direct navigation or differential positioning techniques. This paper studies a cooperative vehicle platform that aims to facilitate real-time relative positioning (RRP) among adjacent vehicles. The developed system is capable of exchanging both GPS position solutions and raw observations using RTCM-104 format over vehicular dedicated short range communication (DSRC) links. Real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning technique is integrated into the system to enable RRP to be served as an embedded real-time warning system. The 5.9 GHz DSRC technology is adopted as the communication channel among road-side units (RSUs) and on-board units (OBUs) to distribute GPS corrections data received from a nearby reference station via the Internet using cellular technologies, by means of RSUs, as well as to exchange the vehicular real-time GPS raw observation data. Ultimately, each receiving vehicle calculates relative positions of its neighbors to attain a RRP map. A series of real-world data collection experiments was conducted to explore the synergies of both DSRC and positioning systems. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in precision and availability of relative positioning at mobile vehicles."
2206840,20178,369,Performance Analysis of Anti-Collision Protocols for RFID Systems,2009,"Recently RFID technology has made its way into end-user applications, enabling automatic item identification without requiring line of sight. In particular passive tags provide a promising, low cost and energy-efficient solution for inventory applications. However, their large-scale adoption strictly depends on the efficiency of the identification process. A major challenge is how to arbitrate channel access so that all tags are able to answer the reader inquiries and identify themselves over time. This paper stems from the observation that a variety of anti- collision protocols for RFIDs have been proposed in the literature. However, a thorough simulation comparison among them and a clear identification of the mechanisms resulting in better end- to-end performance is lacking. The objective of our work has been to fill this gap. This paper presents the results of a detailed ns2-based comparative evaluation of representatives of all the classes of anti-collision protocols so far proposed. Simulation results show that end-to-end performance of the different classes of protocols in terms of metrics such as the time needed for tags identification differ significantly over what previously found by experiments which only focused on the number of reading cycles for tag identification. Our thorough performance evaluation has highlighted that different solutions are to be used in different application scenarios and that decreasing the collisions (rather than idle times) is the way to go to further improve anti-collision protocols performance. I. INTRODUCTION A basic RFID system consists of a reader and a set of tags. The reader inquiries tags that are able to communicate on the radio channel, returning their ID. Tags are typically passive devices, which answer to reader's query by back- scattering the received signal. One of the main objectives of a RFID system is the identification of all the tags present in the area covered by the reader. The challenges related to tags identification depend on the reference scenarios, which may include one or more readers, and a variable or stationary set of tags. The coexistence of multiple readers in the same area may cause collisions among readers interfering with each other or with tags. Moreover, collisions may occur among tags simultaneously transmitting to the same reader, indepen- dently of the presence of one or more readers. Collisions are addressed by specific solutions for the multi-reader problem (through frequency allocation mechanisms) and the single- reader problem (through collision arbitration schemes). The other distinguishing factor is given by scenario variability. In case of stationary applications scenarios (i.e., consecutive readings of the same, slightly changed, set of tags), the reader"
2229004,20178,369,SNR Adaptive Limited Constellation Sphere Decoding,2009,"Sphere Decoding algorithm has been shown to achieve near Maximum Likelihood (ML) performance with low complexity for MIMO communication systems, but still has higher complexity than other suboptimum detectors. Especially at low SNR, the complexity of sphere decoding algorithm gets much higher. In this paper, sphere decoding algorithms combined with other suboptimum detectors are proposed. Pre-estimated vectors by suboptimum detectors such as MMSE V-BLAST are used to assist sphere decoding algorithm. The number of search points in the tree search lattice area can be restricted, and the complexity can be reduced significantly. The number of limited constellation points can be changed by considering the trade-off between bit-error-rate (BER) performance and complexity. If we adjust the number of limited points according to SNR, we can achieve the BER performance close to that of an optimal sphere decoding algorithm, and lower complexity than the Schnorr- Euchner algorithm. I. INTRODUCTION Many detectors which are used for MIMO communication system have been investigated in the literature. Among them, maximum likelihood (ML) decoder has good performance but it is not practical since its complexity increases exponentially with the number of transmitted symbols and the size of mod- ulation constellation. Suboptimum detectors like zero forcing (ZF),minimum mean square error (MMSE), MMSE V-BLAST can be implemented easily because of the low complexity but their bit-error-rate (BER) performance is not optimal. Sphere decoding algorithm can have the BER performance of ML decoder with moderate complexity. However the complexity of a sphere decoder is still much higher than other suboptimum detectors, so we may still have difficulty implementing a sphere decoder. The complexity of sphere decoding is depen- dent on the choice of the initial radius, because it determines the number of vectors inside the hypersphere. The complexity is dependent on the constellation size. The tree search order is related to the complexity if the algorithm updates a radius like Schnorr-Euchner algorithm. SNR affects the complexity especially at low SNR because low SNR enlarges hypersphere size to be searched over. Many sphere decoding algorithms are proposed to address the above issues. The Fincke-Pohst algorithm uses a fixed and small initial radius but decoding can be a failure if there is no lattice vector in the hypersphere (1). The Schnorr- Euchner algorithm updates the radius adaptively with little BER degradation, and reduce the complexity (2). In order to use small initial radius without decoding failure, some sphere decoding algorithms use other suboptimum detectors (3). The K-best algorithm restricts the number of child nodes at each dimension so its BER performance is not optimal (4). This paper proposes a modified sphere decoding algorithm to reduce the complexity and to maintain the BER performance (close to that of an ML detector) using predetection of other suboptimum detectors. A suboptimum detector solution such as MMSE V-BLAST is first calculated, we can use that solution to determine the initial radius and the tree traversal order. The number of lattice vectors to be searched over is restricted to the neighborhood of the solution to decrease the complexity. We will also adjust the number of lattice vectors according to SNR. This paper is organized as follows. We provide an overview of the existing sphere decoding algorithms, and the compu- tational complexity in Section II. Section III proposes the limited constellation sphere decoding algorithm using pre- estimated vector by suboptimum detectors. SNR adaptive limited constellation sphere decoding algorithm is proposed in Section IV. Performance and complexity comparisons with other sphere decoding algorithms are simulated in Section V. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section VI."
1854956,20178,369,Performance Evaluation of MIMO Systems with Transmit Antenna Selection over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels,2009,"In this paper, we investigate MIMO systems with transmit antenna selection over an intra-class correlated Rayleigh fading channel. In our study, one single transmit antenna with an aim to maximizing the total received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected for transmission, while it is assumed that the receive side use all the available antennas. Using binary- phase-shift-keying (BPSK) modulation as an illustration, we derive the exact bit error rates (BERs) of two diversity schemes, namely transmit antenna selection and full complexity schemes. Moreover, we compare the asymptotic performance of the two diversity schemes analytically. The effect of correlation among the sub-channels on the SNR degradation is also determined in terms of the correlation coefficient and the number of transmit/receive antennas. Finally, results show that the transmit antenna selection scheme can achieve better performance than the full complexity scheme at the expense of a small amount of feedback information from the receiver. Index Terms— Multiple-input Multiple-output, transmit an- tenna selection, intra-class correlation, Rayleigh fading. antenna selection over a specifically correlated Rayleigh fading channel, namely an intra-class correlated channel. In this model, the correlations between any pair of correlated antenna elements are equal. It is used to describe the scenario when the antenna elements are closely placed with correlations between any two elements almost identical. The results of the study are important because they offer deep insights for engineers designing the MIMO systems. In our study, we assume that all the available receive antennas are used at the receive side, whereas only one single transmit antenna will be selected for transmission with an aim to maximizing the received signal-to- noise ratio (SNR). The MIMO system with antenna selection can be regarded as a extension of the conventional diversity system under a fading channel. Based on the results of diver- sity systems under an equally correlated Nakagami-m fading channel, we derive the exact BERs of MIMO systems under an intra-class correlated Rayleigh channel with two different selection schemes, namely transmit antenna selection (TAS) and the full complexity (FC) schemes. Then, the asymptotic SNR degradations due to correlation are quantified in closed forms expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient and the number of antennas. We also compare the SNR requirements of the two selection schemes at low BER regions. We conclude that the TAS scheme can achieve better performance than the full complexity scheme at the expense of a small amount of feedback information from the receiver."
2003650,20178,369,Performance analysis of SIMO space-time scheduling with convex utility function: zero-forcing linear processing,2004,"In a multiple-antenna system, an optimized design across the link and scheduling layers is crucial toward fully exploiting the temporal and spatial dimensions of the communication channel. In this paper, based on discrete optimization techniques, we derive a novel analytical framework for designing optimal space-time scheduling algorithms with respect to general convex utility functions. We focus on the reverse link (i.e., client to base station) and assume that the mobile terminal has a single transmit antenna while the base station has n/sub R/ receive antennas. In order that our proposed framework is practicable and can be implemented with a reasonable cost in a real environment, we further assume that the physical layer involves only linear-processing complexity in separating signals from different users. As an illustration of the efficacy of our proposed analytical design framework, we apply the framework to two commonly used system utility functions, namely maximal throughput and proportional fair. We then devise an optimal scheduling algorithm based on our design framework. However, in view of the formidable time complexity of the optimal algorithm, we propose two fast practical scheduling techniques, namely the greedy algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). The greedy algorithm, which is similar to the one widely used in 3G1X and Qualcomm high-data-rate (HDR) systems (optimal when n/sub R/=1), exhibits significantly inferior performance when n/sub R/>1 as compared with the optimal approach. On the other hand, the GA is quite promising in terms of performance complexity tradeoff, especially for a system with a large number of users with even a moderately large n/sub R/. As a case in point, for a system with 20 users and n/sub R/=4, the GA is more than 36 times faster than the optimal while the performance degradation is less than 10%, making it an attractive choice in the practical implementation for real-time link scheduling."
2234580,20178,369,The Impact of Fixed and Moving Scatterers on the Statistics of MIMO Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channels,2009,"In this paper, we study the impact of fixed and moving clusters of scatterers on the statistics of multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels. Double-bounce scattering is assumed for fixed scatterers, while single-bounce scattering is considered for moving scatterers. Starting from the geometrical street model, an analytical ex- pression is derived for the channel gain taking into account the contributions of fixed and moving scatterers in a multiple-cluster scattering scenario. The statistical properties of the proposed channel model are studied. Analytical solutions are provided for the three-dimensional (3D) space-time cross-correlation function (CCF), the 2D space CCF, and the temporal autocorrelation func- tion (ACF). All theoretical results are validated by simulations. different from single-bounce models. In fact, for double- bounce models the angles of departure (AoD) and the angles of arrival (AoA) are independent. This is in contrast to single- bounce models where the AoD and the AoA are closely related. Due to this dissimilarity, the statistical properties of double-bounce models and single-bounce models are different. Therefore, double-bounce models should be studied carefully. Furthermore, the presence of moving scatterers in a highway environment has a big impact on the channel behaviour. For this reason, we study the effect of passing vehicles on the channel statistical properties. Measurement results in (10) have shown that the amplitude of waves scattered from more than one vehicle is small and the practical impact of vehicular scattering is confined to single-bounce rays. Therefore, double- bounce scattering from moving scatterers has been neglected in our model. When scatterers are moving with a high speed relatively to the transmitter (receiver) the AoD (AoA) become time-variant resulting in a non-stationary channel model. How- ever, when vehicles are facing road congestion, the relative speed of the cars in the vicinity of the transmitter or the receiver is low. In such conditions, we can still consider the AoD and the AoA as non-time-variant during a sufficiently large period of time. This assumption can be accepted espe- cially if the scatterers are moving in the same direction as the transmitter and the receiver. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the geometrical street model is presented. Based on this geometrical model, we derive a reference model in Section III. In Section IV, we study the correlation properties of the proposed channel model. Numerical results of the correlation functions are presented in Section V to validate all theoretical results by simulations. Finally, Section VI provides some concluding remarks."
2167044,20178,369,Multi-User Detection for Improving VoIP Capacity and Coverage in WCDMA Uplink,2009,"In this paper, we study how the capacity and coverage of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) in the WCDMA uplink can be improved by us- ing advanced base station receivers capable of multi-user detection (MUD). To avoid the complexity of joint-detection, a multi-stage successive interfer- ence cancellation (SIC) detector or parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detector is used as an implementation of MUD. To further reduce complex- ity, time-division multiplexing (TDM) is used to separate user groups in time so that MUD can focus on a smaller number of overlapping signals. SIC or PIC cancels a number of temporarily detected user signals from the receive signal before detecting another user signal. A temporarily detected user signal can be regenerated based on demodulated data or decoded data, and based on hard-decision values or soft-decision values. We find that a two-stage SIC or PIC process improves VoIP performance significantly and having more detection stages beyond two does not further improve perfor- mance by much. The improved performance allows a VoIP user to reduce the average transmit power, which translates to VoIP capacity and coverage increases. Furthermore, we find that the individual user performance is not sensitive to its detection order. We also quantify the relative performance between the various signal regeneration schemes considered. As expected, post-decoding interference cancellation (IC) offers a significant gain over pre-decoding IC. Furthermore, we find that post-decoding IC is robust to traffic load variations. Also, soft-decision based cancellation achieved the best performance. However, the performance improvement is small com- pared to hard-decision based cancellation. Finally, we see that MUD can work with G-Rake to suppress one dominant other-cell interfering signal, e.g., due to a high-data-rate user in another cell."
2156624,20178,369,Weak Interactive Systems Design in Wireless Broadcast Channels,2009,"Massive informations transmission in wireless broadcast channels has many well-known problems. This is an asymmetric environment where broadcasting the information is an effective and good way to make the information available simultaneously to a large number of users, however the optimization of the bandwidth allocation implies more attention. Moreover we have to make point of the limited battery capacity of mobile devices. In this paper we will present some solutions making use of weak interactivity, that is useful in case of possible low bandwidth and permits a minimization in communication channel utilization. Informations selections are done on the device itself. In a second phase we will deal with informations and their organization in indexed structures: this is important when using devices with limited memory and a low processing capability. During last years we attended at a rapid development and at a following diffusion of wireless-communication technology, that is causing a convergence between high- speed wireless networks and personal mobile devices. Mobile computing is the result and in near future a massive number of mobile users will access a great variety of informations at any time from everywhere, with their portable devices that are frequently low power-battery. In mobile environments data are disseminated by a base station or a satellite to mobile clients through wireless channels and data broadcast is an actractive solution in this context. In fact the bandwidth resource is limited and broadcast allows these massive accesses from clients to the data and is preferable to point-to-point delivery. In addition most wireless systems are asymmetric: the downlink, from the base station to the client, has a much higher communication capacity than the uplink in the opposite direction. In push-based broadcast data are disseminated proactively and repeatedly while clients passively listen to the channel, filter data and pick only the ones they need, so the load on the uplink channel decreases."
1848130,20178,369,User Separation for OFDMA Uplink,2009,"Separating user signals in the uplink (UL) of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system without access to the subcarrier assignment scheme (SAS) is a challenging task, but it can have a number of useful applica- tions. In this paper, a semi-blind user separation algorithm is proposed, which assumes time synchronization and availability of information on the type of SAS used. The proposed algorithm estimates the carrier frequency offsets and time delays of each frequency allocation block by exploiting the cross-correlations over pilot subcarriers. A clustering method to group the blocks is employed, where each group belongs to a different user. Mathematical model of the proposed algorithm is presented, and possible user separation applications in OFDMA-based femtocells are discussed. Feasibility of the algorithm is proved through practical simulations. Index Terms— Carrier frequency offset estimation, cognitive radio, delay estimation, femtocell, OFDMA, user separation. I. INTRODUCTION The uplink (UL) of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems poses a number of challenges that do not exist in the downlink (DL) due to the involvement of multiple users. Most of these problems including mul- tiuser channel estimation (1), carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation (2), synchronization and symbol timing estimation (3), (4), multiuser interference cancellation (5), and subcarrier and power allocation (6) are investigated extensively in the prior-art. However, the problem of separating UL user signals without access to the subcarrier assignment scheme (SAS) has not been investigated in detail in the literature, which may have interesting applications. User separation in UL-OFDMA might be attractive for military communications, where it may be used for purposes such as eavesdropping. Another real-world scenario where user separation might be quite useful is a cochannel femtocell coexisting with a macrocell network, both of which have an OFDMA based physical layer. Assuming that the coexistence is based on a shared spectrum approach where the femtocell utilizes the available parts of the macrocell spectrum in an opportunistic manner, user separation can be very beneficial to the femtocell as discussed in detail in Section IV."
2812406,20178,369,The Technical and Economic Consequences of Protecting GSM-R in Sweden,2016,"A number of protection criteria were implemented by the Swedish regulator PTS in order to protect the GSM-R operations in Sweden. In order to protect the GSM-R receivers from interference and blocking, two different constraints were implemented: First, a limitation of the out-of-band emissions from the mobile operators' existing base stations operating in the 900MHz band was implemented. Secondly, a limitation of the aggregated power received over the railroad within the operator's spectrum allocation in the 900 band was added. In this study, the background of these protection criteria is presented and their technical and economic consequences estimated. Regarding out-of-band emissions from base stations, four alternative protection levels have been investigated: -92, -95, -98 and -107 dBm. It is found that in order to meet these requirements, safety distances of between 280 and 1200m need to be introduced, which means that between 1500 and 2700 base stations would be needed to be taken out of service. In order to avoid blocking, the received power over the embankment from each base station within the public GSM band would also be needed to be limited. The consequences of limiting the received power levels to either -10, -23 or -40 dBm were here investigated. Given the level of blocking protection, it is found that between 1085 and 2330 base stations within the vicinity of the railway track would be affected and possibly needed to be shut down To avoid causing interference, all operators - with the exception of Hi3G - may limit their out-of-band emissions by installing filters on the base stations. The cost of such installations is estimated at 50 000 SEK per base station. Depending on the protection level that is applied, the estimated total cost for the mobile operators is between 67 and 113 million SEK (about 12 million Euros). In order to protect the GSM-R receivers from blocking, some 3500 locomotives would need to be equipped with additional filters at a total cost of around 130 million SEK (about 14 million Euros)."
2825665,20178,369,LOcal interferenCe compensATion (LOCATe) for GNSS-Based Lane-Specific Positioning of Vehicles,2016,"Rotten bridges and highways, the raised population density and car penetration as well as daily and long-time roadworks are just a few reasons of the modern transportation challenge: the steadily increase of traffic density. This unavoidable trend also comes along with the well-known negative effects such as traffic jams, car accidents and CO2 emissions. Hence, current research approaches aim on generally valid and accurate positioning of vehicles to enable the direct traffic-flow prediction and manipulation. But although this is a well-known demand in the present times, there is still no generally valid solution to fit this lack of technology. Modern satellite-based solutions are widely accessible, but without any extensions they lack the necessary accuracy and/or reliability, especially in urban environments. Local extensions or independent positioning solutions are, by definition, limited to the local scenario and cannot be installed in every region to provide a widespread service. Thus, this paper investigates a cloud-aided, lane-specific position determination of vehicles using a model-based and therefore, generally applicable approach, the so-called Local Interference Compensation (LOCATe), to enable a more detailed lane-accurate traffic prediction (e.g., by detecting short-dated roadworks or car breakdowns). Thereby, the scientific challenge is to predict, quantify and compensate the inevitable local impacts to the positioning accuracy using ordinary and resource-constrained (Global Navigation Satellite System) GNSS receivers. In addition to the detailed explanation of LOCATe itself and some already implemented adaptations for traffic scenarios, this paper provides independently the analytical as well as the experimental validation using a Software-Defined GNSS Receiver solution."
2128830,20178,369,Efficient Rate-Power Allocation for OFDM in a Realistic Fading Environment,2007,"The implementation of practical adaptive resource allocation scheme remains a key criterion to be satisfied for realising spectrally efficient multitone wireless communications. The ever-increasing demand for spectrally efficient broadband wireless transmission technologies has spurred intensive research leading towards the implementation of adaptive OFDM and adaptive MIMO systems. Efforts in this direction have been frustrated however by the lack of a clear and accurate description of the fading behaviour typically encountered in the broadband wireless transmission environment. This has been partially been overcome by the use of mathematical modelling which captures certain large-scale characteristics of the channel and facilitates theoretical research. The average channel parameters gleaned from these processes is typically then used to inform the design and configuration of wireless networking equipment after the broad application of generous safety margins. The resulting solution is therefore quite robust to certain transient channel quality degradation yet the generous safety tolerances render it unable to exploit other transient transmission quality improvements We seek to overcome the problems associated with this approach by applying a theoretically sound novel adaptive resource allocation framework to actual broadband wireless channel development data. The allocation framework is derived from the optimal OFDM allocation scheme for a known channel: the channel development data is obtained from actual measurement of a broadband wireless mobile environment, Prediction techniques are employed to overcome the time lag between channel assessment and symbol transmission. We present the details of the predictive resource allocation scheme used and include a broad characterisation of the transmission environment in terms of the time-varying fading processes observed. We provide some results of the application of this scheme as typical performance levels that may be achieved in an actual transmission environment."
1987476,20178,369,Capacity bound of mimo systems with mpsk modulation and superimposed pilots,2005,"The enormous capacity potential of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is based on some unrealistic assump- tions, such as the complete channel state information (CCSI) at the receiver and Gaussian distributed data. In this paper, in frequency-flat Rayleigh fading environment, we investigate the ergodic capacity of MIMO systems with M-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK) modulation and superimposed pilots for channel estimation. With linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation, the optimal pilots design is presented. We also derive an easy-computing closed-form lower bound of the channel capacity. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation between the data and pilots is investigated by numerical optimization. It is shown that more power should be devoted to the data in low SNR environments and to the pilots in high SNR environments. I. INTRODUCTION In this paper, we investigate the MIMO channel capacity with MPSK modulation and superimposed pilots. Since it is hard to derive the exact closed-form expressions, we tackle this problem by finding a closed-form lower bound of the capacity. Consider the communication over a wireless channel with N transmit and M receive antennas and distorted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We adopt a block-fading chan- nel model where the fading gains between all antenna pairs are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading and remain constant for coherence interval of length T (in symbols) before changing to a new independent realization. H ∈ C M ×N denotes the channel matrix. The entries of H and the AWGN matrix V ∈ C M ×T are i.i.d. complex Gaussian variables with zero mean and unit variance. We further assume that the transmitter has no channel information thus equal power allocation is adopted on the transmit antennas. Under superimposed pilots scheme, the pilot and data vec- tors are transmitted simultaneously. Thus the received signal matrix can be expressed as Y = ρ/NHX + V"
2221140,20178,369,A Novel MIMO Detection Scheme Based on D-S Evidence Theory,2009,"This paper proposes a novel detection scheme based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The focal-element-set (FES) characterizes the uncertainty contained in the decision statistics, and the corresponding basic-probability-assignment (BPA) of FES is the likelihood measure, acting as the soft-decisions of the transmit signals. The uncertainty can be counteracted during combining the soft information sources from all receive anten- nas, so more reliable decisions are achieved. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms its conventional detection schemes counterparts with only moderate complexity increases. (9), data fusion (10), and has been shown to achieve a satis- factory performance. In MIMO systems, the communication channel constructed by each of the transmit-receive antenna pairs is independent and stochastic, and the received signal is contaminated by noise. Therefore, there is uncertainty in the local decision statistics associated with each of the receive antennas. As a theory to manage uncertainty, the D-S evidence theory is just a good choice for combining all receive antennas' soft-decision information and making reliable decisions. In MIMO systems, the local decision statistic from each of the receive antennas contains uncertainty due to channel noise, so its hard decision is unreliable. Alternatively, the decision statistics from all of the receive antennas are implemented soft- decisions in this treatise, and BPAs act as soft information. The uncertainty of statistics is characterized by the FES, and the corresponding BPA of the FES is a likelihood measure, which is assigned by the proposed probability-density function (PDF)-based approach. In the proposed detection scheme, soft information sources from all of the receive antennas are aggre- gated by invoking the Dempster's combination operator, and the uncertainty is counteracted during the combination process. Considering that the more information sources for aggregation the greater possibility in making reliable decisions, the DS detection is designed as an iterative algorithm. To examine the performance of the proposed iterative DS detection algorithm, simulations are implemented and demonstrate that compared with conventional MMSE and MMSE-SIC detection schemes, the proposed scheme significantly improves the system re- liability with only moderate complexity increase. Moreover, compared with the SD detector, the complexity of the proposed scheme is lower."
1427208,20178,369,Performance Evaluation of A Resource Allocation Scheme for Mixed Traffic in Dynamic-TDD Network,2014,"Dynamic uplink and downlink reconfiguration is studied as an effective method to improve the system packet throughput performance in the LTE Heterogeneous Network. There are various kinds of traffic with different quality of service requirements in the practical wireless network, which has not been fully considered by the existing resource allocation strategies for dynamic TDD. In this paper, a resource allocation scheme coordinating the time and frequency resource for mixed traffic in the dynamic TDD scenario is proposed, which can guarantee the system requirements, such as time delay budget, packet drop rate and packet throughput. Utilities of users with different services are considered in the scheduling and dynamic UL-DL reconfiguration. Theoretical analysis and system level simulation are carried out to evaluate the performance. The simulation results show that compared with the existing resource allocation schemes, the proposed one offers a better performance, which are low packet drop rate of VoIP users and high packet throughput of FTP users. like best effort (BE) data traffic without delay requirement. The other one is real-time (RT) services with QoS requirements about packet drop rate and packet delay, such as VoIP or video service. It's of great significance to consider differences of the mixed traffic to avoid the waste of resource and improve users' experience. There have been several algorithms for the dynamic uplink- downlink resource allocation. In (2), the amount of UL/DL data to be transmitted in the buffer is calculated for reconfiguration. In (3), the reconfiguration is based on the UL and DL data currently in the buffer and considers the impact of historical traffic data, while full bandwidth scheduling with simple First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule is used for frequency resource allocation. The spectral efficiency of UL or DL is also taken into account, and latency-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler is used (4). However, these algorithms only deal with certain traffic model without consideration of the quality of service (QoS) requirement. The QoS aware reconfiguration method for mixed traffic is proposed in (5), but the FIFO"
2720324,20178,8228,Indoor 5G 3GPP-like channel models for office and shopping mall environments,2016,"Future mobile communications systems are likely to be very different to those of today with new service innovations driven by increasing data traffic demand, increasing processing power of smart devices and new innovative applications. To meet these service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as high as 10 Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency of less than 1 msec. To reach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in the range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth channels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100 GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not addressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz. This paper presents a preliminary overview of the 5G channel models for bands up to 100 GHz in indoor offices and shopping malls, derived from extensive measurements across a multitude of bands. These studies have found some extensibility of the existing 3GPP models (e.g. 3GPP TR36.873) to the higher frequency bands up to 100 GHz. The measurements indicate that the smaller wavelengths introduce an increased sensitivity of the propagation models to the scale of the environment and show some frequency dependence of the path loss as well as increased occurrence of blockage. Further, the penetration loss is highly dependent on the material and tends to increase with frequency. The small-scale characteristics of the channel such as delay spread and angular spread and the multipath richness is somewhat similar over the frequency range, which is encouraging for extending the existing 3GPP models to the wider frequency range. Further work will be carried out to complete these models, but this paper presents the first steps for an initial basis for the model development."
2037578,20178,10228,Ultra-Wideband channel model for intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks,2012,"Intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks is a promising new research area that can provide part cost, assembly, maintenance savings and fuel efficiency through the elimination of the wires, and enable new sensor technologies to be integrated into vehicles, which would otherwise be impossible using wired means, such as Intelligent Tire. The most suitable technology that can meet high reliability, strict energy efficiency and robustness requirements of these sensors in such a harsh environment at short distance is Ultra-Wideband (UWB). However, there are currently no detailed models describing the UWB radio channel for intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks making it difficult to design a suitable communication system. We analyze the small-scale and large-scale statistics of the UWB channel based on a measurement campaign for a variety of sensor locations beneath the chassis of a vehicle. The analysis for large-scale statistics show that the characteristics of the channel around the tires is very different from the other parts under the chassis. The path loss exponents around the tires and under chassis are 4 and 2.2 respectively. The clustering phenomenon observed in the averaged power delay profile can be well-modeled by Saleh-Valenzuela model. The clusters decay exponentially with arrival time but with a smaller decay constant after 30ms. The decay rate of ray amplitudes is increasing with delay and can be modeled using a dual slope linear model in logarithmic scale. The best fit for inter-cluster arrival time is Weibull distribution. The analysis for small-scale statistics on the other hand show that the best fit for the received energies in each bin at 81 locations of the measurement grid is lognormal distribution with decreasing μ and almost constant σ parameters. Moreover, different bins of the delay can be assumed to fade independently. This is the first work to model small-scale channel characteristics for intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks."
1489880,20178,369,5GNOW: Challenging the LTE Design Paradigms of Orthogonality and Synchronicity,2013,"LTE and LTE-Advanced have been optimized to deliver high bandwidth pipes to wireless users. The transport mechanisms have been tailored to maximize single cell performance by enforcing strict synchronism and orthogonality within a single cell and within a single contiguous frequency band. Various emerging trends reveal major shortcomings of those design criteria: (1) The fraction of machine-type-communications (MTC) is growing fast. Transmissions of this kind are suffering from the bulky procedures necessary to ensure strict synchronism. (2) Collaborative schemes have been introduced to boost capacity and coverage (CoMP), and wireless networks are becoming more and more heterogeneous following the non-uniform distribution of users. Tremendous efforts must be spent to collect the gains and to manage such systems under the premise of strict synchronism and orthogonality. (3) The advent of the Digital Agenda and the introduction of carrier aggregation are forcing the transmission systems to deal with fragmented spectrum. 5GNOW will question the design targets of LTE and LTE-Advanced having these shortcomings in mind. The obedience of LTE and LTE-Advanced to strict synchronism and orthogonality will be challenged. It will develop new PHY and MAC layer concepts being better suited to meet the upcoming needs with respect to service variety and heterogeneous transmission setups. A demonstrator will be built as Proof-of-Concept relying upon continuously growing capabilities of silicon based processing. Wireless transmission networks following the outcomes of 5GNOW will be better suited to meet the manifoldness of services, device classes and transmission setups being present in envisioned future scenarios like smart cities. The integration of systems relying heavily on MTC, e.g. sensor networks, into the communication network will be eased. The per-user experience will be more uniform and satisfying. To ensure this 5GNOW will contribute to upcoming 5G standardization."
2030690,20178,369,Spectral Efficiency Enhancement Using Multiaccess Scheme in Heterogeneous Network,2009,"In this paper, we propose a spectral efficiency en- hancement algorithm through simultaneous accesses to heteroge- neous networks, where a mobile station (MS) can simultaneously access different non-interfering networks with different radio access technologies (RATs). This simultaneous access (i.e., RAT diversity) is determined in terms of the distributed optimal solution, which implies that MSs can decide whether they connect with multiple RATs or not. To derive the optimal solution, we first show the advantages of multiaccess (MA) by an example in heterogeneous networks, and analyze the spectral efficiency of MA in multi-RAT system. Through our analysis and simulations, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve the increase of spectral efficiency compare with vertical handoff (VHO) method, which selects only one network having the best channel quality. As a result, the proposed MA algorithm can be considered as a viable solution to get more spectral efficiency in heterogeneous environments. and signaling flows to provide low-speed data over a large cov- erage area and high-speed data service over a geographically small area. Another integration model and system architecture of ad-hoc networks and cellular system is evaluated in (9). Especially, (4) deals with radio resource management (RRM) strategies in an integrating wireless networks, and evaluates the economic revenue of dynamic channel allocation using the utility function based on pricing. These works show some integration models and interworking architectures of heteroge- neous wireless systems, so we need to consider a multiaccess (MA) transmission for increasing the system capacity. This paper analyzes the spectral efficiency of MA scheme in heterogeneous networks, where MSs are allowed to access to their spectrum bands with different radio access technologies (RATs). We first show a simple example of MA to support the advantage of spectral efficiency, and then propose a simultaneous MA algorithm. The proposed MA algorithm is modeled and analyzed in terms of spectral efficiency. Through our analysis and simulations, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve an increase in spectral efficiency, as compare with vertical handoff (VHO) methods, which select"
668826,20178,369,Unified error probability analysis for generalized selection diversity in Rician fading channels,2002,"Motivated by practical considerations in the design of low-complexity receiver structures for wideband cellular CDMA, millimeter-wave and ultra-wideband communications, the study on the generalized selection combining receiver that adaptively combines a subset of M strongest paths out of L available paths has intensified over the past few years. The study on GSC(M, L) receiver is also important from a theoretical standpoint because this model encapsulates both the classical selection diversity and maximal-ratio combining (coherent detection) or post-detection equal-gain combining (noncoherent detection) receiver structures as limiting cases. We first derive a concise analytical expression for the moment generating function (MGF) of the GSC(M, L) output signal-to-noise ratio with independent and identically distributed diversity paths over Rician fading channels (in terms of only a single finite range integral whose integrand is composed of tabulated functions). Previous studies have only treated either Rayleigh or Nakagami-m (1960) channel models using numerous ad-hoc approaches to simplify an M-dimensional nested integral that arise in the computation of the MGF. The novelty of our mathematical framework for computing the MGF relies on the fact that it allows us to treat all common multipath fading channel models (Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m and Nakagami-q) in a unified sense, it leads to a much More elegant and computationally efficient expression than those available in the literature, and it holds for any combinations of M and L values. Using this newly derived MGFs, we provide a unified error probability analysis for many coherent and noncoherent digital modulation/detection schemes in a myriad of fading environments."
2515053,20178,369,A Performance of Cooperative Relay Network Based on OFDM/TDM Using MMSE-FDE in a Wireless Channel,2009,"Cooperative networking schemes provide spatial diversity gain (named cooperative diversity gain) using the antennas of spatially distributed users to form a multi an- tenna transmit situation. A variety of algorithms for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) networks have been developed to achieve cooperative diversity gain. OFDM signals, however, have a problem with a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) leading to lower power efficiency, which may significantly increase the user power consumption. In this paper, instead of conventional OFDM, we present the performance of coop- erative network based on OFDM combined with time division multiplexing (OFDM/TDM) using minimum mean square error frequency-domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) in a frequency- selective fading channel. To fully exploit the channel frequency- selectivity and achieve a larger frequency diversity gain the equalization weights required for OFDM/TDM signaling based on MMSE criteria are derived. multiplexing (12) (in this paper called OFDM/TDM) can be used to solve the PAPR problem to some extent (13). In OFDM/TDM design, the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) time window (i.e., OFDM/TDM frame) of conventional OFDM is divided into K slots. Within each slot an OFDM signal with reduced number of subcarriers is transmitted with- out the guard interval (GI) insertion. Unlike the conventional OFDM, only one GI is inserted in each frame and frequency domain equalization is used to exploit the channel frequency- selectivity. In this paper, we present the performance of cooperative relay network based on OFDM/TDM using minimum mean square error frequency domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) (13) in a frequency-selective fading channel. To fully ex- ploit the channel frequency-selectivity and achieve a larger frequency diversity gain the equalization weights required for OFDM/TDM signaling based on MMSE criteria are de- rived. Unlike cooperative relay network based on conventional OFDM, the use of OFDM/TDM achieves a better quality of service (i.e., a lower bit error rate (BER)) with a higher transmit power efficiency. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec- tion II presents the system model. We derive the required equalization weights for OFDM/TDM to achieve improved performance in Sect. III. In Sect. IV, computer simulation results and discussions are presented. Section V concludes the paper."
1841107,20178,369,Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks over Correlated Log-Normal Shadowing,2009,"A fundamental component to enable Dynamic Spec- trum Access (DSA) capabilities in the future generation of wire- less communication systems is the design of robust and efficient spectrum sensing methods to detect licensee users transmitting in a given frequency band. In this context, collaborative methods have been proposed to improve spectrum sensing capabilities over wireless channels, by counteracting shadow-fading phenomena via distributed diversity. However, recent results have shown that the expected benefits of cooperation, which are obtained at the expenses of increased traffic overhead and the need for a control channel, may be significantly hampered when the signals sensed by the cooperative users experience correlated shadow- fading. Moreover, it has been argued that spatial correlation of shadow-fading yields fundamental limits to the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing methods, and practical implications in terms of protocol design and network deployment. Motivated by the above considerations, in this paper we propose an analytical framework for the analysis and design of cooperative spectrum sensing methods over correlated shadow- fading environments, when each cooperative user is equipped with a simple energy-based detector. We will show that the framework requires efficient and accurate methods for modeling the power-sum of correlated Log-Normal Random Variables (RVs), which well describe shadowing phenomena. In particular, three main technical contributions can be found in the present paper: i) we generalize some recently proposed methods to approximate the power-sum of independent Log-Normal RVs to correlated scenarios, ii) we analyze the accuracy of several approximation techniques to compute detection probability over correlated Log-Normal shadowing, which is an unexplored field so far, and iii) we rely on the proposed framework to study the detrimental effect of correlation on the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing methods. Furthermore, numerical results will be shown to validate the proposed framework."
2248478,20178,369,On the Performance of Device-to-Device Underlay Communication with Simple Power Control,2009,"We address Device-to-Device (D2D) communication as a potential resource reuse technique underlaying the cellular network. We consider the shared channel of the two systems as an interference channel and formulate the statistics of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of all users. The potential performance of D2D communication is evaluated by considering a scenario where only limited interference coordination between the cellular and the D2D communication is possible. We apply a simple power control method to the D2D communication which constrains the SINR degradation of the cellular link to a certain level. Results show that the SINR statistics of the D2D users is comparable to that of the cellular user in most of the cell area. Scheduling gain is possible by properly assigning either of the Downlink (DL) or the Uplink (UL) resources to the D2D communication. D2D communication shares the same resources with the cellular communication while staying under control of the cellular network. Thereby the utilization of the spectrum can be increased and similar services as those foreseen for cognitive radio systems can be supported. As for cognitive radio systems, the D2D communication must not generate harmful interference to the primary service, i. e. the cellular network. This is much easier than detecting white spaces because the interference from the D2D communication can be controlled by the cellular network. In this paper, we study D2D communication performance conditioned on a prioritized cellular service in a single cell environment. We assume a scenario where full interference coordination between the cellular and the D2D communica- tions by the BS is not possible because of the lack of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) related to the links between the cellular and D2D terminals. The system design is thus based on cell statistics. We first study the statistics of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of the users. The SINR behavior is formulated in a scenario where the position of one D2D user in the D2D pair is fixed and the maximum distance between the D2D pair is constrained. The D2D distance constraint is sensible in practice since this allows the cellular network to control the mean channel condition between the D2D users. Using the formulated SINR distribution, we apply power control to the D2D communication in order to limit the impact of D2D communication to cellular communication. Results show that the SINR distribution of the D2D users is comparable to that of the cellular user in most of the cell area. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: In Section II we give the system model of the considered D2D underlay communication. The geometric distribution of the users and the channel model are also discussed here. In Section III, we formulate the whole-cell averaged SINR distribution of the cellular and the D2D users. In Section IV, we study numerically the SINR performance of D2D commu- nication while restricting the SINR degradation of the cellular communication due to the D2D communication."
1155901,20178,8839,Challenge: mobile optical networks through visual MIMO,2010,"Mobile optical communications has so far largely been limited to short ranges of about ten meters, since the highly directional nature of optical transmissions would require costly mechanical steering mechanisms. Advances in CCD and CMOS imaging technology along with the advent of visible and infrared (IR) light sources such as (light emitting diode) LED arrays presents an exciting and challenging concept which we call as visual-MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) where optical transmissions by multiple transmitter elements are received by an array of photodiode elements (e.g. pixels in a camera). Visual-MIMO opens a new vista of research challenges in PHY, MAC and Network layer research and this paper brings together the networking, communications and computer vision fields to discuss the feasibility of this as well as the underlying opportunities and challenges. Example applications range from household/factory robotic to tactical to vehicular networks as well pervasive computing, where RF communications can be interference-limited and prone to eavesdropping and security lapses while the less observable nature of highly directional optical transmissions can be beneficial. The impact of the characteristics of such technologies on the medium access and network layers has so far received little consideration. Example characteristics are a strong reliance on computer vision algorithms for tracking, a form of interference cancellation that allows successfully receiving packets from multiple transmitters simultaneously, and the absence of fast fading but a high susceptibility to outages due to line-of-sight interruptions. These characteristics lead to significant challenges and opportunities for mobile networking research"
2125918,20178,369,A Heuristic Relay Positioning Algorithm for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,2009,"In this paper we investigate the impact of a Relay Node (RN) placement plan on a heterogeneous wireless network called Hybrid Wireless Network with dedicated delay nodes (HWN*) in terms of system capacity, transmission delay and Quality of Service (QoS). A novel HWN* Heuristic RN Placement (HHRP) algorithm, which considers RN assistance & support for radio resource sharing such as inter-network traffic balancing, TD/CDMA soft handover, routing and user mobility has been implemented. A system level simulation is used to quantify the benefits of HWN* using HHRP algorithm over HWN* with other RN placement plans and multi-hop cellular networks. I. INTRODUCTION A heterogeneous wireless network refers to a wireless net- work that is comprised of wireless nodes with different radio access technologies or equipment with different operating systems. For example, it can be a wireless sensor network including bluetooth based radio access and zigbee 802.15.4 based radio access or a hybrid wireless network including cellular access and 802.11b/g based radio access. Specifi- cally for a hybrid wireless network, the increase of cellular communication intensity results in a reduction in cell size, thus much denser clusters are required resulting in increased infrastructure cost and system complexity. Meanwhile, the bursty nature of communication traffic and path loss results in traffic prediction difficulty. A solution must be found to provide effective resource management, congestion control and routing. The hybrid wireless network which incorporates cellular and MANET interfaced RELAY nodes, provides a practical approach for this. Nevertheless, the dedicated relay infrastructure approach can be also be adapted to the emerging wireless sensor network in order to maintain node connectivity, support sensor data aggregation and optimise power consump- tion."
1998756,20178,8228,An Improved Joint M-Algorithm for Single Antenna Interference Cancellation in TDMA Mobile Radio,2007,"We target  M -ary data sequence estimation over time-variant frequency selective fading channels subject to co- channel interference (CCI). A novel joint reduced state sequence estimator is presented cancelling a dominant interferer by joint detection. It works similar to a Joint M-Algorithm (JMA), but with a metric minimizing the  expectation  of the Euclidian distance between received signal and convolution of channel and data hypotheses. In this way, we overcome the well known dependence of reduced search techniques on the partial channel energy. Co- Channel interference (CCI) as well as intersymbol-interference (ISI) is modelled as Gaussian noise and considered in the metric. This approach dramatically reduces the number of states to obtain a certain performance compared to JMA. The resulting joint breadth first tree detector combines good performance with low complexity. For low velocities, the technique can work with an initial channel estimate as data detector only, termed Joint Improved M-Algorithm (JIMA). For higher velocities, two Joint Iterative Channel Data Estimation (JICDE) techniques are discussed. The complexity of JIMA is linear in the alphabet size of each individual user and approximately linear in the channel memory. In comparison to known reduced state sequence estimators, no Front End Prefilter (FEP) to shorten the channel is needed. We propose a receiver with fixed parameterization. The GSM/EDGE signal model is used, 16 states are sufficient for detection of an 8-PSK signal, 3 states are needed for a GMSK-signal to yield performance similar to a 64 state Joint Delayed Decision Feedback Sequence Estimation (JDDFSE)."
2689153,20178,369,Edge-Level Real-Time Traffic Estimation with Limited Infrastructure,2015,"In developing countries like India, limited Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure is available and it is difficult to generate real time traffic information for city wide or larger regions. On the other hand, cellular network is widely deployed in India covering major part of the road network. However, cellular network based positioning data have large location error (250-500 meters) and is not directly useful for edge level travel time or speed estimation. Also, penetration of GPS enabled vehicles/phones is very low in India to generate useful real time traffic information. In this simulation based study we use the map matching algorithm, proposed in [1], that operates on a series of position points having large location error to get accurate vehicle count for every edge, with time lag of about 10 minutes. Temporal extrapolation using exponential moving average is used to overcome the time lag. The vehicle count is then used to estimate edgewise vehicle flow and occupancy. Simulation results show the mean estimation error of less than 10%. Then, the edge level congestion estimation is done using volume-capacity ratio (V/C ratio) and mean error of less than 10% is observed. These results are encouraging as they show feasibility of using widely deployed cellular network for real time congestion level estimation. For edge level speed estimation, a subset of edges are chosen for infrastructure deployment using historical data of congestion levels observed on various edges in a road network. The edges with ITS infrastructure are used to learn the occupancy-speed relationship which is then spatially extrapolated to infrastructure-less edges using GPS probe data to enable travel speed estimation on all the edges in the road network. The simulation results show that speed estimation with ninety percentile error of less than 15% is achievable."
1702118,20178,369,Cell Edge Throughput Improvement by Base Station Cooperative Transmission Control with Reference Signal Interference Canceller in LTE System,2012,"Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) is attracting attention recently. This is a technique mainly improving cell-edge throughput by coordinating scheduling and signal transmission of multiple BSs. Different from joint transmission (JT), in which the desired signals for a user equipment (UE) are simultaneously transmitted from multiple BSs, the burdens of information exchange among BSs and its attendant signal processing are mitigated in ICIC because it requires only the exchange of scheduling and control information. In ICIC, the cell-edge throughput is improved by adaptively preventing BSs from transmitting signals (in other words, muting BSs) that would otherwise impose strong interference on the cell- edge UEs in the neighbor cells. Although this improves cell-edge throughput, it may degrade cell overall performance because no radio resource is assigned to UEs belonging to the muted BS. To resolve this issue, we first propose a scheduling method, which enables muting only when the throughput improvement (cell-edge UE) obtained by muting is superior to the total throughput possible without muting. Also, when considering applying this ICIC technique to current commercial systems such as LTE, it should be noted that reference signal, also known as pilot signal, is always transmitted regardless of muting because reference signal is a common signal used for channel estimation. To solve this issue, we also propose a reference signal interference canceller, in which the UE cancels the reference signal being transmitted from the neighbor BS. We evaluate the performance improvement by computer simulations and confirm that cell-edge throughput is dramatically improved by introducing the proposed canceller. We also propose a control algorithm that activates the canceller only when throughput improvement is possible. A basic lab experiment was also conducted to confirm the effect of the proposed interference canceller with 3GPP Rel-8 LTE-compliant equipment."
2502410,20178,369,High-Sensitivity Carrier Sensing Using Overlapped FFT for Cognitive Radio Transceivers,2009,"A noise suppression technique using overlapped FFT for carrier sensing of cognitive radio is proposed. The energy detection method is modified. A broadband signal is FFTed and the averaged power of each bin throughout the carrier-sensing period is calculated and judged against a threshold. At the process, adjacent FFT frames are overlapped greatly but with sufficiently large interval compared to the sample-by-sample sliding window. As a result, the averaging effect of noise increases and false alarm (FA) and misdetection (MD) probabilities are improved with much smaller computation amount than the sample-by-sample sliding window case. Simulations on FA and MD probabilities are performed and the effectiveness is confirmed. A model to explain the phenomenon using oversampling was introduced. In the case of energy detection, the detection probability increases when the threshold is lowered. However, this leads to increase of false alarm (FA) probability and throughput of the cognitive transceiver decreases. With higher threshold, although the throughput improves, misdetection (MD) probability increases and interference with the primary system rises. In this paper, we propose a high-sensitivity energy detection method when a wideband is A/D-converted at once and Fourier transformed into frequency bins using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The detected power in each bin is averaged across FFT frames. In the proposed method, FFT frames are defined such that adjacent frames overlap greatly with one another, and thermal noise is averaged more with this method. This technique can be considered a form of sliding window. In recent cognitive radio research, application of sliding window to energy detection was reported (7). In our technique, window interval is very long compared to the full sliding window case in which window is slid sample by sample. Although with full sliding window, noise averaging effect is maximized, the computation amount is very large. In this paper, we will clarify that sliding window with somewhat long window interval, in other words, greatly overlapped adjacent window, is sufficient considering the performance obtained. Dependencies of noise averaging effect on the window shape and overlapping rate are evaluated. The simulation results for FA and MD probability which indicate the effectiveness of the method are shown together with discussion illustrating the principle."
964943,20178,369,"Comparative Performance Study for Integrated 3G/WLAN Networks Using Mobile IP, SIP, and m-SCTP Protocols",2010,"The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has adopted an interworking architecture between Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). This architecture imposes a set of security requirements on subscribers connecting from within interworked WLANs to be able to access their 3G home packet-switched services. Providing seamless handoff and session continuity of ongoing communication is a critical task in UMTS/WLAN integrated networks. However, the 3GPP does not specify how mobility can be supported. This paper provides a performance evaluation for the three candidate solutions: Mobile IP (MIP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP) that may be used to provide session continuity in the integrated network. The vertical handoff delay figure is analyzed using simulations for different WLAN speeds and its major components due to the involved signaling procedures are quantified. The results are derived from our developed OPNET based simulation model that accounts for the detailed prescribed signaling procedures as per the related standards and Request for Comments (RFCs) documents, and the main network entities in the adopted architecture. The presented analysis provides insight into the potential performance bottlenecks in the integrated network. Major findings of the work show that the security related signaling and the signaling pertaining to obtaining a new Internet Protocol (IP) address, each contribute about 40% of the total delay for all the three solutions. Enhancements targeting these procedures will help reduce the overall delay while supporting seamless handoff between the two networks."
2508650,20178,369,Robust and High Data Rate Wireless Link for Security Between a Bus and a Control Centre,2007,"For transport operators today, making passengers and crews feel safer on urban mass transportation systems, and curbing damage to rolling-stock, are two of the main priorities. To satisfy these needs, they rely more and more on surveillance systems based on audio and video sensors which are able to detect automatically potentially dangerous situations and to send an alarm signal, with the corresponding audio and video streams, to the security staff at the control centre. When the system is embedded in a public transport vehicle, the transmission system must be a wireless one and must be able to offer high data rate and high quality of service in order not to cause a deterioration to the audio and video stream. The work presented in this paper concerns the development of such a transmission system from an urban bus to a control centre. Existing telecommunication standards offering large radio coverage generally offer asymmetrical links and none of them is able to support very high data rate in up-link. The new IEEE802.16 or WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) standard will offer 3 to 5 Mbps on both transmission directions. The paper will present a 2x4 MIMO transmission system based on the physical layer called PHY-OFDM of IEEE802.16-d with STBC code and turbo processing to increase robustness. Different signal processing solutions were evaluated in simulation with measured propagation channels with various correlation degrees (suburban and urban canyon) representative of urban bus environments. A real transmission system has been built on the basis of the simulation one. Experiments in real conditions were conducted in the centre of Lille in the north of France."
1977265,20178,369,Pulse Waveforms with a Correlation Criterion for Synthetic Aperture Imaging Systems,2009,"We introduce a method for the synthesis of pulse waveforms that possess a given time-bandwidth product, have narrow auto-correlation functions, and simultaneously, small cross-correlation functions. Pulse sets with such characteristics are desirable in various contexts in communications and rang- ing applications: the narrow auto-correlation property provides noise-immunity and enhances temporal resolution, while small cross-correlations minimize mutual interference in multiple- access systems. We leverage the energy concentration property of the prolate spheroidal wave functions to ensure small pair- wise cross-correlations, and develop an iterative algorithm that enforces a desired shape on the auto-correlation functions of the resulting waveforms. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated with examples: the correlation functions of the pulses that we obtain show significant improvements over those of PN sequences, and of pulses obtained by a previously reported method. I. INTRODUCTION The correlation properties of the signal waveforms are important in several aspects of radar, sonar, and commu- nications engineering. In ranging applications, for example, an auto-correlation function (ACF) with a narrow main-lobe and rapidly decaying side-lobes is necessary for adequate temporal resolution. In the context of digital communications, a well-localized ACF is beneficial to timing acquisition and synchronization, and multipath resolution in mobile fading environments. In systems where multiple signals share the same channel, their cross-correlation properties are equally im- portant, as signal discrimination and interference suppression techniques primarily rely on the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) being nearly zero. Examples of such multiple-access systems include CDMA communications, multiple-transmitter synthetic aperture imaging (SAI), etc.. In the following we denote the correlation function of the complex-valued signals si(t) ,s j(t) at lag τ by ri,j(τ ) as defined by the formula"
2309281,20178,369,Channel-Aware Quantization for Decentralized BLUE via Energy-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks,2009,"Bit assignment for local sensor data quantization in the decentralized best-linear-unbiased-estimation (BLUE) scenario is widely addressed in the signal processing research for wireless sensor networks. When the timely knowledge of the instantaneous sensor noise variance (for implementing the BLUE fusion rule) is too costly to obtain, one plausible alternative is to exploit the associated statistical characterization. Related such proposals, however, do not explicitly take into account the communication link impairments such as channel fading. In this paper we extend the current results to the more realistic case when signal transmission is subject to the fading effect. We show that the optimal bit allocation problem can be reformulated in the form of convex optimization, and then derive an analytical solution. Through numerical simulation the proposed solution is seen to outperform the uniform energy allocation scheme. instead optimize an associated tractable lower bound. It is shown that, even in the presence of channel fading, the problem can be formulated as convex optimization and is then analytically solved. Numerical simulation shows that, in the low-energy regime, the proposed method yields smaller average MSE, and at the same time achieves at least 10 % energy reduction, when compared with the uniform energy allocation scheme. In the high-energy case, even though the MSE performances of the two methods are roughly the same, the energy saving attained by the proposed method will be more than 60 %. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II is the preliminary. Section III shows that main analytical result and the related numerical study. Section IV briefly concludes this paper."
1978087,20178,369,Uplink Capacity with Correlated Lognormal Shadow Fading,2009,"In this paper we study the effect of Base Station (BS) and User Terminal (UT) shadowing correlation on the capacity of the Gaussian Cellular Multiple Access Channel. We also build a Monte Carlo simulator using realistic system parameters and distance dependent shadowing correlation estimation models. We are able to properly verify the theoretical analysis and we provide an insight on the maximum achievable capacity for real cellular systems. I. INTRODUCTION The first important attempt to study the information theo- retic capacity of a cellular system under the notion of global Base Station co-operation was carried out in the previous decade by Wyner in (1) and Somekh and Shamai in (2). They assumed a hyper-receiver with delay-less access to all sell- cite receivers, and a single-step path loss variability across the cells. Letzepis in (3) modified the one-dimensional version of Wyner's model to account for the interference caused not only from the two neighboring cells but from all cells in the system enabling the study of the effects of changing cell-density in the system. In (4) we removed the crude assumption that all users in a cell experience the same attenuation and we find the optimum capacity of a Wyner-like two dimensional model assuming that each cell-site receiver is receiving signals from 5 tiers of users. Up to now, there has not been reported any attempt to incor- porate shadow fading in Wyner's model. There are numerous results for the capacity of conventional wireless systems with shadow fading (5),(6). In (7) the authors derive the Shannon capacity of a single link channel under the effect of log- normal fading. Tse and Hanly in (8) derive the single-user delay limited capacity with shadow fading."
2482221,20178,369,On the Performance of Non-Coherent Transmission Schemes with Equal-Gain Combining in Correlated Generalized K-Fading,2009,"The generalized K-fading model, characterized by two parameters, k and m, was recently shown to accurately cap- ture the effects of composite shadowing and multipath fading in wireless communication systems. In this paper, we derive closed- form expressions for the bit error probability of two non-coherent transmission schemes over L diversity branches being subject to generalized K-fading. Specifically, focus is on binary differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and binary non-coherent frequency- shift keying (FSK) modulation with equal-gain combining at the receiver. We also derive expressions for the asymptotic diversity order, which reveal an interesting interplay between the two fading parameters k and m. Moreover, we show that the diversity order of the considered non-coherent transmission schemes is the same as in the case of coherent transmission. Finally, numerical performance results are presented, and our analytical results are corroborated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. as for low-cost receiver implementations. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the bit error probability (BEP) of two non-coherent transmission schemes over L generalized K-fading branches with (post-detection) equal- gain combining (EGC) at the receiver. Specifically, focus is on binary differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) modulation with conventional differential detection at the receiver (i.e., based on two subsequent received symbols) and orthogonal binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation with non-coherent detection at the receiver (9, Ch. 9.4). The L diversity branches could, for example, be created by multiple receive antennas. We also present a high-SNR analysis and provide expressions for the resulting asymptotic diversity order, which reveal an interesting interplay between the two fading parameters k and m. Concerning the K-fading model, we consider the scenario where the shadowing part is fully correlated across links, whereas the multipath fading is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across the L branches. Since shadowing represents a large-scale fading effect, it can be expected to affect all diversity branches simultaneously, while in a rich- scattering environment the multipath fading part can typically be considered independent across links, e.g., if the antenna"
2039815,20178,8228,Optimization of Wireless Multi-Source Multicast Ad-Hoc Networks Using Asymmetric Matrix Games,2010,"In this paper, we use matrix games framework for joint optimization of routing and network coding under conflict free scheduling for multi-source wireless ad-hoc networks. The impact of multicast diversity on scheduling is controlled by using topology compression concept quantified through compressed multicast topology matrix. To define topology matrix, first a set of all possible paths, including network coded paths, is identified and compressed. Depending on the nature of data selected path can be unicast or multicast. Then by switching between these paths with appropriate rates (frequencies), achievable scaled throughput is maximized. A link conflict free environment is designed by appropriate conflict free network partitioning using network graph coloring algorithm. For each possible coloring scheme and considering priority assigned to each source, link scheduling partitions topology matrix into multiple sub-matrices, one for each partial topologies. Each sub-matrix is used as a payoff matrix for an asymmetrical matrix game where against any single move of the second player, first player has multiple (K) moves, corresponding to different partial topologies or their equivalent colors. The strategy sets for the players are links and paths respectively. Such a game will be formally referred to as Asymmetrical Matrix Game with notation AMG(2,K,1) and the value of this game is inverse of the scaled throughput. In this notation 2 indicates two dimensional games. At the equilibrium, mixed strategy vector of the first player indicates optimum percentage of time or optimum number of time slots dedicated to the selected partial topologies for a given partitioning of the network graph while, mixed strategy vectors of the second player is proportional to optimum usage rates of the paths. Numerical results are presented for a simple butterfly network including 6 nodes and 2 sources. One source transmits multicast and second one unicast data with different priority."
552106,20178,369,Random Linear Network Coding Is Key to Data Survival in Highly Dynamic Distributed Storage,2015,"Distributed storage solutions have become widespread due to their ability to store large amounts of data reliably across a network of unreliable nodes, by employing repair mechanisms to prevent data loss. Conventional systems rely on static designs with a central control entity to oversee and control the repair process. Given the large costs for maintaining and cooling large data centers, our work proposes and studies the feasibility of a fully decentralized systems that can store data even on unreliable and, sometimes, unavailable mobile devices. This imposes new challenges on the design as the number of available nodes varies greatly over time and keeping track of the system's state becomes unfeasible. As a consequence, conventional erasure correction approaches are ill-suited for maintaining data integrity. In this highly dynamic context, random linear network coding (RLNC) provides an interesting solution. Our goal is to characterize RLNC's guaranteed data integrity region in terms of the total number of storage devices that need to be available and stored data per device. We compare our fully distributed RLNC approach to centralized (genie aided) and fully decentralized replication and Reed-Solomon mechanisms. Our results use traces from a BitTorrent client for Android devices to show that RLNC outperforms the next best scheme (fully centralized Reed-Solomon) not only by having a much lower probability of data loss, but by reducing storage requirements by up to 50% and reconstruction traffic by up to 40%. Gains over decentralized schemes are even larger."
2199710,20178,369,Functional Architecture of End-to-End Reconfigurable Systems,2006,"Adaptive networks are envisaged to play a significant part in the future, where the time and space variations in the traffic pattern will necessitate the ability to continuously amend the Radio Access Technologies' (RATs') operating parameters. Reconfiguration of communications systems is a facilitator towards this convergence and enables the dynamic adaptation and optimization of the access characteristics. However, such far ranging optimization concept involves many different mechanisms and work areas. Each of these areas provides an answer to a different optimization problem; Dynamic Network Planning and Management (DNPM) provides a load and demand driven optimization of the radio planning of multiple different networks within a given area. Advanced Spectrum Management (ASM) enables short term use of spectrum for services with higher demand. Finally Joint Radio Resource Management (JRRM) coordinates different access schemes and facilitates a more centralized approach to allocation of radio resource. Each of the schemes optimizes spectrum and radio resource usage on a different time scale. ARRM deals with the rather short term allocation, ASM with more medium term spectrum assignments while DNPM assumes time scales up to the range of weeks or months. Consequently, there is need of combining all working areas in the form of a Functional Architecture (FA), where each module represents a concept, aiming at forming part of the global end-to-end reconfigurability architecture. This paper includes a detailed analysis of the Reconfigurability FA, along with a description of the functionality of each of the modules included therein."
1334283,20178,369,Multi-User Detection in Multibeam Mobile Satellite Systems: A Fair Performance Evaluation,2013,"Multi-User Detection (MUD) techniques are currently being examined as promising technologies for the next generation of broadband, interactive, multibeam satellite communication (SatCom) systems. Results in the existing literature have shown that when full frequency and polarization reuse is employed and user signals are jointly processed at the gateway, more than threefold gains in terms of spectral efficiency over conventional systems can be obtained. However, the information theoretic results for the capacity of the multibeam satellite channel are given under ideal assumptions, disregarding the implementation constraints of such an approach. Considering a real system implementation, the adoption of full resource reuse is bound to increase the payload complexity and power consumption. Since these novel techniques require extra payload resources, fairness issues in the comparison among the two approaches arise. The present contribution evaluates in a fair manner, the performance of the return link (RL) of a SatCom system serving mobile users that are jointly decoded at the receiver. In this context, the throughput performance of the assumed system is compared to that of a conventional one, under the constraint of equal physical layer resource utilization; thus the comparison can be regarded as fair. Results show, that even when systems operate under the same payload requirements as the conventional systems, a significant gain can be realized, especially in the high SNR region. Finally, existing analytical formulas are also employed to provide closed form descriptions of the performance of clustered systems, thus introducing insights on how the performance scales with respect to the system parameters."
2549797,20178,369,Opportunistic Scheduling and Adaptive Modulation in Wireless Networks with Network Coding,2009,"So far, many researches on network coding are performed with higher layer protocols such as MAC, routing, and flow control protocols without consideration of physical layer issues such as channel conditions of links. However, in wireless networks, the consideration of properties at the physical layer is important to improve system performance. Hence, in this paper, we study an opportunistic scheduling and adaptive modulation problem for wireless networks with network coding, which is a joint problem for MAC and physical layers. A similar problem was studied in (1) considering an idealized system in which the data rate of each link is modeled with the Shannon capacity. They showed that to maximize the throughput of a transmission, the optimal subset of native packets that are encoded within a coded packet should be selected based on the channel condition at the destination for each native packet. Moreover, they also showed that it may not be the optimal selection to encode all possible native packets within a coded packet. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model than that of (1) with practical modulation schemes such as M-PSK and MQAM. We show that the optimal policy that maximizes the throughput of a transmission is to encode all available native packets within a coded packet regardless of the channel condition at the destination for each native packet, which is a different conclusion from that of (1). However, we show that adaptive modulation, in which its constellation size in a coded packet is adjusted based on the channel condition of each destination node, provides a higher throughput than the scheme with fixed modulation, in which its constellation size is always fixed regardless of the channel condition at each destination node. Index Terms—Wireless networks, Network coding, Scheduling, Adaptive modulation. I. INTRODUCTION Since the publication by Ahlswede et. al. (2), network coding has emerged as a promising solution to achieve higher throughput in both wireline and wireless networks. In the traditional network without network coding, a node forwards packets that it received to the appropriate next hop node without any processing in the information part of the packet. However, in the network with network coding, a node forwards coded packets produced by performing some processing with several packets that it has already received. Even though network coding requires coding and decoding processes ad- ditionally in each node in the network, it has been shown"
2266033,20178,369,Implications of Fairness Criteria on the Techno-Economic Viability of Relaying Networks,2009,"The introduction of relaying techniques into cellular networks is expected to reduce the total infrastructure cost, especially when coverage extension is sought. With the advent of networks such as LTE, guaranteeing high data-rate coverage may become a challenge even for incumbent operators which nowadays provide full coverage for voice service. However it is not straightforward that operators will be able (or want) to guarantee coverage for the high data-rates. In this paper we study how the techno-economic viability of the relaying solution depends on the type of service to be provided by the operator. We exemplify the trade off between coverage and system throughput with two fairness criteria: perfect fairness (coverage guarantee) and proportional fairness. We show that relays provide advantages when the operator is interested in providing bit-rate/QoS guarantees. When maximizing the system throughput or cell capacity, relays are of less value. I. INTRODUCTION The deployment of wireless broadband access systems, required to meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand, involves a number of intricate resource management problems. The objective is to provide a certain desired service level to the users at the lowest possible infrastructure cost. Usually one distinguishes between the network dimensioning problem (i.e. the selection of how many access points, which kind of equipment should be deployed where and when) and the resource allocation problem (i.e. how to divide the radio resources of an already deployed network among the users). The solution to both problems depends on what kind of service the operator intends to provide to the users, e.g. whether coverage guarantees should be given or not. The dimensioning problem is closely related to the financial"
2990285,20178,369,Performance Evaluation of MISO-SDMA in Heterogeneous Networks with Practical Cell Association,2016,"In this paper adopting stochastic geometry we investigate the system performance in heterogenous networks including multiple tiers of BSs with multiple-input single output spatial division multiple access (MISO-SDMA) technique. In the related literature on heterogenous systems, ideal cell association (CA) rules are often considered for simplicity, where each user equipment (UE) examines a very large number of pilots across the tiers before choosing its associated base station (BS). Here we consider practical cases where UEs are restricted to examine $K_H \geq 1$ pilots across all tiers before choosing their associated BS. We then obtain closed-form expressions for the system performance measured by the coverage probability and UE's data rate. Our analytical results provide quantitative insights on the impact of different factors on the system performance including the BS's spatial density, their transmission powers, number of transmit antennas, SIR thresholds, number of UEs served by each BS, and $K_H$. Interestingly, we observe that increasing $K_H$ always improves the coverage probability however, it only improves data rate up to a certain point. The data rate is then reduced by further increasing of $K_H$. Given $K_H$ pilots in practical cases, the issue is how to allocate the pilots among different tiers. We address this issue by developing an algorithm and show that by careful allocation of available pilots, the network performance is significantly improved even in cases with small $K_H$. Our results also indicate a fundamental tradeoff, as sharing strategies providing the best coverage performance yield very poor capacity and vice versa. Such trade-off provides a new degree of freedom in heterogeneous networks design."
2000854,20178,369,Comparison of Relaying Strategies for Cooperative Diversity Systems with Adaptive Modulation,2009,"In this paper, we propose several relay selection schemes for cooperative diversity systems with adaptive trans- mission. The proposed schemes are based on dual-hop relaying with multiple relays. We analyze the performance of the proposed schemes by quantifying the average spectral efficiency and the outage probability. We also investigate the tradeoff of perfor- mance and complexity among proposed schemes by evaluating the average number of active relays, path estimations, and signal- to-noise ratio comparisons. Our proposed schemes and analysis are also applicable to single relay systems with multiple antennas. the tradeoff involved in such relay systems by examining the performance and the complexity of several relay selection strategies. We consider a two-hop relay system with adaptive transmission. The relays perform decode and forward type of relaying and to ensure that the instantaneous error rate performance of both hops are satisfactory, the transmission mode is selected based on the quality of the worst hop. For the resulting system, we study the performance mea- sures, such as the average spectral efficiency, the outage probability, and other complexity measures, including the average number of active relays, the average number of path estimations, and the average number of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparisons, of the three different relay selection schemes through analysis whenever feasible in a simple fash- ion. Several selected numerical examples are presented and discussed to illustrate the advantage of different relay selection schemes. We observe that the performance of relay system can considerably benefit from more active relays at the cost of additional complexity of relay selection and coordination. We would like to note that while this paper is presented in the context of multiple relays selection while assuming that high- speed links exists between relays for information exchange and coordination, the formulation and analysis can also apply to the scenario of antenna subset selection at a multiple-antenna relay (8). In this case, saving in terms of the average number of active relays will be equivalent to saving in terms of the active antennas/RF chains in the relay, which implies the reduction in the processing power at the relay."
1190217,20178,369,Channel Quality Indicator Preamble for Discontinuous Reception,2010,"This paper proposes a potential enhancement for Discontinuous Reception (DRX) operation in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. In Third Generation Partnership Project's (3GPP's) Release 8 it is specified that User Equipment (UE) may be configured with DRX which controls the UE's Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) monitoring activity. By allowing discontinuous monitoring of PDCCH the UE can switch its receiver circuitry on and off for battery saving purposes. However, if UE turns its receiver circuitry off it is not capable to neither perform nor send any Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) measurements to the network prior to 'on-duration' (i.e., activity) period. This means that the Evolved Node B (e- Node B) might not have accurate CQI information and the scheduling and resource allocation could be based on outdated CQI information. To avoid reduced performance caused by the out-of-date information, this paper evaluates a scheme where a CQI preamble period is introduced prior to the actual 'on duration' time. During the preamble period UE measures the CQI and sends the measurement result to the e-Node B. The performance of the scheme is evaluated together with Voice over IP (VoIP) service. Used tool is a dynamic system level simulator which enables detailed simulation of users in multiple cells with realistic call generation, propagation, fading and mobility models. In addition to VoIP performance the UE power consumption is also evaluated with a simple model. This paper concludes that the preamble scheme can lead to improved performance in terms of VoIP capacity, and that the improvements can be achieved with acceptable trade-off in terms of battery saving opportunities"
2417899,20178,369,A shape-independent method for pedestrian detection with far-infrared images,2004,"Nighttime driving is more dangerous than daytime driving-particularly for senior drivers. Three to four times as many driving-related deaths occur at night than in the daytime. To improve the safety of night driving, automatic pedestrian detection based on infrared images has drawn increased attention because pedestrians tend to stand out more against the background in infrared images than they do in visible light images. Nevertheless, pedestrian detection in infrared images is by no means trivial-many of the known difficulties carry over from visible light images, such as image variability occasioned by pedestrians being in different poses. Typically, several different pedestrian templates have to be used in order to deal with a range of poses. Furthermore, pedestrian detection is difficult because of poor infrared image quality (low resolution, low contrast, few distinguishable feature points, little texture information, etc.) and misleading signals. To address these problems, this paper introduces a shape-independent pedestrian-detection method. Our segmentation algorithm first estimates pedestrians' horizontal locations through projection-based horizontal segmentation and then determines pedestrians' vertical locations through brightness/bodyline-based vertical segmentation. Our classification method defines multidimensional histogram-, inertia-, and contrast-based classification features. The features are shape-independent, complementary to one another, and capture the statistical similarities of image patches containing pedestrians with different poses. Thus, our pedestrian-detection system needs only one pedestrian template-corresponding to a generic walking pose-and avoids brute-force searching for pedestrians throughout whole images, which typically involves brightness-similarity comparisons between candidate image patches and a multiplicity of pedestrian templates. Our pedestrian-detection system is neither based on tracking nor does it depend on camera calibration to determine the relationship between an object's height and its vertical image locations. Thus, it is less restricted in applicability. Even if much work is still needed to bridge the gap between present pedestrian-detection performance and the high reliability required for real-world applications, our pedestrian-detection system is straightforward and provides encouraging results in improving speed, reliability, and simplicity."
481863,20178,369,Extending the LTE-Sim Simulator with Multi-Band Scheduling Algorithms for Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced Scenarios,2015,"Carrier Aggregation (CA) has been proposed by 3GPP LTE-Advanced to meet or even exceed IMT-Advanced systems enhanced peak data rates requirements. In its rationale, multiple Component Carriers (CC) can be flexibly aggregated so that user equipment can access a total bandwidth of up to 100 MHz. As each CC has the same structure as the one from LTE R8, CA does not require notable changes in the LTE physical layer structure. Nevertheless, the way radio resources are allocated to mobile users in CA scenarios is still an hot research topic and the availability of an open source tool modelling such kind of feature is highly demanded in both academia and industry contexts. The present contribution is three-folded. First, it presents an open source and freeware extension of the well-known LTE-Sim simulator, which implements CA functionalities. Second, it also proposes an implementation of multi-band scheduling strategies able to optimally distribute radio resource among mobile users in the presence of multiple CCs and strict Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Third, computer simulations have been also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aforementioned contributions. In particular, simulation results show the capacity improvements achieved by the proposed Enhanced Multi Scheduler against systems without CA, considering values of the bandwidth per component carrier of 5 and 20 MHz, in terms of average cell packet loss, delay, goodput and spectral efficiency."
3107200,20178,369,Location Based Beamforming in 5G Ultra-Dense Networks,2016,"In this paper we consider transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) beamforming schemes based on the location of the device. In particular, we propose a design methodology for the Tx/Rx beamforming weight-vectors that is based on the departure and arrival angles of the line-of sight (LoS) path between accessnodes (ANds) and user-nodes (UNds). A network-centric extended Kalman filter (EKF) is also proposed for estimating and tracking the directional parameters needed for designing the Tx and Rx beamforming weights. The proposed approach is particularly useful in 5G ultra-dense networks (UDNs) since the high-probability of LoS condition makes it possible to design geometric beams at both Tx and Rx in order to increase the signal-to-interferenceplus- noise ratio (SINR). Moreover, relying on the location of the UNd relative to the ANds makes it possible to replace fullband uplink (UL) reference signals, commonly employed for acquiring the channel-state- information-at-transmitter (CSIT) in time- division-duplex (TDD) systems, by narrowband UL pilots. Also, employing the EKF for tracking the double-directional parameters of the LoS-path allows one to reduce the rate at which UL reference signals are transmitted. Consequently, savings in terms of time frequency resources are achieved compared to beamforming schemes based on full-band CSI. Extensive numerical results are included using a realistic ray-tracing based system-level simulator in ultra-dense 5G network context. Results show that position based beamforming schemes outperform those based on full-band CSI in terms of mean user-throughput even for highly mobile users."
1861375,20178,369,A new approach to performance evaluation of generalized selection diversity receivers in wireless channels,2001,"Motivated by potential applications to wideband cellular DS-CDMA and millimeter-wave communications, the study of the generalized selection combining (GSC) receiver that adaptively combines a subset of M strongest paths out of L available paths has intensified over the past few years. The study of the GSC(M, L) receiver is also important from a theoretical standpoint because this model encapsulates both the classical selection combining receiver and the maximal-ratio combining receiver as limiting cases. Despite its importance, published results on GSC(M, L) receiver performance in a generalized fading channel are still very limited, mainly due to the mathematical difficulty encountered while computing the first-order statistics of a linear sum of ordered random variables. This paper provides a partial solution to the problem on hand by deriving relatively simple-to-evaluate expressions for the moment generating function (MGF) of GSC output SNR in a variety of fading environments given that the individual branch SNRs are independent and identically distributed. Moreover, our generic single integral expression for the MGF of GSC output SNR reduces to a closed-form formula if the branch amplitudes follow either Rayleigh or Nakagami-m (positive integer fading index) distribution. An easily programmable recursive solution of the MGF in Nakagami-m channels is also provided. Our expressions hold for any M and L values, and thus facilitate a comprehensive analysis of GSC systems including the average symbol error probability (ASEP) analysis of a broad class of binary and M-ary modulations, average combined SNR and the outage rate of error probability analysis."
1865183,20178,369,Joint Application of Spread Spectrum and OFDM Modulation for Microwave Radio Communication Used for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,2011,"The wireless communication system used by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle has special requirements. Two separate data streams are used, one for telemetry and control of the vehicle, and one for payload. The first stream is of relatively low data rate, but must be very robust. The second stream requires high data rate, but a best effort approach is acceptable. Real-time remote control usage mandates low response time (turn around latency) of the system, which demands small frames and frequent direction changes over the half duplex channel. These two different requirements must be accounted for in the design of the modulation system. In this paper our solution based on the joint application of a chirp spread spectrum modulation with a correlator based demodulator for the telemetry and control data stream and a high data rate orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation for the payload is presented. The OFDM communication occupies the same bandwidth as the spread spectrum modulation, but - unlike the Chirp signal - utilizes its full bandwidth. By using a correlation detector for all timing recovery tasks and keeping the same timing for the OFDM part of the frame, all control loops normally needed for this task (symbol synchronization PLL, COSTAS loop) can be eliminated. This results in the whole signal processing path being a finite impulse response system which aids us in a highly pipelineable design implementation and makes it possible to create a high speed implementation with a low-end field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit."
1151742,20178,10192,Measuring the Impact of the Mobile Radio Channel on the Energy Efficiency of LTE User Equipment,2012,"The energy that has to be spent for the successful submission of one Bit is an important figure of merit for the performance analysis and optimization of modern wireless communication systems. The many factors which are influencing this performance parameter range from the efficiency of the User Equipment's (UE) power amplifier to the average path loss, the Transmit Power Control (TPC) parametrization and the fading characteristics of the radio channel. Although many of the relationships can be analytically modeled, the aim of this paper is to present reliable measurements based on commercially available Long Term Evolution (LTE) hardware. Therefore, extensive User Datagram Protocol (UDP) data rate measurements have been performed in a mobile communications laboratory for different radio channel conditions. The impact of the mobile fading channel was emulated by a sophisticated radio channel emulator. Beside this, the on average consumed power of the LTE UE was measured during data transmission. From the results of these measurements, quantitative figures on the energy efficiency are presented for different LTE frequency bands and different radio channels. The results show that major energy savings are possible if the 800 MHz frequency band, which becomes available as part of the digital dividend, can be used for user with bad channel conditions. Considering energy efficiency as a Quality of Service (QoS) parameter of increasing importance the results presented in this paper allow for a context sensitive optimization in a way that the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) switching points as well as the frequency band are chosen with respect to the UE's condition."
1018193,20178,369,An Efficient Reduced-Complexity Two-Stage Differential Sliding Correlation Approach for OFDM Synchronization in the AWGN Channel,2011,"In this paper, we propose a new scheme for data- aided time and frequency synchronization for OFDM systems, based on a single-symbol preamble. The preamble, of useful length $2^{m}-2$, is composed of two consecutive identical m-sequences (with length $2^{m-1}-1$ each). This preamble is extended by a cyclic prefix of convenient length. This stucture is adequate for a two-stage synchronization scheme, namely a reduced complexity coarse synchronization stage, followed by a finer synchronization one. The first stage, based on Cox and Schmidl-like sliding correlation, determines a reduced uncertainty interval over which the fine stage is carried. The second stage is indeed based on a differential correlation, which is more complex compared to the first stage. The combined use of m-sequences and differential correlation offers an almost perfect peak of the computed metric at the preamble start. To assess the performance degradation occasioned by the reduction of complexity characterizing the proposed two-stage approach, we also consider the brute force single-stage approach, where differential correlation is exclusively used. As a byproduct of our two-stage approach, the fractional frequency offset is estimated and its performance is assessed and compared for both two- stage and one-stage approaches. The brute force approach outperfoms all the considered benchmarks. Compared to the reduced complexity scheme, the brute force one provides similar performance, at the expense of a significant complexity overload. Only for SNR lower than $-5$ dB, the brute force scheme presents a slight enhancement with respect to the reduced complexity one. The simulation results show that the proposed method gives better performance than any other considered estimator. Although our technique is expected to be well suited to multipath channels, thanks to the underlying properties of m-sequences, in this paper we focus on the Additive White Gaussian Noise channel."
1683909,20178,369,Efficient IP Mobility Management for Green Optical and Wireless Converged Access Networks,2012,"- During off-peak hours of a day, when incoming and outgoing traffic arrival rate used to be low, a Mobile Terminal (MT) can stay in idle mode for long time. For tracking the idle MTs, a wireless access network invokes them to conduct location update whenever they enter into a new location. This allows the network to route a call successfully. To provide any IP packet based service, Mobile IP (MIP) is very important protocol undeniably. However, Proxy Mobile IP was developed by IETF without considering idle mode condition of MTs. Consequently, an idle MT needs to conduct MIP binding (Layer 3 location update) whenever it moves to a new area of a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) although it does not have any incoming or outgoing packets during idle periods. This phenomenon unnecessarily increases location update signaling cost. In our previous work, we proposed a mechanism using which only Layer 2 location update is needed when an MT is in idle mode and the Layer 3 location update is conducted after a call arrives for an idle MT in Optical and Wireless Converged Access Networks (OWCAN). This allows saving energy in the mobility management nodes (e.g. MAG, Base Stations) significantly. Based on our previous work, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the Optical Network Units (ONUs) of an OWCAN. This algorithm decides when to interrupt modules of a sleeping ONU to wake up and which frames should be forwarded for uplink transmission. We have found that adopting this algorithm an ONU of an OWCAN can save energy significantly. Therefore, our solutions mainly contribute in two-fold to make a green OWCAN. First, it minimizes energy consumption in the mobility management nodes. Second, our solution also reduces energy consumption and improves bandwidth utilization in the optical backhaul."
2158099,20178,369,Improved Vehicle Navigation Using Aiding with Tightly Coupled Integration,2008,"Vehicle navigation poses difficulties as it requires the uninterrupted availability of accurate positioning information, even in circumstances without an ideal condition. Global Positioning System (GPS) provides consistently accurate positioning solutions if four or more GPS satellites can be observed. Unfortunately, this condition is usually not satisfied if a vehicle is going through urban canyon, tunnel or forest canopy. Even with High Sensitivity and Assisted GPS receivers, reliable positioning using GPS alone in difficult urban situations is still a challenge. Inertial Navigation System (INS), consists of self- contained sensors that can continuously provide accurate short term positioning solutions. The integration of GPS and INS can overcome the GPS drawback and provide continuous navigation solutions even during GPS signal outages. Though newly developed MEMS-based INS sensors have relatively low accuracy, they are compact and inexpensive, which is very suitable for vehicle navigation. Hence, there is a growing interest in exploring the capabilities of these sensors in the field of vehicle navigation. This paper presents the integration of GPS with MEMS-based INS in a tightly coupled scheme. Tightly coupled integration can make use of GPS signals even if less than four GPS satellites are observed. Thus it offers better integration options. To further improve the GPS/INS integration results, non- holonomic constraints and heading observations were used in this study to improve the online positioning accuracies. The results showed the drift errors could be significantly reduced when non- holonomic constraints and/or heading information were used, during periods with GPS signal outage. In addition, a backward smoother called Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) was also implemented for offline processing needs purpose. The integration results showed that the RTS smoother can significantly reduce the drift errors even if neither non-holonomic constraints nor heading information were used."
2137650,20178,369,EXIT Chart Analysis of Low-Complexity Bayesian Turbo Multiuser Detection for Rank-Deficient Multiple Antenna Aided OFDM,2007,"This paper studies the mutual information transfer characteristics of a novel low-complexity Bayesian Multiuser Detector (MUD) proposed for employment in Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) aided Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The design of the Bayesian MUD advocated is based on extending the optimum single-user Bayesian design to multiuser OFDM signals modeled by a Gaussian mixture, rather than by a single Gaussian distribution, when characterizing the conditional PDF of the received signal. In order to reduce the complexity of the Bayesian MUD, we introduce an a priori information threshold and then discard the low- probability terms during the calculation of the extrinsic information generated . The achievable complexity reduction as a function of different threshold values is analyzed and the best tradeoff values are derived with the aid of simulation. Both non-systematic and recursive systematic convolutional codes are used for exchanging extrinsic information with the MUD for the sake of achieving a turbo-detection aided iteration gain. The convergence behavior of the proposed low-complexity Bayesian turbo MUD is investigated using Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and compared to that of Soft Interference Cancellation aided Minimum Mean Square Error (SIC-MMSE) MUD schemes. As expected, the simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity Bayesian Turbo MUD outperforms the SIC-MMSE MUDs. A substantial benefit of the proposed MUD is that it is potentially capable of supporting up to three times higher number of users than the number of receiver antennas. In this challenging multiuser scenario, the resultant channel- matrix becomes rank-deficient, resulting in a linearly non-separable detector output phasor constellation, when classic linear receivers tend to exhibit a poor performance."
1198290,20178,369,Multi-BS Cooperative Interference Control for LTE Systems,2012,"Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) is attracting attention recently. In ICIC, cell-edge throughput can be improved by preventing BSs from transmitting signals (hereafter, muting BSs), and the information exchange among BSs is little because each UE is only served by a BS at any instant. However, when a BS is muted, no radio resource is allocated to UEs belonging to the muted BS while UEs belonging to other BSs enjoy high cell-edge throughput. Therefore, there is a possibility that overall cell performance may degrade. To prevent this, we propose a multi-BS cooperative interference control method. The basic concept of the proposed method is that the muting is triggered only when the total throughput of the cooperation area is increased by the muting compared to the total throughput possible without muting. The proposed method makes it possible to increase cell-edge throughput without degrading overall cell performance. We also propose a way to realize this interference control on practical systems. First, we propose a way to realized it on 3GPP Release 8 LTE systems. In the proposed interference control, it is important to estimate throughput (SINR) values with and without muting appropriately. We propose to utilize feedback signals defined in LTE such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) and Received Signal Received Power (RSRP) to achieve the accurate throughput estimation. Furthermore, we propose to realize the proposed interference control on a distributed sector configuration using optical fiber systems such as Radio over Fiber (RoF) or Remote Radio Head (RRH). With this configuration, it is possible to achieve ICIC with less burden of information exchange. Especially with three sector configuration, it is possible to achieve inter-cell cooperation with inter-sector cooperation, which can be easily implemented."
2674673,20178,8228,Enhanced effective SNR prediction for LTE downlink,2015,"The performance of long term evolution (LTE) system can be improved by optimizing the downlink channel allocation, while the optimization demands the channel quality indicator (CQI) fed back by the user equipment(UE). However, since the channel is time-varying and there exists CQI feedback delay T, the feedback CQI can't always represent the UE's current channel state, leading to the sub-optimal allocation performance. In this paper, we propose to apply the wavelet transform-support vector machine (WT-SVM) method to predict the current effective signal to noise ratio (effective SNR) and its mapping CQI. We firstly study and confirm the chaotic behavior of effective SNR. Then the WT is used to decompose the effective SNR time series and C-C method is adopted to reconstruct the phase space of components decomposed from that series. After selecting the penalty parameter and kernel function coefficient by particle swarm optimization (PSO), we can predict the effective SNR by SVM. The simulations are then performed, and the estimate precision of our presented scheme is compared with that of three available methods, including the history information predicting, autoregression and back propagation neural network. Finally, the CQI mapped from predicted effective SNR are used for the downlink channel allocation in Vienna LTE Simulator to verify the effectiveness of our presented scheme in improving throughput and decreasing block error rate (BLER). The results demonstrate that WT-SVM has the minimum prediction error. Consequently, the WT-SVM based system can improve the average throughput by 10.84% and decrease the average BLER by 30.66% when T = 5 TTIs, relative to the history information predicting."
814759,20178,8228,Receive antenna shift keying for time reversal wireless communications,2012,"Wireless communication systems based on Time Reversal (TR) and a Single Tap Receiver (STR) are optimum at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), while keeping low complexity at the receiver. Thus, they are interesting for low order Phase and Amplitude Modulations, such as Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). However, at higher Signal to Noise Ratio, Inter-Symbol Interference prevents from using higher order modulations such as 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16QAM) or 64QAM. This paper presents a new spatial modulation technique called Received Antenna Shift Keying (RASK), enabling the use of higher order modulation with TR and STR. Information is not conveyed by Phase and Amplitude Modulation (PAM). Instead, at the transmitter side, Time Reversal pre-filtering technique is used to focus a signal with constant amplitude and phase onto a single receive antenna among several receive antennas. Every symbol duration, the transmitter updates the target receive antenna. The index of the antenna is simply equal to the integer value coded by the binary sequence of information that has to be transmitted during the considered symbol. At the receiver side, each antenna has a Single Tap Receiver. The output of the Single Tap Receivers are used by a simple detector to determine the target receive antenna among all antennas. The detected antenna index is then converted into a binary sequence. If N is the number of receive antennas, a N-RASK system transmits Log 2 (N) bits per symbol. The performance of 16RASK is compared to 16QAM, with Time Reversal, and 1 bit Time Reversal, using simulations modeling inter-symbol and un-perfect spatial focusing. The study shows that 16RASK outperforms 16QAM, under strong multipath or when the number of transmit antennas is high."

Such models enable first optimal single-standard power-throughput trade-offs, that will be used as reference points before adding the handover possibility in order to assess its specific gain.#R##N##R##N#The second step is the design of a handover controller that selects the network with the lowest expected power for the required rate. The proposed mechanism is based on regular scanning of both networks. It computes the expected energy in order to send a given amount of data over each network, taking handover cost into account, and selects the most appropriate one.#R##N##R##N#Based on a software-defined radio platform and a typical channel coherence time of one second, simulations demonstrate a power saving factor up to 2.5 as a function of the scenario, compared to a single-standard system that is already cross-layer optimized. This illustrates the large gain that is available, besides the handover advantage in terms of improved connectivity."
2258024,20178,369,Optimal downlink space-time scheduling design with convex utility functions-multiple-antenna systems with orthogonal spatial multiplexing,2005,"It is well known that link level throughput could be significantly increased by using multiple antennae at the transmitter and receiver without increasing the bandwidth and power budget. However, optimizing the link level performance of multiple-antenna systems does not always imply achieving system level optimization. Therefore, cross-layer optimization across the link layer and the scheduling layer is very important to fully exploit the temporal and spatial dimensions of the communication channel. In this paper, we consider the optimal downlink space-time scheduling design for a general class of convex utility functions. The access point or base station is equipped with n/sub T/ transmit antennas. There are K mobiles in the system with a single receive antenna. For practical reasons, we assume zero-forcing processing at the physical layer of the base station and mobile. We will apply the design framework to two common utility functions, namely the maximum throughput and the proportional fair. The cross-layer scheduling design is a mixed convex and combinatorial optimization problem and the search space of the optimal solution is enormous. Greedy algorithm, which has been widely used in today's wireless data systems (3G1X, high data rate system (HDR), Universal Mobile Terrestrial Service), is optimal when n/sub T/=1. However, we found that there is a large performance penalty of greedy algorithms (relative to optimal performance) when n/sub T/>1 and this motivates the search for more efficient heuristics. In this paper, we will address genetic-based heuristics and discuss their complexity-performance tradeoff."
2514451,20178,369,Angular power distribution and mean effective gain of mobile antenna in different propagation environments,2002,"We measured the elevation angle distribution and cross-polarization power ratio of the incident power at a mobile station in different radio propagation environments at 2.15 GHz frequency. A novel measurement technique was utilized, based on a wideband channel sounder and a spherical dual-polarized antenna array at the receiver. Data were collected over 9 km of continuous measurement routes, both indoor and outdoor. Our results show that in non-line-of-sight situations, the power distribution in elevation has a shape of a double-sided exponential function, with different slopes on the negative and positive sides of the peak. The slopes and the peak elevation angle depend on the environment and base-station antenna height. The cross-polarization power ratio varied within 6.6 and 11.4 dB, being lowest for indoor and highest for urban microcell environments. We applied the experimental data for analysis of the mean effective gain (MEG) of several mobile handset antenna configurations, with and without the user's head. The obtained MEG values varied from approximately -5 dBi in free space to less than -11 dBi beside the head model. These values are considerably lower than what is typically used in system specifications. The result shows that considering only the maximum gain or total efficiency of the antenna is not enough to describe its performance in practical operating conditions. For most antennas, the environment type has little effect on the MEG, but clear differences exist between antennas. The effect of the user's head on the MEG depends on the antenna type and on which side of the head the user holds the handset."
2308301,20178,369,Performance Measures of Automatic Frequency Control Corrupted by Interference and Fading in Dual Dissimilar Channels,2009,"The mean time to loss of lock and the average switching rate of an automatic frequency control (AFC) loop are derived in this paper for the case of two received signals in dis- similar fading channels. The general case of modulated carriers is considered while the results are also applicable to unmodulated carriers. The channels are assumed to have Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami-m distributions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effect of these fading scenarios on the performance of an AFC in the presence of cochannel interference. In digital receivers, automatic frequency control loops are employed to recover and control the frequency of received signals. They may be used as an independent and necessary part of the receiver (in noncoherent receivers) or they may be used as an acquisition aid to improve the performance of a phase-locked loop (PLL) (1). The basic components of an AFC are shown in (1, Fig. 8.3-2). The frequency detector (FD) produces an error voltage which is proportional to the difference between an input signal's carrier frequency and the local frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). This error voltage is filtered by the loop filter and then is used to control the local frequency of the VCO. When the local frequency of the VCO equals the carrier frequency of the input signal, the error voltage is equal to zero and the AFC is in steady state. The performance of an AFC in a noisy environment has been investigated for a single received signal in various references. In (2)-(5), the variance of the frequency error has been used as a measure of the tracking performance of an AFC and in (6) and (7), the probability of loss of lock of an AFC due to the effect of noise has been employed to evaluate the performance. However, noise is not the only disturbance that can affect the performance of an AFC. Since there are several users in a wireless channel, the presence of more than one signal at the input of a receiver is commonplace. This issue has been investigated in (8) for a single interferer and it has been shown that the AFC will remain locked on the desired signal until the amplitude of the interferer exceeds the amplitude of the desired signal."
1714509,20178,369,Word-of-Mouth in Radio Access Markets,2006,"Opening up interoperability between wide and local area networks seems to be a very promising solution for delivering improved user experience while reducing overall service costs. In a scenario, where a single operator owns different types of networks, QoS provision can be achieved by introducing complex multi-system resource management. On the contrary, if local area networks are deployed by different entities, due to the lack of both coordination and centralized RRM management, the experienced QoS may drastically fluctuate, ranging from SLAs in wide area, to only best effort expectations in local area networks. In order for nomadic terminal agents to perform informed access selection decisions, we propose the adoption of Word-of-Mouth (WoM), a novel scheme for sharing, in a peer-to-peer fashion, information about the service quality experienced with different networks. The performances of our proposed WoM scheme have been evaluated for a file pre-fetching service, considering information characterized by various degrees of time criticality, when different RRM strategies are implemented in the local area networks. The results show that if a critical mass of terminal agents exchange experienced QoS information, the overall network selection decision is improved: terminal agents can estimate, on beforehand, which type of performances to expect with different candidate networks, and avoid to select those not satisfying service requirements. This, in turn brings two main positive effects: on one hand, user perceived performance is improved, and, on the other hand, the adoption of RRM strategies providing some degree QoS is incentivated."
922204,20178,369,On the Effect of Gaussian Imperfect Channel Estimations on the Performance of Space Modulation Techniques,2012,"Space modulation techniques, such as spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK), are efficient lowcomplexity implementation of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. In such techniques, a single transmit-antenna is activated during each time instant and the activated antenna index is used to convey information. Due to the novel method of conveying information, a major criticism arises on the practicality of such techniques in the presence of real-time imperfections such as channel estimation errors. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to shed light on this issue. The performance of such systems are analyzed in the presence of Gaussian imperfect channel estimations. More specifically, the performance of SSK system consisting of Nt transmit and Nr receive antennas with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver is studied. The exact average bit error probability (ABEP) over Rayleigh fading channels is obtained in closed-form for Nt = 2 and arbitrary Nr; while union upper bound is used to compute the ABEP when Nt > 2 and arbitrary Nr. Furthermore, simple and general asymptotic expression for the ABEP is derived and analyzed. Besides, the effect of imperfect CSI on the performance of SM, Alamouti and SSK schemes considering different number of channel estimation pilots are studied and compared via numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that, on the contrary to the raised criticism, space modulation techniques are more robust to channel estimation errors than Alamouti since the probability of error is determined by the differences between channels associated with the different transmit antennas rather than the actual channel realization."
1679436,20178,369,Blind Maximum Likelihood Interference Mitigation for PDCCH of 3GPP LTE/LTE-A,2014,"The performance of the downlink physical channels of 3GPP LTE/LTE-A system is typically limited by co-channel interference from neighboring cells. Therefore, the development of efficient algorithms for interference mitigation at the mobile receiver has recently attracted a lot of attention in academia and industry. There have been a number of studies on advanced interference cancellation and suppression techniques for the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) of LTE/LTE A carrying data packets to the users. One of the most promising schemes identified for demodulation of PDSCH is the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. It was shown by link-level analysis that the joint ML detection of serving and interfering signals can provide performance improvement. Due to its performance benefits, the ML receiver should be also considered for demodulation of other downlink channels including the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) which carries downlink and uplink scheduling assignments. However, a number of issues specific only to PDCCH could make problematic the use of the conventional ML receiver designed for PDSCH. More specifically, transparent power control on PDCCH (i.e., without network signaling to the user) at both serving and interfering cells as well as random interference hit from PDCCH transmissions of interfering cells may result to non-negligible performance degradation of PDCCH when the conventional ML receiver is used. Therefore, in this paper we propose an enhanced ML receiver for the PDCCH with the ability of blind power boosting estimation and interference hit detection. Using link-level simulations it is shown that in interference limited scenarios the proposed ML receiver provides remarkable error rate improvements for PDCCH over the conventional ML and linear receivers such as Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) and Enhanced Minimum Mean-Squared Error with Interference Rejection Combining (E-MMSE-IRC)."
1094925,20178,369,LTE Amplify and Forward Relaying for Indoor Coverage Extension,2010,"In many countries more than 70 % of the traffic on cellular networks originates or terminates inside buildings. Driven by an increasing demand for mobile data services, the iPhone effect, this number is expected to rise even higher within the next years. When rolling out new systems addressing high speed data needs, e.g. LTE or HSPA+, a cost effective solution is explored by extending the outdoor macro coverage to in-side. In order to reduce the building penetration path loss, a relay can be used in an amplify and forward (AF) or decode and forward (DF) operation for improving the signal quality. The benefits of a DF relay on the achievable LTE downlink indoor coverage extension has been demonstrated in a previous paper. Implementing the DF relay, however, adds complexity to the system and decreases overall air-interface capacity due to the in-band backhauling. The question then arises as to what level of performance can be expected from a straight forward AF system. This paper reports on first measurement results from deploying a standard optical distributed antenna system (DAS) for the LTE downlink at 2.6 GHz in a LTE real-time testbed. Field trials are performed in a single cell single user setup within an indoor office scenario with various MIMO antenna installations. Results show that the full data throughput of 150 Mbps can be transferred from the macro cell to the inside of the building."
2026602,20178,369,A mobile hi-fi digital audio broadcasting scheme,1994,"The audio quality, robustness and complexity issues of a novel mobile digital audio broadcast (DAB) scheme are addressed. The audio codec is based on a combination of subband coding (SBC) and multipulse excited linear predictive coding (MPLPC), where the bit allocation is dynamically adapted according to both the signal power in different subbands and a perceptual hearing model. Typically a segmental signal to noise ratio (SEGSNR) in excess of 30 dB associated with high fidelity (hi-fi) subjective quality was achieved for 2.67 bits/sample transmissions at a mono bit rate of 86 kbits/s. Four different source-matched forward error correction (FEC) schemes were investigated in order to explore the complexity, bit rate and robustness trade-offs. When using 4 bit/symbol 16-level star-constellation quadrature amplitude modulation (16-StQAM) the overall signalling rate became approximately 30 kBaud, accommodating two stereo DAB channels in a conventional 200 kHz analogue FM channel's bandwidth. The diversity assisted DAB scheme required a channel signal to noise ratio (SNR) of about 25 dB for unimpaired audio quality via the worst-case Rayleigh fading mobile channel, when the mobile speed was 30 mph and the propagation frequency was 1.5 GHz. In case of the stationary Gaussian scenario an SNR of about 20 dB was required. >"
1490022,20178,10228,On Open versus Closed LTE-Advanced Femtocells and Dynamic Interference Coordination,2010,"Low-power home base stations, also known as femtocells, are one of the strong candidates for high data rate provisioning in indoor environments. Unfortunately, the benefits are not without new challenges in terms of interference management and efficient system operation. In this paper we take a closer look at several aspects associated with the deployment of LTE-Advanced home eNBs under two different access policies: closed subscriber group (CSG) and open subscriber group (OSG). Our results are derived from extensive downlink system level simulations. We limit our scope to dense-urban deployment of femtocells assuming dedicated carriers, i.e. no interference to/from the macro layer. Particularities of each access mode are discussed under different hard frequency re-use configurations. Our results indicate that an OSG deployment is indeed able to cut short the lower end of the SINR distribution when universal frequency re-use is employed. However, when other re-use configurations are considered, OSG no longer guarantees improved SINR conditions. In addition, we present additional results for the autonomous component carrier selection (ACCS) concept introduced in earlier contributions, providing strong suggestions that the scheme yields attractive performance benefits independently of the access policy selected by the operator. Finally, we point out that uplink results including realistic power control settings need to be considered before definitive conclusions can be safely drawn."
1176757,20178,369,Degrees of Freedom of Downlink Single- and Multi-Cell Multi-User MIMO Systems with Location Based CSIT,2013,"Multiple antennas facilitate the coexistence of multiple users in wireless communications, leading to spatial multiplexing and spatial division and to significant system capacity increase. However, this comes at the cost of very precise channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). We advocate the use of channel propagation models to transform location information into (possibly incomplete) CSIT. We investigate the resulting multi-user sum rate from a DoF (Degree of Freedom, high SNR rate prelog, spatial multiplexing factor) point of view. For single-cell multi-user communications, we argue for a revival of SDMA (Spatial Division Multiple Access). In the MIMO case, the receive antennas can suppress the Non Line of Sight (NLoS) channel components to transform the MIMO channel into a MISO LoS channel, allowing the CSIT to be limited to LoS information. For the multi-cell problem, we consider the feasibility of interference aligment in the case of reduced rank MIMO channels. We then focus on the LoS components. Whereas in general MIMO multi-cell coordinated beamforming, the transmitters require global CSIT due to the coupling between transmit and receive filters, in the LoS case decoupling arises, permitting location based transmit beamforming. Location aided techniques may furthermore exploit location prediction through mobility trajectory information. This would allow slow fading (and even connectivity) predictibility, something that is difficult to achieve without location information."
2482602,20178,10228,Spectral- and energy-efficient antenna tilting in a HetNet using reinforcement learning,2013,"In cellular networks, balancing the throughput among users is important to achieve a uniform Quality-of-Service (QoS). This can be accomplished using a variety of cross-layer techniques. In this paper, the authors investigate how the down-tilt of base-station (BS) antennas can be adjusted to maximize the user throughput fairness in a heterogeneous network, considering the impact of both a dynamic user distribution and capacity saturation of different transmission techniques. Finding the optimal down-tilt in a multi-cell interference-limited network is a complex problem, where stochastic channel effects and irregular antenna patterns has yielded no explicit solutions and is computationally expensive. The investigation first demonstrates that a fixed tilt strategy yields good performances for homogeneous networks, but the introduction of HetNet elements adds a high level of sensitivity to the tilt dependent performance. This means that a HetNet must have network-wide knowledge of where BSs, access-points and users are. The paper also demonstrates that transmission techniques that can achieve a higher level of capacity saturation increases the optimal down-tilt angle. A distributed reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, where BSs do not need knowledge of location data. The algorithm can achieve convergence to a near-optimal solution rapidly (6-15 iterations) and improve the throughput fairness by 45-56% and the energy efficiency by 21-47%, as compared to fixed strategies. Furthermore, the paper shows that a tradeoff between the optimal solution convergence rate and asymptotic performance exists for the self-learning algorithm."
1581207,20178,369,An Adaptive MIMO System Using Incremental Diversity,2013,"In the recent years, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems have emerged as a promising technology that offers reliability and spectral efficiency. Since then a great concern was devoted to enhance the performance of MIMO systems through efficient encoding and decoding techniques. Two famous MIMO approaches have emerged; Spatial Multiplexing (SM), and Space Time Block Coding (STBC). On one hand, SM offers high data rates. On the other hand, STBC presents transmission fidelity. This actually imposed a fundamental tradeoff between capacity and reliability. For a more efficient utilization of the MIMO resources, a combination between SM and STBC grasps both spectral efficiency and reliability. Hybrid SM/STBC was introduced as a MIMO system technology that offers the advantages of the two systems simultaneously. In this paper, an adaptive MIMO system that incrementally switches from multiplexing towards diversity or hybrid diversity/multiplexing is proposed. The system is initialized with a pure multiplexing mode. An error detection check is performed at the receiver side and successful detection is fed back to the transmitter via an acknowledgement. A negative acknowledgement due to false detection triggers the transmitter to incrementally switch towards the diversity mode where it sends a part of the redundancy symbols constituting an STBC or a hybrid SM/STBC - diversity mode. The incremental diversity symbols are transmitted until a positive acknowledgment is received or the transmitter exhausts its full diversity capabilities. Results indicate that, the proposed scheme combines the transmission reliability offered by MIMO diversity, while maintaining a gradual increase in the spectral efficiency in correspondence to the increase in the SNR."
613990,20178,21066,Gibbs-sampling-based optimization for the deployment of small cells in 3G heterogeneous networks,2013,"The growing popularity of mobile data services has placed great demands for wireless cellular networks to support higher throughput. One way to meet the rapidly growing traffic demand is through heterogeneous network (HetNet) deployment, which uses a mixture of macro cells and small cells (also known as micro- or pico-cells) to further enhance the spatial reuse and thus improves network throughput. In this paper, we propose a Gibbs-sampling based optimization method for the deployment of small cells in 3G networks. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to optimize the locations of multiple small cells with the goal of maximizing a given network utility function. The Gibbs sampling based (GSB) method intelligently balances two potentially conflicting considerations: (i) placing small cells close to congested areas; and (ii) minimizing interference with the existing macro cells and other small cells. We also describe two low-complexity algorithms, the greedy EcNo and the greedy hotspot algorithms. Both algorithms are widely used in industry and will be used as the performance benchmark. Extensive simulations have been conducted based on real traffic traces from the 3G data network. The numerical results show that the GSB placement leads to 10% higher throughput and 30% higher off-loading factor than the greedy solutions. Since the cost of deploying small nodes could be expensive and each city may need a large number of small nodes, the proposed results represent significant cost savings compared to greedy solutions."
2237918,20178,369,Demand-Responsive Pricing in Open Wireless Access Markets,2007,"Radio resource management (RRM) across operator boundaries is emerging as a salient feature for wireless systems beyond 3G. Until recently, research has been confined to solutions where cooperating networks enter explicit sharing agreements that define how responsibilities and revenues should be divided. An alternative would be to share the infrastructure implicitly by establishing an open wireless access market wherein networks not only compete for users on a long-term time-scale, but also on a much shorter time-base. This could be realized with an architecture where autonomous trade-agents, that reside in terminals and access points (APs), manage the resources through negotiations. In this paper we develop a framework for studying demand-responsive pricing in contexts where APs with overlapping coverage compete for users. Resources are partitioned through a proportional fair divisible auction and our aim is to establish if, and when, an open market for wireless access can be self-sustained. Compared to a scenario where APs cooperate, our results show that, an open access market results in better services at lower price which in the prolonging also yields more satisfied customers. As an effect demand will increase and, from the perspective of the APs, act as a counterbalance to the reduced prices. Thus, the revenue earned by the APs will be comparable to the one in which obtained through AP cooperation and monopoly (cartel) pricing. Generally speaking, the difference between the cooperative and noncooperative RRM is small when the demand is concave and increases with the convexity of demand."

2464400,20178,369,Multiplexing of short real-time messages for road transport informatics systems,1994,"Avoiding traffic collapses requires intelligent and integrated traffic systems, all of which rely on communication systems. For future dedicated short range communication systems (SRC), a 1 GHz band between 63 and 64 GHz has been assigned, integrating all kinds of road transport and traffic telematics (RTTT) services. This system will support both communication between vehicles and infrastructure (via beacons) as well as inter-vehicle communication. The data to be transmitted will consist mainly of short messages, either broadcasted to all receiving neighbour stations (cooperative driving, route guidance) or exchanged in handshake protocols in a point-to-point dialogue (road pricing, parking management). A crucial point for system performance will therefore be the multiplexing and blocking unit, which has to combine these short, variable length messages into transmission packets, taking into account their respective real-time constraints. The complexity of this task is increased by the fact that all SRC systems are based on time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, so after each transmission a reaccess delay has to be met. We present a new type of integrated blocking/multiplexing unit particularly suited for inter-vehicle communication systems. It aims to minimise the age of received information concerning the redundancy in cooperative driving messages that are repeated frequently (/spl les/20 Hz). The simulation results show the improvement over well-known strategies like head of the line (HOL). >"
731302,20178,369,TOU-Aware Energy Management and Wireless Sensor Networks for Reducing Peak Load in Smart Grids,2010,"The electricity grid is undergoing a major renovation and becoming a smart grid by integrating the advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Current applications in energy generation, power distribution and its consumption need improvement in several ways, such as, making efficient use of green energy, increasing automation in distribution and enabling residential energy management. The existing grid does not provide sufficient mechanisms to manage the residential electricity consumption. However, interconnecting consumer devices with the home area networks, and at the same time, communicating with the utility networks through a home gateway facilitate residential energy management in smart grids. Residential energy management uses utility-driven price signals which vary depending on the time of the day. This is called as Time Of Use (TOU) pricing. In TOU pricing, electricity consumption during peak hours costs more than electricity consumption during off-peak hours. TOU prices reflect the variation in the actual cost of power during one day. Utilities run bas plants to supply power for the base load. In peak hours, demands of the consumers rise, and utilities bring peaker plants online to supply additional power. Peaker plants have higher operating costs and higher GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emission rates than base plants. Therefore, reducing peak load decreases the expenses for energy generation and it decreases the GHG emissions. Wireless sensor networks can play a key role in reducing the demand of the consumers in peak hours. In this paper, we employ TOU-aware energy management in a smart home with wireless sensor home area network and analyze the impact of this schemes on the peak load. We show that our scheme decreases the use of the appliances in peak hours and reduces the energy bills for consumers."
1305477,20178,369,Increasing the Capacity of Large-Scale HetNets through Centralized Dynamic Data Offloading,2014,"Typically, mobile users cluster around points of interest in dense urban environments such as city centers forming so-called data traffic hot spots and hot zones. To provide capacity to such users efficiently, mobile operators deploy small cells. However, the deployment of heterogeneous networks, which consist of overlaying macro cells and many co-channel small cells, entails many problems. One typical problem is that, more often than not, hot spot users are not covered by the small cells due to the spatially fluctuating nature of the traffic demand. Data offloading, meaning actively shifting macro cell users to small cells, is a promising approach to address this issue. In this paper, we extend a queuing-theoretic model based on the notion of elastic data flows in order to model data offloading, or more specifically, cell range expansion along with inter-cell interference coordination. The model explicitly considers mutual co-channel interference and enables predicting the performance of networks consisting of hundreds of cells with very low computational effort. Based on this model, we present a heuristic centralized data offloading algorithm, which, for a certain traffic demand, is able to increase the 5 th percentile of the data flow throughput by a factor of 4.5 and to halve the probability of service unavailability. Moreover, we show that the network capacity can be increased by about 41.3 % if data offloading is performed.

2464071,20178,8228,Distributed Differential Space-Time Spreading for the Asynchronous Relay Aided Interference-Free Cooperative CDMA Uplink,2010,"In this paper, we propose a differential Space-Time Coding (STC) scheme designed for asynchronous cooperative networks, where neither channel estimation nor symbol-level synchronization is required at the cooperating nodes. More specifically, our system employs differential encoding during the broadcast phase and a Space-Time Spreading (STS)-based amplify-and-forward scheme during the cooperative phase in conjunction with interference rejection Direct Sequence (DS) spreading codes, namely Loosely Synchronized (LS) codes. The LS codes exhibit a so-called Interference Free Window (IFW), where both the autocorrelation and cross-correlation values of the codes become zero. The IFW allows us to eliminate both the Multi-User Interference (MUI) as well as the potential dispersion-induced orthogonality degradation of the cooperative space-time codeword and the interference imposed by the asynchronous transmissions of the relay nodes. Furthermore, the destination node can beneficially combine both the directly transmitted and the relayed symbols using low-complexity correlation operations combined with a hard-decision detector. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Cooperative Differential STS (CDSTS) scheme is capable of combating the effects of asynchronous uplink transmissions without any Channel State Information (CSI), provided that the maximum synchronization delay of the relay nodes is within the width of IFW. It will be demonstrated that in the frequency-selective environment considered our CDSTS arrangement is capable of exploiting both space-time diversity and multi-path diversity with the aid of a RAKE combiner."
2049291,20178,369,Non-Colliding First Messages in Slotted ALOHA: Further Insights Toward a Practical Solution,2009,"Consider n nodes competing for access on a channel using slotted ALOHA. Our aim is to maximize the probability Φ that the first message within s slots does not collide. We derive an expression for the transmit probabilities in each slot, maximizing Φ. As opposed to previous work, the expression is non-recursive, thus easier to calculate and more convenient for practical implementations. Furthermore, we address the problem that, in practical applications, the number of competing nodes n is likely to be unknown and has to be estimated by each node. We study the sensitivity of channel access scheme with respect to deviations from the actual n via simulations. It is shown that overestimation of n is a better strategy than underestimation. • First, the computation of the optimum transmit proba- bilities requires each node to know the number n of nodes participating in the channel access competition on the shared medium. If this number is unknown, a node has to estimate it. An open research issue is thus to determine the impact on the performance due to errors in this estimation. The paper at hand investigates this issue, analyzing the sensitivity of the non-colliding first message probability as a function of the relative estimation error. It is shown that significant estimation errors lead to only small performance degradations, and that in general an overestimation of n is better than an underestimation. • Second, the calculation of the optimal slot access strategy is based on a recursive equation that depends on n in each recursion. This means the following: if the number of nodes changes, all s recursions must be recalculated. The paper at hand derives an alternative expression for the optimal transmit probabilities that enables us to store them in a table, where the values are independent from the number of nodes n."
1451190,20178,369,Spectrum Reorganization and Bundling for Power Efficient Mobile Networks,2012,"Technological improvements and evolving user requirements have led to operators running and supporting three distinct wireless access technologies, GSM, UMTS, and LTE. While the most recent layer (LTE) introduces improvements in spectral efficiency and peak data rates, the remaining layers are still required for supporting legacy devices and providing wider network coverage. In order to facilitate and reduce the cost of rolling out a new network, mobile operators often reuse existing sites. Radio frequency modules in base station sites house power amplifiers, which are designed to operate within a specific frequency band. Since some access technologies have spectrum split onto multiple bands, this results in operators installing multiple modules for each access technology. This paper quantifies the power savings that can be achieved by assuming that the available spectrum for an operator can be reorganized within a single band, and have multiple carriers bundled together to fully exploit the capabilities of modern equipment. These modifications are applied on all network layers, maintaining the same number of carriers and baseband capacity. For the presented case, this results in the elimination of at least four separate modules in each site, reducing the power consumption of by 31%. Indirectly, this also translates into a reduced site space of 40%. These savings are crucial for mobile network operators to reach the energy and carbon emission targets they have committed for."

At any given time instant, only one transmitter is active and the others are inactive. A transmitter in space is considered as a spatial constellation point which is assigned a unique bit sequence. Consequently, transmitters are turned on and off depending on the incoming data bits, similar to the activation of constellation points in traditional digital modulation schemes. Hence, a data rate of the base two logarithm of the number of transmit units is achieved. The active transmitter radiates a certain intensity level at a particular time instant. At the receiver side, the optimal SM detector is slightly modified and used to estimate the spatial constellation point. The estimated spatial constellation point is used to arrive at the original bit stream via de-mapping. The upper bound bit-error-ratio (BER) of OSM is analyzed for a MIMO configuration consisting of four transmit units (light emitting diodes (LEDs)) and four receive units (photo diodes (PDs)) in a room. The BER performance is determined for different transmitter and receiver separation distances and different transmitter half power semiangles. It is shown that the proposed OSM technique achieves twice and four times the data rate as compared to OOK (on-off keying) and PPM (pulse-position modulation), respectively."
2814626,20178,369,An mmWave Wireless Communication and Radar Detection Integrated Network for Railways,2016,"With large available continuous bandwidth, millimeter wave (mmWave) bands hold promise as a carrier frequency for fifth generation (5G) wireless communications. Moreover, mmWave bands also play an important role in radar detections. Based on this observation, we propose an mmWave wireless communication and radar detection integrated network architecture for railways, not only to increase the capacity of railway wireless communication systems, but also to realize train operation environment detection to enhance train operation safety. To overcome the aggravated path loss in mmWave bands, directional beamforming is generally used to concentrate signal radiation energy both in wireless communications and radar detections. Nevertheless, for wireless communications, the signaling blind zone of directional beamforming makes it less effective in wireless link establishment and maintenance. Therefore, in this proposed integrated network, two frequency bands are employed, where omnidirectionally radiated licensed lower frequency bands carry critical signaling and data, and mmWave bands are time-division multiplexed to transmit large-volume communication data for trains, or to perform environment detection for enhancing train operation safety. To mitigate handovers and to increase baseband processing resource utilization in railway scenarios, the proposed integrated network is deployed based on the cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture, where both licensed lower frequency band radio remote units (RRUs) and mmWave band RRUs are connected to a building baseband unit (BBU) pool through high-speed backhauls. Besides, physical (PHY) frame structures and up/downlink communication signaling procedures are designed for this proposed integrated network. Performance analysis results have demonstrated that the proposed integrated network can highly increase the capacity for railway wireless communication systems and achieve high distance and angular resolution for radar detections."
322061,20178,369,Self Coordination among SON Functions in LTE Heterogeneous Networks,2015,"In a self-organized Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, different Self-Organizing Network (SON) functions or different instances of the same SON function can execute parallel actions, which interact or collide among each other. When the effect of the interaction negatively affects the performances of the system, this is referred to in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a SON conflict, which needs to be handled by means of a self-coordination framework. We focus on the self-coordination of different actions taken by two SON functions in a distributed SON (D-SON) architecture, which implements the SON functions at the edges of the network. We propose a multi-agent framework where each Enhanced Node Base station (eNB), is an autonomous agent modeled by means of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We subdivide this global Markov Decision problem onto simpler subMDPs modeling the different SON functions. Each sub-problem is defined as an MDP and solved independently, and their individual policies are combined to obtain a global policy. This combined policy can execute several actions per state in parallel, but can introduce policy conflicts, which model the mentioned SON conflicts. Each subMDP is solved by means of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. We focus on the SON conflict generated by the concurrent execution of Coverage and Capacity Optimization (CCO) and Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) SON functions, which may require to update the same parameter, i.e. the transmission power level. Coordination among different actions is achieved by means of a coordination game where the players are the subMDPs and the actions and rewards are those provided by the independent RL solutions. Performance evaluation is carried out in a ns3 release 10 compliant LTE system simulator and it shows that our self-coordination approach provides satisfying solutions in terms of system performances for both the conflicting SON functions."
2631071,20178,369,Statistical Analysis of Cars Induced Scattering in 60 GHz UWB Outdoor Channels,2015,"Millimeter-waves radio technology is attracting great interest because large portions of radio spectrum are available from about 30 to beyond 90 GHz to support modern bandwidth- hungry applications with QoS requirements. Fifth generation of mobile communications is mainly envisaged in the spectrum around 28-40 GHz, whereas 60 GHz band is mostly used for indoor wireless local area networks (WLANs). However, with 7 GHz of available bandwidth, 60 GHz links could play a key role for outdoor backhaul, street lamps hot-spots and video surveillance. Studies of 60 GHz outdoor channels are currently limited. Outdoor channels are usually sparser than indoor channels, but the presence of scatterers like, e.g., cars, in the proximity of the link may induce specific patterns in the multipath composition. In this paper, we provide a statistical analysis of the effect of scatterers with large electromagnetic surface, namely cars, on multipath propagation of 60 GHz ultra- wideband (UWB) signals. The analysis is based on experimental data collected in two parking areas with and without parked cars, where a 60 GHz UWB radio transmits from street lamps towards collector points located in the proximity of a building. The measurements were done at eight carrier frequencies in the region 54-66 GHz, using a tunable sliding correlator, thus results also show the channel behavior vs. frequency."
2520739,20178,369,Space-time turbo equalization in frequency-selective MIMO channels,2003,"A computationally efficient space-time turbo equalization algorithm is derived for frequency-selective multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The algorithm is an extension of the iterative equalization algorithm by Reynolds and Wang (see Signal Processing, vol.81, no.5, p.989-995, 2001) for frequency-selective fading channels and of iterative multiuser detection for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems by Wang and Poor (see IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.47, p.1046-1061, 1999). The proposed algorithm is implemented as a MIMO detector consisting of a soft-input-soft-output (SISO) linear MMSE detector followed by SISO channel decoders for the multiple users. The detector first forms a soft replica of each composite interfering signal using the log likelihood ratio (LLR), fed back from the SISO channel decoders, of the transmitted coded symbols and subtracts it from the received signal vector. Linear adaptive filtering then takes place to suppress the interference residuals: filter taps are adjusted based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. The LLR is then calculated for adaptive filter output. This process is repeated in an iterative fashion to enhance signal-detection performance. This paper also discusses the performance sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to channel-estimation error. A channel-estimation scheme is introduced that works with the iterative MIMO equalization process to reduce estimation errors."
3106891,20178,369,Measurement-Based Analysis of Relaying Performance for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications with Large Vehicle Obstructions,2016,"It has been widely recognized that relaying is an important method for increasing the reliability and spectral efficiency of communications systems, and it is thus helpful for improving the performance of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication systems. However, designing and evaluating V2V relay networks require understanding the effect of shadowing, as this critically impacts the performance of the relay system. Even though the theoretic performances of various relaying schemes have been well investigated, there is a lack of empirical test that incorporates realistic shadowing effects. In this paper, we analyze the performance of relaying transmission in V2V scenarios based on measurements in scenarios where shadowing occurs through large vehicles such as buses. We investigate several potential locations for the relay nodes, and the measurements are performed with two static transmitters (TX) and one dynamic receiver (RX). Outage probabilities of several relaying schemes such as multi-hop decode-and- forward, multi-hop amplify-and-forward, and diversity-amplify-and-forward are estimated and discussed based on the measured instantaneous end- to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is found that: (i) shadowing effect caused by the bus between V2V line-of-sight (LOS) links increases the outage probability for the non-LOS (NLOS) direct transmission; (ii) using relay node on the bus roof can significantly improve transmission, however, a strong shadowing effect may reduces the acceptable communication distance of relaying scheme; and (iii) the diversity-amplify-and- forward relaying scheme generally has the best performance. Our results can be used to design a relay system for V2V communications."
675548,20178,369,Performance analysis of the collision avoidance procedure of the advanced infrared (AIr) CSMA/CA protocol for wireless LANs,2002,"The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) advanced infrared (AIr) protocol for indoor optical wireless LAN is examined. AIr medium access control (MAC) layer utilizes a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme to coordinate medium access. To deal with hidden stations, AIr employs a request to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) reservation scheme and a long collision avoidance slot (CAS) duration that includes the beginning of the receiver's CTS packet. AIr employs linear adjustment of the contention window (CW) size to minimize delays emerging from the long CAS duration. This paper develops an analytical model for the collision avoidance scheme of the AIr protocol that computes throughput performance assuming error free transmissions and a fixed number of stations. The model is validated by comparing analysis with simulation results. By differentiating the throughput equation, the optimum CW size that maximises throughput as a function of the number of the transmitting stations is derived. In the case of the AIr protocol where a collision lasts exactly one CAS, different conclusions result for maximum throughput as compared with the corresponding conclusions for the similar IEEE 802.11 protocol. By employing the analytical model, throughput performance for various parameter values is evaluated. The proposed linear CW adjustment is very effective in minimizing delays emerging from empty slots and collisions during the contention period. Linear CW adjustment combined with the long CAS duration provides an effective protection from collisions caused by hidden stations and offers an attractive collision avoidance scheme."
917580,20178,10228,Enhancing the efficiency of cluster-based networks through MISO techniques,2012,"Towards the realization of the Internet of Things (IoT), cellular networks are expected to play a fundamental role, providing the ubiquitous coverage and global internetworking. However, due to the physical limitations, namely energy consumption or hardware complexity, of many of these objects, the direct communication with the cellular infrastructure is hindered. In this sense, cluster-based networks have been introduced as an efficient solution, offering coverage extension and energy savings. The energy efficiency and performance of these networks can be further enhanced if the devices can choose between two or more cluster-heads towards their connection to the infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel cluster-head (CH) selection algorithm, where the nodes can switch between different CHs, according to the corresponding signal strength, in order to maintain a predefined quality of service constraint. We show that the network reliability significantly increases, especially when considering mobile scenarios, where the connection to a CH may be not feasible, due to shadowing. In addition, the CHs are equipped with multiple antennas for enhanced performance. The performance of this scheme is theoretically investigated over correlated Nakagami-m multipath fading channels, subject also to shadowing. By considering Gamma distributed shadow effects, convenient expressions for important statistical metrics are obtained. The theoretical analysis is accompanied by representative performance evaluation results, complemented by equivalent computer simulated ones, which validate the accuracy of the proposed analysis."
2158376,20178,369,Resource auction multiple access (RAMA) in the cellular environment,1994,"Resource auction multiple access (RAMA) is a technique for rapidly assigning communication resources (e.g., TDMA time slots) in a wireless environment. This scheme is deterministic in that, barring errors caused by fading and noise, a resource assignment is made in each and every assignment cycle. Previous papers reported on the call assignment capacity of this technique and also demonstrated its capabilities for statistical speech multiplexing. In these studies, we used a selected set of GSM parameters while assuming perfect radio channel operation. In this paper, we extend the previous work in two directions: (1) we examine the effects of channel fading and noise; and (2) we consider both GSM and IS-54 cellular environments. Propagation is modeled, for purposes of this study, as flat Rayleigh fading, with mean propagation loss as a parameter. We focus on the subscriber-to-base link, which is most vulnerable to RAMA errors, and consider several forms of diversity at the base. We also consider two RAMA modes (call assignment only and statistical speech multiplexing). RAMA signaling is two-level amplitude shift keying (ASK). We show that a simple form of two-branch diversity can be very effective. Our final results show the probability of assignment error as a function of mean propagation loss for different diversities, systems, and average transmit powers. In IS-54, for example, simple diversity and an average transmit power of 100 mW yields error probabilities of 58 or less for losses as high as 154 dB. We also show that such error rates are more than adequate for purposes of call assignment. >"
498242,20178,369,A Throughput Study of White-Fi Networks in Rural Environment under Realistic Conditions and Mobility,2015,"The regulatory framework for secondary utilization of TV white spaces (TVWS) is well underway in the United Kingdom, while important steps in this direction are taken within the European Union and elsewhere. Mobile network operators are interested in the use of TVWS for cellular extension and rural access, where TVWS is seen as a significant new opportunity for operators to provide new wireless services. The government's plan to close the digital divide between the urban and rural communities has motivated the efforts to develop Wi-Fi like operation in TVWS for better coverage in rural areas. The IEEE currently has a working group developing 802.11af amendment which will allow for WLAN operations in the TVWS. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of downlink throughput performance of IEEE802.11af, also known as White-Fi in a rural environment while taking into account realistic modelling of TV channel availability, wireless channel, AP density, and the effect of co-channel interference caused by secondary APs and DVB-T transmitters. The paper shows that the low operating frequency of White-Fi offers a wide coverage in a rural environment, where there is limited cellular coverage due to the cost-inefficiency of base stations deployment. The presented results also show that there are more available TVWS channels and less co-channel interferers in a rural environment, resulting in a significant throughput performance even in high mobility if suitable channel estimation is considered, making it ideal for vehicular communications with White-Fi."
746850,20178,369,Path-Loss and Car-Body-Effect Characterization for Smart Tires Communications at UWB and ISM Bands,2014,"Next generation of smart tires will improve the safety and stability of the vehicle by monitoring road parameters, such as pavement and rolling conditions, with sensors placed on tire surface. Between the tread and the metal belt of the tire there are only few millimeters of rubber, therefore high miniaturization is necessary to withstand at the extremely high accelerations and to fit in this very limited room. Such kind of miniaturization poses huge limitations on antenna efficiency and available power likely provided by energy scavengers. Therefore, the optimization of the wireless power budget is crucial and it passes through the study of the communication channel. This paper presents a characterization setup that measures the path-loss from the tire surface to the inside of the car where the standard RF receivers, such as RKE at 434 MHz and Bluetooth at 2.4 GHz, are usually located. A calibration procedure has been employed in order to de-embed car-body-effects from the overall path-loss. Moreover, a 4.1 GHz UWB radio has also been considered in this study motivated by the extremely low-power consumption reached by UWB transmitters. The measurement results reflect a complex propagation environment where the car body attenuation plays a marginal role. Instead, the antenna pattern and the reflections from the environment cause the largest attenuation. Moreover, the observed link budget margin is larger and more suitable for implementation within the ISM bands than for the UWB band."
2637811,20178,369,Multi-Size Cell Expansion for Energy-Efficient Cell Breathing in Green Wireless Networks,2015,"Cell breathing is a mechanism used in cellular networks since many years, which is now proposed for energy efficient purposes. By using this technique, it is possible to save energy during low traffic periods by switching unnecessary BSs off whereas the cell topology is re-adapted supported on some few BSs active. In this article, we analyze a multi-size approach which provide means for an enhanced cell topology adaptation. We divide our approach in two redistribution phases. Each of these two phases is conceived for being efficient at specific traffic levels. A first configuration phase only allows short range cell expansion to cover just direct adjacent sectors, which works well for medium traffic load. Then if low load conditions afford it, a second phase may be executed which allows an extended multi-size expansion making it possible to cover additional sectors at a far distance, which results in some new larger cells and some extra BSs switched-off. The decision mechanism makes it possible to choose the best strategy between running phase 1 only or phase 1 & 2 combined. Our approach is supported on a clustered architecture which distributes the computational load in the network. Each cluster consists of groups of BSs with a BS cluster head in charge of making decisions based on power saving indicators. Simulation and results are provided to analyze each of the potential approaches supported on phase 1 and 2 redistribution. It is shown that some interesting energy savings are obtained when each of our proposed phases is conveniently applied."
2885771,20178,369,Framework to Support Mobility Context Awareness in Cellular Networks,2016,"Mobile communication is arguably the most ubiquitously used technology in contemporary world, evolving towards its fifth generation (5G). The key challenges being faced by present day mobile communication are growing number of mobile users and subsequent high traffic volume posed by them. Providing uniform service quality and best quality of experience (QoE) in such dense scenarios is a major motive of 5G. Context awareness is a concept of extracting information from the user and his environment, and utilizing it to optimize user performance. Context awareness is recognized as one of the key pillars in enabling uniform quality of experience for mobile users. For instance, predicting the next cell for user transition, predicting the crowd formation in a cell etc., will assist the basestation to reserve or manage resources and prepare the cell well in advance for a future event, targeting to provide uninterrupted and uniform QoE. This paper investigates context aware procedures with a focus on user mobility, finds commonalities among different procedures and proposes a general framework to support mobility context awareness. The new information and interfaces which are required from various entities (e.g., vehicular infrastructure) are discussed. Further, a context aware resource allocation algorithm is designed, exploiting new interfaces and information arising from vehicular infrastructure. Simulation results demonstrate improvements in user throughput, thus validating the requirement of new interfaces."
2222321,20178,369,Joint Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation in Frequency Selective MIMO Correlated Fading Channels,2009,"In this paper, we address the problem of frequency offset and channel gains estimation for correlated multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels. The channel is assumed to be frequency-selective and block fading with both spatial and multipath correlations. A maximum-likelihood (ML) frequency offset (FO) estimator is proposed by using the Baysian approach and the mean and variance of the FO estimation are derived. To evaluate the performance of the FO estimator, its Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is also developed. Based on the FO estimate, we derive the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimator and analytically investigate the effect of frequency offset estimation error on the mean square error (MSE) performance of the channel estimator. Finally, the performances of the FO and channel estimation are evaluated by simulation results. I. INTRODUCTION Recent research in information theory has shown that a MIMO communication system can efficiently increase system capacity and reliability in rich scattering wireless channel environments without additional power and frequency spectrum requirements as traditional techniques need (1). However, to exploit the capacity advantage of MIMO systems, the accurate channel state information (CSI) is required at the receiver. Therefore, accurate and efficient channel estimation plays a key role in MIMO communication systems. Furthermore, the performance of such MIMO systems may be seriously degraded in the presence of frequency offset that are unavoidable due to synchronization error between the transmitter and the receiver as well as motion-induced Doppler shifts. Thus, both frequency offset (FO) estimation and channel gain (CG) estimation are crucial to MIMO systems. For FO and CG estimation, two classes of methods are extensively studied: 1. blind methods, which estimate FO and"
1981592,20178,8228,Greedy and progressive user scheduling for CoMP wireless networks,2012,"In this work, we propose progressive user scheduling (PUS) and distributed successive zero-forcing (SZF) precoding for clustered coordinated multi-point transmission/reception (CoMP) systems. With joint transmission (JT) across a cluster of cells, centralized processing of precoding and user scheduling requires significant bandwidth resources for information exchange among coordinated base stations (BTSs) and the central controller, and channel state information (CSI) feedback from all users in the cluster to the central controller. In this work, we propose a greedy progressive user scheduling (PUS) and distributed SZF precoding to reduce CSI feedback and information exchange. With PUS, each BTS schedules and precodes its users in the coverage area of its cell separately from other BTSs in a cluster, but takes limited amount of feedback information available from other BTSs into account for user scheduling. Once the users are scheduled in that cell, BTS passes precoder information of the scheduled users to the next BTS. The second BTS schedules users in its cell taking the information from the first BTS into account. This process continues until the last BTS in the cluster schedules its users. With PUS, users in a cell do not completely estimate CSI from other cells in the cluster, which may significantly reduce the CSI feedback. Also, central controller is not necessarily required, but it may be utilized for limited amount of control signalling, e.g. an order in which the BTSs should schedule their users. Due to its distributed implementation, the proposed technique enables the use of various existing single-cell multiuser MIMO techniques that have been already standardized or proposed in the literature. In this work, we investigate the performance of greedy PUS and compare it with the greedy user selection for JT. It is shown that PUS can achieve sum rate close to the JT technique."
2600817,20178,369,Study on Scheduling Techniques for Ultra Dense Small Cell Networks,2015,"The most promising approach to enhance network capacity for the next generation of wireless cellular networks (5G) is densification, which benefits from the extensive spatial reuse of the spectrum and the reduced distance between transmitters and receivers. In this paper, we examine the performance of different schedulers in ultra dense small cell deployments. Due to the stronger line of sight (LOS) at low inter-site distances (ISDs), we discuss that the Rician fading channel model is more suitable to study network performance than the Rayleigh one, and model the Rician K factor as a function of distance between the user equipment (UE) and its serving base station (BS). We also construct a cross-correlation shadowing model that takes into account the ISD, and finally investigate potential multi-user diversity gains in ultra dense small cell deployments by comparing the performances of proportional fair (PF) and round robin (RR) schedulers. Our study shows that as network becomes denser, the LOS component starts to dominate the path loss model which significantly increases the interference. Simulation results also show that multi-user diversity is considerably reduced at low ISDs, and thus the PF scheduling gain over the RR one is small, around 10\% in terms of cell throughput. As a result, the RR scheduling may be preferred for dense small cell deployments due to its simplicity. Despite both the interference aggravation as well as the multi-user diversity loss, network densification is still worth it from a capacity view point."
1155316,20178,369,"Inter-RAT MRO in 3GPP Rel.11: What Works, and What Does Not",2013,"With deploying LTE (Long-Term Evolution) network operators are faced with managing up to three partly overlaying network deployments of different radio access technologies (RATs), for instance, GSM, UMTS and LTE. A concerted management of all three RATs requires self-organizing networks (SON) functionalities which have become an essential part of LTE. One prominent use case is mobility robustness optimization (MRO) and, recently, inter-RAT MRO has been discussed and specified in 3GPP as part of the Rel.11 SON framework. Hereto, a network deployment scenario was assumed where the existing legacy cellular network (for instance UMTS) provides full coverage, while LTE network deployment is limited to areas with high user penetration. Consequently, 3GPP focused on two inter-RAT failure cases, namely too late handover from LTE to 3G and too early handover from 3G to LTE, where the latter case refers to a handover triggered to LTE while the quality offered there is too poor to maintain the call. All other inter-RAT handover failure cases are not considered in Rel.11. In this paper, we investigate the performance of an inter-RAT MRO algorithm based on the Rel.11 capabilities with the reduced set of key performance indicators (KPIs) being applied to deployment scenario where 3G is not ubiquitous and LTE provides better coverage in some areas. The simulation results show that the algorithm with reduced KPI set performs very well for the considered limited LTE coverage scenario, but show expected deficiencies if deployment scenario changes."
1502143,20178,369,Impact of Backhaul Subframe Misalignment on Uplink System Performance of LTE-Advanced Relay Networks,2012,"Most work on relaying uplink assumes a strictly synchronized subframe partitioning between relay and access links among all eNBs. However, according to 3GPP guidelines eNBs can independently decide on different backhaul subframe configurations to adapt to, e.g. traffic variations, which then implies a backhaul subframe misalignment in the system. This configuration results in a new type of interference, referred to as relay-to-relay interference. In general, uplink interference characteristics will be significantly different compared to conventional fully synchronized configuration since the transmissions of relays and user equipments will interfere with each other. Accordingly, uplink power control parameters should be properly adjusted. In this work, we evaluate the impact of backhaul subframe misalignment on the uplink system performance of relay deployments within the LTE-Advanced framework considering 4 and 10-relay urban and suburban deployments. Besides, we investigate different inter eNB coordination and subframe alignment scenarios. Comprehensive results show that a backhaul subframe misalignment can cause severe losses especially in cell coverage depending on the degree of coordination possible, and the availability of directional antennas at relays for backhauling. It is further shown that a proper power control optimization can cope with such performance degradations in urban deployments. As the cell-edge eNB-served user equipments are power limited in suburban deployments, the impact of power control optimization can be limited. Therefore, relay cell range extension is as well utilized in suburban deployments so that these user equipments are then served by relays. However, the performance degradation cannot be fully compensated by power control and cell range extension in suburban deployments, and thus a certain level of inter-eNB coordination is necessary."
3198599,20178,369,Energy Detection with Diversity Combining over KG Fading for Cognitive VANET,2016,"Continuous evaluation in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) will contribute to spectrum scarcity problem in near future. Cognitive radio (CR) system aims to provide opportunistic access and adapt the available frequency resources instead of conventional static spectrum allocation. Spectrum sensing is one of the most demanding aspects in CR design and implementation. Low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and fading effects posed limitations to deploying CR in realistic propagation scenario with fast and fine sensing features. Energy detection(ED) based spectrum sensing is a viable choice for many vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-roadside infrastructure (V2I) communications. In this paper, we consider the performance of ED over composite Generalized-K (KG) fading to deal with both small and large scale fading in VANET. Diversity combining using Maximal ratio Combining (MRC) and Selective Combining (SC) over KG fading channel are investigated. A novel tractable expressio for Energy detection based average detection probability for optimal MRC diversity combining scheme is derived and closed form possibility is analyzed for SC. Both numerical and simulation models are examined for practical low to moderate shadow fading conditions. The results highlight the notable impact of shadowing spread and fading severity on detection performance and meliorating effects of employing combining techniques."
2143379,20178,369,Combined time and code division scheduling for enhanced uplink packet access in WCDMA,2004,"This paper contains an evaluation of three different time and code division schedulers, for data transmission on enhanced dedicated channel (E-DCH) in WCDMA uplink. Time scheduling on E-DCH is possible thanks to fast node B scheduling operation on a transmission time interval (TTI) basis. Time scheduling allows for allocating users for transmission with instantaneously high data rates, and possibly when they experience favourable channel conditions. The system capacity can therefore be increased, also because interference generated to other cells is reduced. We apply a combined time and code division scheduling strategy in three different cases: a blind fair throughput scheduler (BFT), a maximise transmit power efficiency scheduler (MTPE) and a channel-state aware fair throughput scheduler (CSAFT). The two latter schedulers utilise an appositely defined uplink channel quality indicator (UCQI) to exploit channel-state information in the packet scheduling procedure. While the MTPE scheduler maximises cell throughput at the cost of at low degree of fairness between users, the CSAFT algorithm is shown to offer an appealing trade-off between users' fairness and throughput maximisation. Under a specific outage constraint for the packet call throughput, the capacity gain of the CSAFT scheduler over a node B code division scheduler is 17% and 30% for vehicular A and pedestrian A channel profile at 3 km/h, respectively. The estimated capacity increase compared to a reference RNC-based scheduler is estimated between 50% and 80%, also depending on the propagation scenario."
2150704,20178,369,Performance and Capacity of HSUPA in Lab Environment,2008,"This paper analyzes the performance of HSUPA based on test results from a UMTS lab trial network. Different aspects from the technology have been studied in a controlled lab environment, including latency reduction by HSUPA, power control efficiency and capacity. HSUPA (high speed uplink packet access) is the next logical step following the deployment of HSDPA to offer a truly 3G high speed data service with higher throughputs and reduced latency. Despite the similarities with HSDPA (such as HARQ, short TTI, NodeB scheduling), HSUPA is fundamentally different because of the use of a dedicated channel per user, called E-DCH. This results in a very different treatment of radio resources management scheme, with UL power control instead of link adaptation, or a more challenging scheduling system. The traffic scheduling is rather random in HSUPA since all data users are not synchronized with each other, and therefore a common pipe cannot be established by the network for all users as it does for the downlink. The only common resource the system can control is the uplink noise rise. In a typical UMTS network, under interference limited condition, downlink is the bottleneck. However, with the introduction of E-DCH, it is important to understand its impact to the uplink performance and capacity, especially under conditions with mixed voice and data services on one carrier. The results from our study shows a good data performance of HSUPA in data only scenarios, however there is a significant degradation on the voice service when they share the same carrier."
718520,20178,369,Dynamic Demand Control with Differentiated QoS in User-in-the-Loop Controlled Cellular Networks,2013,"Cellular communications now and beyond 2020 faces a number of challenges. One of the trends is the ever increasing demand for data rate due to smart mobile devices with an estimated traffic growth of almost 100% per annum. Even with new cellular generation cycles every few years the same increase rate cannot be provided on the supply side. Neither anywhere nor anytime. The gap between supply and demand of wireless capacity will shorten and the conventional over-provisioning approach will not be possible anymore, especially during busy hours. The consequences are more frequent congestion situations with broken application traffic. The quality-of-experience will suffer as user expectations are high and steamed-up by advertising. An inadequate tariff system concentrating on flat-rates is also counterproductive for stability and energy-efficiency. In this paper the temporal user-in-the-loop (UIL) control approach is assumed. This user-centric model implements demand shaping by incentives in form of a dynamic usage-based tariff which adjusts based on the level of congestion in the busy hours. This is comparable to the smart grid operation principle. The novelty in this paper is the differentiated treatment for the exemplary service classes voice, video and data, for which new quantitative user response data is utilized.

Specifically, a comparison between a fixed slot allocation (FSA) scheme, where the uplink UL/DL switching is synchronised across the network, and the random time slot opposing (RTSO) technique is made. The RTSO resembles an opportunistic interference mitigation technique. RTSO, however, does not obviate the need for user scheduling algorithms, but the combined use of RTSO and scheduling has not been studied. Therefore, two different scheduling algorithms, greedy and fair, are adapted to suit the OFDMA-TDD architecture. Their performance for various channel asymmetries under RTSO and symmetric FSA is evaluated, based on spectral efficiency and user outage. In order to account for the exposed location of base station (BS) antennas in a cellular environment, the effect of line-of-sight (LOS) propagation among BSs is considered. The results show that LOS among BSs in a system with unsynchronised switching points strongly hampers the network's performance. This effect, however, is demonstrated to be substantially offset by DL-favoured asymmetries (dominant in data-centric networks) in combination with RTSO. Furthermore, it is shown that the greedy algorithm only offers a marginal increase in spectral efficiency as compared to the fair algorithm, while the fair algorithm exhibits up to ~20% lower outage."
1948651,20178,369,Minimum Energy Precoding in Receiver Oriented MIMO Multi-User Mobile Radio Downlinks,2007,"The idea of moving the workload of channel equalization from the receiver to the transmitter was first presented by Nakagawa and Esmailzadeh in 1993, when they proposed their pre-Rake for spread spectrum radio transmission. Today this idea is also known as preceding or receiver orientation (RO). The low receiver complexity enabled by RO makes it especially attractive for mobile radio downlinks (DL) with their demand of low cost mobile terminals (MT). Mostly, the considered RO transmission schemes considered up to now are linear with the result that their required transmit powers are virtually the same as in systems not resorting to RO. However, low transmit powers are of paramount importance both with respect to the public concern about electromagnetic irradiation, and to checking the disturbance of other radio links. In the present paper we ventilate the possibility of transmit power reduction in RO mobile radio DLs by introducing a non-linear feature. We set out from known linear RO schemes, in the demodulators of which discrete valued target points are aimed at in the complex plane in the sense of hard spot landings, and then, instead of this, introduce non-linearity by envisaging soft landings somewhere in suitably defined more or less extended continuous valued domains. In this way the constraints on the transmit signals are loosened, which opens the possibility to minimize the transmit powers. We term our approach minimum energy soft precoding (MESP) and demonstrate its efficacy by simulation results for MIMO OFDM multi-user mobile radio downlinks."
891652,20178,8228,Utilizing unused network capacity for battery lifetime extension of LTE devices,2012,"The average operational time of today's smart phones with one filling of the accumulator is one of the most important performance parameters for the customers of new devices. Nevertheless, this value is remaining constant or even decreasing in the last few years due to the continuously increasing complexity. On the other hand, for ensuring the fulfillment of the high user-requirements even under worst case conditions, novel cellular systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) are usually over-dimensioned in terms of the maximum available capacity. In this paper, a novel approach is presented which allows for trading in unused cell capacity for battery lifetime extension of the mobile devices. The basic idea in this context is to increase the robustness of the submitted uplink (UL) signal by decreasing the order of the modulation and coding scheme used. If the provided data rate is kept constant, this comes along with an increasing number of allocated Resource Blocks (RB) and therefore a decreased overall cell capacity. Nevertheless, the more robust signal allows for reducing the uplink transmit power while the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are still met. The results for exemplary Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic show that for users originally submitting at the maximum available transmit power, the consumed energy of the LTE chip-set can be reduced by up to 27.5 % applying this novel approach."
1270599,20178,10192,Radio Resource Allocation in Buildings with Dense Femtocell Deployment,2012,"Small cells are becoming essential to offer a promising solution for dramatic mobile traffic growth in future mobile networks. Especially, massive enterprise femtocells are expected to provide high capacity to fulfill high data demands in buildings in order to offload indoor traffic from outdoor macro cells in that over 80% of mobile data traffic is generated indoors. However, as one of the major challenges, inter-femtocell interference gets worse in 3D in-building scenarios because of the presence of numerous interfering sources and needs to be considered in the early network planning phase. The indoor network planning and optimization tool, iBuildNet®, makes accurate prediction of indoor wireless RF signal propagation possible to guide actual indoor femtocell deployments. In this paper, a semi-static resource allocation scheme based on fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is developed to avoid interference on cell edge users for dense indoor femtocell deployments. The minimum number of subbands used in the scenario is worked out with a node-coloring heuristic algorithm. Extensive simulations in a multi-floor building are performed over iBuildNet® to evaluate the performances of the developed scheme. The simulation results illustrate that the developed scheme outperform the traditional FFR-3 scheme that is popular in macro-cell networks, in terms of cell edge user data rate and average user data rate."
2414710,20178,369,Physical-layer issues for deploying transmit diversity in GPRS/EGPRS networks,2001,"Lindskog and Paulraj (see ICC-2000, June, 2000) proposed a transmit diversity scheme for dispersive channels which by utilizing two transmit antennas and only one receive antenna achieves the same diversity benefit (except for the 3 dB array gain) as can be achieved by using one transmit antenna and two receive antennas. This scheme generalizes Alamouti's (see IEEE JSAC, vol.16, no.8, p.1451-58, 1998) transmit diversity scheme (which works best for flat channels) to dispersive channels. We show how the transmit diversity (TXD) scheme of Lindskog et al. can be deployed in GPRS/FGPRS networks. A low-complexity receiver structure for demodulating Lindskog and Paulraj (LP) encoded signals is presented based on a combination of a novel pre-filter and a delayed decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE) equalizer. This pre-filter is designed to simultaneously achieve three desired effects: (1) the effective baseband channel seen by the equalizer has half the number of taps of the original baseband channel; (2) the effective response of the baseband channel becomes minimum-phase; and (3) the effective baseband noise is whitened. An information-theoretic analysis is also presented to demonstrate the advantage of the LP scheme over other TXD schemes (e.g. over delay diversity). A burst format for transmitting LP encoded signals which is compatible with the existing GPRS/EGPRS burst format is also presented. Finally, simulations results are presented to verify the benefit of using the LP scheme in the typical urban channel of GSM/EDGE."
2874708,20178,8228,Maximum likelihood estimation of clock skew in sparse one-way packet transmissions for machine type communication applications,2016,"Establishing and maintaining time synchronization among the nodes in a distributed wireless network with desired accuracy is challenging. In upcoming machine type communication (MTC) applications a fast, scalable and accurate synchronization method is highly desired. We view the clock synchronization problem as peer-to-peer (P2P) continuously running process where clock master with a stable clock source transmits packets with transmit time stamp. Synchronizing nodes listen these packets and apply receive time stamps. Based on the passive listening framework developed in [1], we propose Passive Sparse Maximum Likelihood Estimator (PSMLE) that uses two observations spaced sufficiently apart in time to estimate clock skew. The PSLME based skew estimate is further used by Passive Maximum Likelihood Estimator (PMLE) to estimate clock offset. The resulting enhanced-PMLE (ePMLE) improves estimation accuracy with fewer packet observations. Random component of the link delay is assumed to be Gaussian distributed. We observe that estimator accuracy is independent of propagation delay and distribution parameter and set them to zero without impacting the estimation accuracy. Further, we show that Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) does not exist for PSMLE. However we verify through analysis and simulations that by choosing nearly compact observation window for PSMLE and optimal number of packet observations for ePMLE, sub-millisecond (sub-ms) clock accuracy can be achieved for all practical MTC scenarios."
2046954,20178,369,Robust Linearly Constrained LSCM for Adaptive Interference Cancellation,2009,"This paper presents a robust least square constant modulus algorithm (LSCMA) for interference cancellation based on subspace decomposition in CDMA system. The conventional least square constant modulus algorithm (LSCMA) is easy to capture the interference signals in the system that has several constant modulus signals. In order to overcome this shortage, a linearly constrained LSCMA algorithm is proposed by applying the linear constrained condition to the LSCMA, thus makes the algorithm converge to the desired user. To further enhance the performance, we apply the subspace decomposition to autocorrelation matrix of the received signal, and combine the Lagrange method and the partial Taylor-series expansion to update the weight vector. To reduce the computational complexity, an orthogonal projection approximation subspace- tracking (OPAST) algorithm is employed for adaptive signal subspace estimation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has lower complexity, superior performance and is more robust in the case of random initial value. many constant modulus signals. Moreover, the LSCMA is also sensitive to the selection of the initial value (8), and the performance degrades significantly when the initial value is selected randomly. In this paper, a robust LSCMA based on subspace decomposition is proposed for interference cancellation. It uses the spreading code of the desired user to impose the linear constraint on the LSCMA, which can ensure that the algorithm converges to the desired user. The subspace decomposition is applied to the autocorrelation matrix of the received signal, which makes the algorithm update in the signal subspace. Thus the energy of the useful signal is increased, and thereby the corresponding detection performance is improved for any initial value. To obtain the weight vector, the Lagrange method and partial Taylor-series expansion are exploited to solve the optimal solution of the cost function. Moreover, an OPAST subspace tracking algorithm (9) is exploited for adaptive signal subspace estimation to reduce the computational complexity. It is shown that the proposed LSCMA can achieve better SINR performance than the conventional LSCMA with much less complexity, and is relatively more insensitive to the initial value."
1142152,20178,8228,"Joint beamforming, scheduling, and power allocation for hierarchical cellular systems",2012,"The idea of cognitive radio (CR) has embodied concretely in hierarchical cellular systems by deploying an underlying microcellular system to reuse the underutilized spectrum licensed by an macrocellular system. The fundamental challenges for successfully realizing such hierarchical systems are to manage the intercell interference between the macrocell and microcell and to pursue the goal of maximizing the spectrum recycling efficiency. In this paper, we jointly consider antenna beamforming, power allocation, and multiuser scheduling for the microcellular system to opportunistically utilize the uplink spectrum of the macrocell and to concurrently serve multiple secondary users in the downlink. With the objective of maximizing the sum rate, the three-dimensional joint design problem is often formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) which is an NP-hard problem and very complicated to solve. We resort to semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to convert to the cumbersome optimization problem into a convex problem by introducing an interference-related auxiliary variable. An iterative algorithm based on semidefinite programming is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. The zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the singular value decomposition (SVD)-based beamforming with the best scheduling are simulated for performance comparisons, and our simulation shows that the proposed scheme is much superior to the ZF scheme and quite close to the SVD scheme with a slight performance gap of 1 bps/Hz."
353820,20178,8228,AppRAN: Application-oriented radio access network sharing in mobile networks,2015,"As a promising way to increase network capacity and reduce expenses, radio access network (RAN) sharing among mobile (virtual) network operators, has attracted extensive recent attention from both industry and academia. Meanwhile, mobile systems are undergoing fast evolution to virtualized infrastructure so as to tackle the ever-growing mobile traffic and the unremitting demand for high data rates. However, existing RAN sharing models intend to expose resource details, e.g., infrastructure and spectrum, to participating network operators of the RAN for resource-sharing purposes, which violates the principles of network abstraction and makes network management even more complicated. This paper presents AppRAN, an applicationoriented framework for RAN sharing in mobile networks, which decouples network operators from radio resource by providing application-level services with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee. AppRAN defines a serial of abstract applications with distinct QoS requirements and periodically computes applicationlevel resource allocation for each radio element at a central controller w.r.t. traffic demands and average channel condition. The radio elements are allowed to independently determine flow-level resource allocation within each application afterwards. We formulate the application-level resource allocation as an optimization problem and develop a fast algorithm to solve it with a provably approximate guarantee. The efficacy of AppRAN is validated through theoretical analysis and computer simulations. We show that AppRAN is in line with the design of software-defined RAN."
2307785,20178,369,Distributed Turbo Coding in the Presence of Inter-User Channel Impairment,2009,"We propose a Distributed Turbo Coding (DTC) scheme, where two users cooperate in a two-phase cooperation scenario constituted by the exchange of data between the users in the first phase followed by the uplink transmission of the two users' data in the second phase of cooperation. Following the information exchange phase, the data transmitted from the second user's transmitter during the second phase is an inter- leaved version of the first user's data. Each user's transmitter is equipped with a Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) code, an interleaver and a Sphere Packing (SP) mapper. At the receiver side, interference cancellation is employed, which outputs two branches of decoded data corresponding to the data transmitted from the two users' transmitters. Iterative detection is employed by exchanging extrinsic information between the RSC decoder and the SP demapper in each decoding branch, as well as between the RSC decoders in the two branches. The proposed DTC scheme is benchmarked against another cooperative scheme, where the two users do not exchange their data, they rather transmit their data simultaneously. At the receiver of the bench- mark scheme, iterative detection is carried out by exchanging extrinsic information between the SP demapper and the RSC decoder of each user, but no iterations are invoked between the RSC decoders in the two branches. The proposed scheme attains an Eb/N0 gain of about 25 dB at BER of 10 �5 ,w hen compared to the benchmark scheme, while considering a perfect Inter-User Channel (IUC) and employing Isys=5 system iterations in conjunction with an interleaver depth of Dint=80,000 bits. Additionally, we study the effects of both Gaussian as well as Ricean IUC on the achievable BER performance of the uplink DTC scheme."
2451530,20178,369,Design and Implementation of A Lightweight Brokering System for Content/Service Charging in a Cellular Network Centric Business Model,2007,"Cellular operators offer voice services for years and own a solid amount of users with a certain authority on running cellular business. Recently, various fascinated value added contents and services are emerging in the post-voice era. To extend the business and leverage the exiting operation and maintenance systems, operators strive to become a trusty broker that aggregates a variety of valued added services provided by lots of third-party service/content providers as well as a payment agency that collects the service/content fees into a unified bill for users. In the past, little studies had ever clearly and deeply revealed for how to practically substantiate a lightweight system for connecting users, cellular operators and content/service providers by highly exploiting the mature cellular environment to achieve a triple-win situation. In this article, we elaborate a well- constructed A.A.A. brokering system sitting between the content/service providers and users to link the value chain in such a triple-play game - A 4 BS, which generalizes certain basic mechanisms that govern authentication, authorization, advice-of- charge issuing, accounting, billing and settlement. Through this tried-and-true system, content/service providers can focus on service creation without much attention to the end-user billing. Meanwhile, users can be charged on a transaction basis with an instant expenditure notification and have a one-stop payment in a single cellular bill as well."
793706,20178,369,A Geometrical Channel Model for MIMO Mobile-to-Mobile Fading Channels in Cooperative Networks,2009,"This paper deals with the modeling and analysis of narrowband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mobile- to-mobile (M2M) fading channels in relay-based cooperative networks. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation conditions are assumed in the transmission links from the source mobile station to the destination mobile station via the mobile relay. A stochastic narrowband MIMO M2M reference channel model is derived from the geometrical three-ring scattering model, where it is assumed that an infinite number of local scatterers surround the source mobile station, the mobile relay, and the destination mobile station. The complex channel gains associated with the new reference channel model are derived and their temporal as well as spatial correlation properties are explored. General analytical solutions are presented for the four-dimensional (4-D) space- time cross-correlation function (CCF), the three-dimensional spatial CCF, the two-dimensional (2-D) transmit (relay, receive) correlation function (CF), and the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF). Closed-formed expressions for different CCFs under isotropic scattering conditions are also provided in this paper. The proposed reference channel model can be used as a starting point to develop stochastic and deterministic channel simulators. Such channel simulators are not only important for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the MIMO M2M channel capacity but also for the development of future MIMO M2M cooperative communication systems.

410117,20178,8228,Multimedia Traffic Placement under 5G radio access techniques in indoor environments,2015,"It is a challenge to support multimedia services with high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for upcoming 5G radio access techniques that has the characteristics of Heterogeneous network Architecture, Heterogeneous Terminals and Heterogeneous Spectrum (H3ATS). Multi-view Video (MVV) consisting of multiple video streams captured by close spaced cameras is increasingly popular, permitting changeable viewpoints by playing different streams. As those close spaced cameras will capture overlapping frames (OFs) and transmit OFs in multiple streams, when switching video streams from one to another, it is redundant to transmit and receive OFs in the latter stream for base stations and users, respectively. Moreover, since the data rate requirement of a MVV with multiple streams is much higher than that of the traditional video with single-stream, base stations will consume tremendous bandwidth if the number of playing MVVs increases. To eliminate OFs and offload traffic from base stations, we propose a new MVV stream architecture called Overlapping Reduced Multi-view Video Transmission (ORMVVT) and a new network architecture named Multicast Multi-Traffic Source (MMTS) for multicast small cell networks (MSCNs). Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the data rate of small cells under QoS constraint. An Offloading Based Traffic Placement (OBTP) scheme is introduced to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity OBTP is able to get a higher performance than the traditional schemes in terms of bandwidth saving."
2349800,20178,369,Symbol Time Synchronization Based on SINR Maximization for OFDM,2009,"This work presents a symbol time (ST) synchroniza- tion algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems based on a metric of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) which drops drastically with the increasing ST error. The ST is intuitively estimated by maximizing the SINR metric that exploits the correlation results of the separated-by-N samples. Unlike most existing techniques considering only AWGN or time-invariant multipath channels, the proposed maximum-SINR (MSINR) technique considers the time-variant multipath chan- nels. Compared with conventional techniques, the proposed MSINR technique is less sensitive to the carrier frequency offset and doubly-selective channel effects. knowledge of the Doppler frequency shift which is hard to accurately obtain in practice. Unlike previous works that mainly consider only AWGN or static channel conditions, this letter deals with the ST syn- chronization by maximizing a SINR metric under time-variant multipath channels. The SINR metric exploits the correlation results of the separated-by-N samples. Besides, the knowledge of the Doppler frequency shift is not required for the proposed maximum-SINR (MSINR) technique. In contrast to conven- tional CP-based algorithms which are sensitive to multipath channels, the proposed MSINR technique can effectively re- duce the ST synchronization error even in time-variant multi- path channels. However, the MSINR technique relies on the information of the channel delay spread; therefore, it is further modified to a more practical algorithm which is independent of the channel delay spread. In addition, the modified MSINR algorithm can identify the complete range of ISI-free region available in an OFDM symbol which is another advantage of the modified MSINR algorithm. This capability can be used to improve the BER performance of the system by adjusting the frequency-domain interpolation filter bandwidth. Moreover, the proposed MSINR technique is shown to be insensitive to the carrier frequency offset (CFO)."
742746,20178,369,Association and Deployment Considerations in Dense Wireless LANs,2014,"Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard are one of the most commonplace indoor wireless access solutions. As the ever growing demand for data consumption necessitates higher rates and volumes, it is fairly common to observe more and more WLANs being deployed in close proximity to each other. As distances between WLAN installations diminish, the access points (APs) and stations (STAs) in these WLANs create a complex interference environment, which is also compounded by the indoor propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate the impact of two important parameters related to the deployment and operation of densely deployed wireless LANs on the aggregate throughput obtained by all the nodes in these WLANs. The first such operational parameter we investigate is access point and user station association; namely, whether STAs associate with a random strong AP or the AP from which they obtain the strongest received power. The second operational parameter we consider is the way in which APs are placed in the indoor environment; namely, whether APs are deployed randomly or in a manner to reduce inter-AP interference. In order to account for the complex node interactions in the MAC layer, which is crucial for accurate performance estimation, we perform packet-level simulations using OPNET. Our results show that the type of node association used in densely deployed WLANs has a critical impact on the aggregate throughput. In comparison, the type of AP deployment used is not nearly as significant; varying from moderate to no impact at all."
2005882,20178,369,Multimedia over 802.15.4 and ZigBee Networks for Ambient Environment Control,2007,"WPAN technologies such as IEEE 802.15.4 have been introduced to allow for energy-efficient communication of control and sensor data. In certain application areas, it is beneficial to leverage such a wireless control network to transfer multimedia data. A concrete example is a wireless cabin control network, which is deployed to control the ambient environment (light, sound, climate etc.) of a vehicle cabin (such as a bus, a train or an aircraft). Therefore, in this paper we introduce a distinct system architecture, called Ambient Multimedia ZigBee Service Environment (AMuZE) for WPANs and describe the results of performance evaluations achieved by simulations in an experimental test-bed. We demonstrate that it is possible to use an IEEE 802.15.4 networks to broadcast voice messages (e.g. for instructions in case of emergencies) as well as continuous sound streams (e.g. to create ubiquitous ambient sound environments), while at the same time control functions are performed with high reliability. For the control of the ambient lighting, video image transfer has been integrated to enable an optical feedback channel for auto-configuration of the system. The performance evaluation has been carried out by integrating the embedded device code into an event driven simulation framework. This approach allows for a realistic assessment of the performance in the simulation. As an asset, the optimized algorithms may be transferred directly to the target devices. Finally, results from the validation of the proposed concept in an experimental test-bed are presented"
2874584,20178,10228,On the orchestration of robust virtual LTE-U networks from hybrid half/full-duplex Wi-Fi APs,2016,"Two promising solutions have been recently proposed to address the massive growth in mobile traffic and wireless devices: LTE-U and in-band full-duplex (FD) wireless. LTE-U extends the benefits of LTE-A to the unlicensed 5 GHz band, used mainly by Wi-Fi users. However, the uncertainty in Wi-Fi user activities makes provisioning QoS guarantees to LTE-U users challenging. On the other hand, FD wireless can double spectrum efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception over the same frequency band. Our objective in this paper is to exploit excess capacity of deployed Wi-Fi networks (operating in the 5 GHz band) to orchestrate a ‘robust’ virtual LTE-U network from a hybrid set of half-duplex (HD) and FD Wi-Fi access points (APs). Although the orchestrated LTE-U network does not support deterministic QoS guarantees, it is designed to provide prespecified probabilistic QoS guarantees (hence, it is robust). Towards achieving our goal, we develop novel stochastic resource allocation formulations that optimally orchestrate a virtual LTE-U network from a hybrid set of HD/FD APs with the minimum cost. We first consider the single small-cell problem and propose a stochastic formulation, which we refer to as CCLTEU single . Then, we study the multi-cell stochastic allocation problem and develop another formulation, which we refer to as CCLTEU multi . Our formulations adopt a ‘chance-constrained stochastic programming’ approach. We derive the deterministic equivalent programs of CCLTEU single  and CCLTEU multi  and evaluate them numerically under various system parameters."
2498197,20178,369,Enhancing Coverage and Reducing Power Consumption in Peer-to-Peer Networks Through Airborne Relaying,2007,"Over the years peer-to-peer (P2P) multi-hop relays have been studied for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) to overcome poor signal coverage and to improve connectivity. However, for an urban environment, particularly with a sparse mobile distribution, a ground relay is not able to achieve significant benefits, mainly due to the extremely high pathloss and shadowing encountered. Dedicated airborne relay nodes, at a height of hundreds or thousands of meters, can provide much better coverage, and hence improve the connectivity, decrease the number of hops, reduce the power consumption, and support co-operative relays when integrated into mobile ad-hoc networks. An air node can also act as the sink for current wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Despite these potential advantages, the coverage from an air node located directly above an urban operating environment has not been adequately investigated in the literature. This paper compares the advantages of airborne relaying compared to more conventional peer-to-peer mobile relays. Three channel types are considered, i.e. line-of-sight (LoS), obstructed LoS (OLoS), and non-LoS (NLoS), each with their own likelihood, pathloss, and shadowing models. The practical gain pattern of a hemispheric antenna, or a directional antenna, is also carefully considered for the air node. Comparisons of the air-to-ground (A2G) channel and the mobile P2P channel demonstrate that airborne relays can enhance the coverage and reduce the power consumption significantly."
1841393,20178,369,On the synergy between adaptive physical layer and multiple-access control for integrated voice and data services in a cellular wireless network,2002,"We propose a novel design to exploit the synergy between the multiple-access control (MAC) layer and the physical layer of a cellular wireless system with integrated voice and data services. As in a traditional design, the physical layer (channel encoder and modulator) is responsible for providing error protection for transmitting the packets over the hostile radio channel, while the MAC layer is responsible for allocating the precious bandwidth to the contending users for voice or data connections. However, a distinctive feature of our proposed design is that in the physical layer, a variable-rate adaptive channel encoder is employed to dynamically adjust the amount of forward error correction according to the time-varying wireless channel state such that the MAC layer, which is a reservation-based time-division multiple-access protocol, is able to make informed decisions as to bandwidth allocation. Specifically, based on the channel state information provided by the physical layer, the MAC protocol gives higher priority to users with better channel states. This novel synergistic mechanism between the two protocol layers can utilize the system bandwidth more effectively. The multiple-access performance of the proposed scheme is compared with two baseline systems. The first baseline system consists of the same reservation-based MAC protocol but with a traditional fixed-rate physical layer. The second system consists of the same reservation-based MAC protocol and the same channel adaptive physical layer, but without interaction between the two layers. All three protocols have a request queue, which stores the previous requests that survive the contention but are not allocated information slots. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains are achieved through the exploitation of the synergy between the two protocol layers."
2115877,20178,369,Joint link quality and power management over wireless networks with fairness constraint and space-time diversity,2004,"In multiaccess wireless networks, dynamic allocation of resource such as link qualities and transmitted powers is an important means to combat time-varying fading environments and cochannel interferences (CCIs). In most prior work, every link's quality is maintained by having a fixed signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) requirement. We discover that such a constraint is too strong and can degrade the performance of entire wireless networks, because a user with a bad channel response requires too much transmitted power and, therefore, causes unnecessary CCI to other users. In this paper, we alleviate this constraint and explore the time and multiuser diversity. For each user, the time-average link quality is maintained as a constant to ensure fairness. For the whole system, we want to minimize the overall transmitted power. In order to solve this problem, each user provides the system with a SINR range that is acceptable, according to the channel conditions and transmission history. Then, the system allocates the resources according to these ranges, channel conditions, and other practical constraints. Each time, some users may sacrifice their performances to reduce the overall network transmitted power. These users' temporary sacrifices will improve the system performance and will be paid back in the long term. This scheme can be conceived of as water filling the wireless network resources to different users at different times. In addition, by combining the proposed scheme with beamforming, we can have one more degree of freedom to combat CCIs in different directions of arrivals and different channel conditions over time."
394545,20178,369,Analysis and Implementation of the Semi-Global Matching 3D Vision Algorithm Using Code Transformations and High-Level Synthesis,2015,"High-level synthesis (HLS) offers several advantages, such as faster simulation run-time and better design re-use, thanks to the higher level of abstraction. This work uses HLS to implement the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm, which is frequently used in stereo vision systems, e.g. for automotive applications. The hardware implementation is based on a Xilinx&#x00AE; Virtex 7 FPGA. The initial algorithmic golden model used very large arrays, which had to be mapped to an external DRAM and brought into the on-chip RAM of the FPGA on demand. This required both adding the memory transfer loops and inserting calls to the AXI transactors that access the DRAM through the on-chip DDR slave. Moreover, the initial single- threaded algorithm had to be parallelized, by converting the top-level sweeps of the image in eight directions into as many threads. The access to the DRAM was then managed with a centralized controller. This modified SystemC design proved to be suitable to achieve the target real-time performance. The design space was thus explored by making several fairly different micro- architectural choices. In the end, it was possible to obtain an implementation which is comparable to a very efficient (and hence very inflexible) manual RTL design that had been previously developed, including a very sophisticated fine- grained management of data and computation."
3038860,20178,369,Enabling RAN Moderation and Dynamic Traffic Steering in 5G,2016,"The exponential increase in capacity and data rate demands, along with the diversification of use cases and verticals that are planning to use cellular radio access networks (RANs) to provide connectivity, has prompted the development of the fifth generation (5G) of radio access technology. Traffic steering, which aims at optimum mapping of the data flows to the appropriate RAN access points (APs), is considered to be one of the key enablers for supporting diverse set of requirements ranging from 1000 times higher capacity than 2010 figures to 99.999 % reliability. Furthermore, to constrain power consumption due to the ultra-densification of the network in 5G, enhanced mechanisms are required that can exploit multi-connectivity. In this paper, we build upon the envisioned connectivity provided through multiple radio links and provide schemes to enable dynamic traffic steering and energy-efficient RAN moderation in 5G. First, we present the various protocol options for tight integration of long-term evolution (LTE) and 5G networks. We then investigate how faster traffic steering over the multiple radio links can be enabled, which can both reduce the packet delivery time by increasing the capacity and reliability, and also reduce the power consumption of the network through efficient operation.

2207821,20178,369,Experiments on three-step fast cell search algorithm employing common pilot channel for OFCDM broadband packet wireless access in forward link,2004,"This paper presents laboratory and field experimental results on a three-step cell search algorithm employing the time-multiplexed common pilot channel (CPICH) for orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing (OFCDM) broadband wireless access with a 100-MHz bandwidth. In the proposed three-step cell search method using a two-dimensional cell-specific scrambling code, the OFCDM symbol timing, packet frame timing and scrambling code group, and the scrambling code within the group are detected by taking advantage of the CPICH in the first, second, and third step, respectively (note that the packet data channel (PDCH) is also used in the first step). The laboratory experimental results using a multipath fading simulator show that the cell detection probability of 90% is achieved within approximately 4 and 26 msec when the average received signal energy per symbol-to-background noise power spectrum density ratio (E/sub b//N/sub 0/) of the PDCH is -2 and -5 dB, respectively, where the maximum Doppler frequency is 20 to 400 Hz and the root mean squared delay spread is 0.1 to 0.6 /spl mu/sec. Furthermore, field experimental results with the carrier frequency of 4.635 GHz show that the cell search time at the detection probability of 90% is approximately 10 msec in a course that is 800 to 1000 meters away from the cell site, even with the transmission power of the time-multiplexed CPICH (PDCH) of 0.06 W (0.13 W)."
1637928,20178,369,Range and Bearing Estimation for Near-Field Sources,2010,"Most of the array signal processing methods for the estimation of the direction of arrival angle estimation (DOA) for multiple incident sources are based on the far-field assumption. When the sources are located close to the antenna array, these methods are no longer valid. In this paper, a new method is presented for the joint range and DOA estimation for multiple near-field sources. The proposed method proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we construct the Toeplitz matrix using only the second-order statistics and employ rank revealing QR factorization (RRQR) to estimate the DOA. In the second step, we reconstruct the Toeplitz matrix from the collection data only which is equivalent to first-order statistics and employ the RRQR to estimate the range. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed schemes provide several advantages. First, the computation of RRQR for Toeplitz matrix require O(n2) whereas the existing schemes requiring eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or singular value decomposition (SVD) for an cross spectral matrix. However using SVD or EVD require much more computational complexity O(n3). Second, the proposed method is more suitable for high speed communication since it requires second or first order statistics and a single snapshot. However, the existing method involves multidimensional research or high order statistics which increase the complexity and computational load further. Third, the proposed method does not require any pair matching for the range and DOA for multiple sources. The simulation results verify that the proposed method provide good performance with less computational complexity."
2262474,20178,369,Performance of downlink eigenbeamformer with realistic feedback transmission,2001,"Several closed-loop transmitter diversity concepts for multiple antennas are currently under discussion for inclusion in the 3GPP W-CDMA standard. The focus is to find a concept using 4 transmitter antennas allowing for finer beamsteering while still being compatible with the current uplink feedback rate of one bit per transmission slot. Among these concepts, the downlink eigenbeamformer effectively uses long-term as well as short-term channel properties. More specifically, it is based on an eigenanalysis of the long-term spatial covariance matrix. The eigenbeams with the largest eigenvalues (largest average SNR) are determined and fed back step by step to the base station (BS). This process takes place on the same time scale as the mobile station's (MS) physical movement. Accordingly, required operations in the MS as well as required long-term feedback bits are distributed over a very large number of transmission slots. In addition, a short term selection between the eigenbeams is carried out at the MS to account for fast fading. Performance in terms of coded block error rate for the downlink eigenbeamformer concept is analysed under a set of spatial channel models. Simulation results show the influence of important parameters like, e.g., the amount of common pilot channel power compared to another transmitter diversity proposal that does not exploit the long term channel statistics. The multiplexing formats between long-term and short-term feedback information are discussed and a detailed complexity analysis is given."
1820181,20178,369,Performance Analysis of Distributed Antenna System for High Building Wireless Communication,2011,"In wireless systems, coverage and capacity is a major challenge especially in high buildings. The system performance is impaired by co-channel interference due to the need to reuse the limited available spectrum in neighbouring floors. In this environment, distributed antenna systems (DASs) can provide adequate coverage and high speed data services in the presence of multipath fading and co-channel interference by optimally combining the same signal from several antennas. This paper proposes a DAS for uplink transmission in high-rise buildings; where remote antenna units (RAUs) are deployed on each floor so as to reduce the access distance while at the same time exploiting spatial diversity. The RAUs are connected to a central unit (CU) where received signals are processed. To analyse the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system with diversity reception, Nakagami/Rayleigh fading channel is assumed for different building geometries and a propagation channel model for in-building propagation is developed based on multiple floor in-building path loss values retrieved from measurement data. This model accounts for the propagation between different floors and ceilings and includes possible reflections from surrounding buildings. The effects of different numbers of receive antennas per floor and deployment conditions are investigated. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme provides improved BER performance, leading to many more simultaneous users being supported on the same frequency in high buildings when compared with a system with a single antenna per floor."
746983,20178,369,Joint Energy-Efficient Single Relay Selection and Power Allocation for Analog Network Coding with Three Transmission Phases,2014,"The multiple access broadcast (MABC) is an effective two phases transmission (2P) ANC protocol for the half-duplex (HD) communication mode. However, MABC does not make use of channel gain of the direct link (DL) no matter how strong it is. On the other hand, the time division broadcast (TDBC) is known as a three phases transmission (3P) protocol which enables transceivers to utilize DL and thus offers the possibility to achieve higher performance compared with the MABC at the expense of a reduced spectral efficiency due to the one extra transmission phase. In this paper, we investigate a joint single relay selection and power allocation schemes for energy-efficient wireless communication systems with analog network coding (ANC) for TDBC, where two-way relay channel with two end nodes and N parallel relay nodes is considered under an assumption of perfect channel-state information (CSI). Our objective is to minimize the total system transmit power consumption under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for TDBC protocol with joint single relay selection and nodes power allocation. In addition, a zero-forcing based relay signal combining technique that combines the signals received at the 1st and 2nd transmission phases, also known as zero-forcing relay power allocation (ZF-RPA), is also investigated. Numerical simulation shows that the traditional VG-RPA is more energy-efficient than the ZF-RPA scheme for TDBC in cases with and without utilizing DL."
1223860,20178,369,Proximity-Based Data Offloading via Network Assisted Device-to-Device Communications,2013,"Analysts predict explosive growth in traffic demand on mobile broadband systems over the coming years due to the popularity of streaming video, gaming, and other social media services. While 4G wireless technologies are making a significant effort to keep up with this demand, the expectation is that cellular deployments will fall short of the required capacity unless there is a dramatic shift towards smaller cells. There is already significant interest in femto- and pico-cell deployments for this reason. However, there is another method of creating small cells that the wireless industry has yet to capitalize on, namely direct connectivity between clients in close proximity. 3GPP is currently working to enable device-to-device (D2D) communications within Release 12 of LTE-Advanced. By comparison, IEEE has already defined a D2D communications protocol, termed WiFi Direct, which is based on the 802.11 standards. WiFi Direct not only serves to offload user data onto direct links, but does so using the unlicensed bands. To benefit users further, WiFi Direct can be enhanced by enabling the LTE network to assist during peer discovery and direct connection establishment. In this paper, we discuss the network/client requirements and performance benefits of network-assisted WiFi Direct. We assume that clients are continuously under management by the LTE network, which assists them with service/peer discovery and direct connection establishment. We show that network-assisted WiFi Direct can significantly improve the performance of proximal applications and reduce the power consumed by the clients involved, while also improving capacity of the LTE network."
2209988,20178,369,Field Experiments on Ultimate Frequency Efficiency Exceeding 30 Bit/Second/Hz Using MLD Signal Detection in MIMO-OFDM Broadband Packet Radio Access,2007,"This paper presents indoor and field experimental results on extremely high-speed packet transmissions of 4.92 Gbps in a 100-MHz channel bandwidth, i.e., the frequency efficiency of approximately 50 bit/second/Hz, in the downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio access. The required received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is less than 30 dB, which approaches the almost upper limit in cellular environments near a cell site even with a light channel load, with the aim of the application to future universal broadband packet radio access. We apply 12-by-12 MIMO multiplexing using the maximum likelihood detection employing QR decomposition and the M-algorithm (QRM-MLD) with adaptive selection of the surviving symbol replica candidates (ASESS), 64QAM data modulation, and turbo coding with the coding rate of R = 8/9 to achieve an extremely high frequency efficiency level. In the field experiments conducted in the Yokosuka Research Park (YRP) district of Yokosuka city, we show that the measured throughput of 4.92 Gbps is achieved at the average received SNR per receiver antenna of approximately 28.0 and 28.5 dB when the receiver antenna spacing is 40 cm (6.2lambda), and 10 cm (1.5lambda) at the average speed of 10 km/h, respectively."
1904653,20178,369,Resource allocation for multiple classes of DS-CDMA traffic,2000,"We consider a packet data direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) system which supports integrated services. The services are partitioned into different traffic classes according to information rate (bandwidth) and quality of service (QoS) requirements. Given sufficient bandwidth, QoS requirements can be satisfied by an appropriate assignment of transmitted power and processing gain to users in each class. The effect of this assignment is analyzed for both a single class of data users and two classes of voice and data users. For a single class of data users, we examine the relationship between average delay and processing gain, assuming that ARQ with forward error correction is used to guarantee reliability. The only channel impairment considered is interference, which is modeled as Gaussian noise. A fixed user population is assumed and two models for generation of data packets are considered: (1) each user generates a new packet as soon as the preceding packet is successfully delivered and (2) each user generates packets according to a Poisson process. In each case, the packets enter a buffer which is emptied at the symbol rate. For the second traffic model, lowering the processing gain below a threshold can produce multiple operating points, one of which corresponds to infinite delay. The choice of processing gain which minimizes average delay in that case is the smallest processing gain at which multiple operating points are avoided. Two classes of users (voice/data and two data classes) are then considered. Numerical examples are presented which illustrate, the increase in the two-dimensional (2-D) capacity region achievable by optimizing the assignment of powers and processing gains to each class."
2177210,20178,369,Mobile WiMAX: Performance Analysis and Comparison with Experimental Results,2008,"The demand for broadband mobile services continues to grow. Conventional high-speed broadband solutions are based on wired-access technologies such as digital subscriber line (DSL). This type of solution is difficult to deploy in remote rural areas, and furthermore it lacks support for terminal mobility. Mobile broadband wireless access (BWA) offers a flexible and cost-effective solution to these problems. In recent years the WiMax standard has emerged to harmonise the wide variety of different BWA technologies. The first WiMax version was based on the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard and offered wireless links to fixed subscribers. The most recent 802.16e standard supports broadband applications to mobile handsets and laptops. This paper analyses the performance of a mobile WiMAX system operating on all link-speeds in an urban microcell. The simulation results are generated using a fully compliant 802.16e simulator and cover important aspects such as link adaptation, packet error rate and throughput. The theory is supported by experimental data captured in an urban microcell environment using a mobile WiMax basestation. Predicted results are compared with measured data taken from a number of vehicular drive tests. Analysis shows that mobile WiMax is able to achieve a street-level range of 300-2100 m depending on the permitted EIRP level."
1174293,20178,369,An Extensible Distributed Measurement Platform for Analyzing Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of Multimedia Applications over Wireless Networks,2012,"With rapid advancement of 3G wireless network technology, mobile Internet access is becoming more and more popular in recent years, and web access by mobile phones even surpassed that by other means. Users' level of satisfaction of services based on such rapidly developing technology immediately becomes an important issue. The distributed QoS (Quality of Service) / QoE (Quality of Experience) measurement platform proposed here solves this problem by offering network engineers capability to monitor network service quality and the likely QoE as experienced by phone users while watching streaming videos, for purposes like benchmarking and tracking down problematic cells. There are three major components of the proposed system: (1) client program; (2) backend server; and (3) web interface. The client program runs on Android smartphones. Using the various equipped hardware sensors, radio information, location information and network statistics, etc., are collected. By exploiting the mobility of smartphones, data can be collected wherever the phone is located. Those data are uploaded to the backend server for data aggregation and processing. In particular, a QoE computation algorithm recommended by ITU is used to convert raw data into QoE scores. To facilitate easy access to the general network service quality, a versatile web interface is also implemented to give detailed information of individual data collection sessions."
1091089,20178,369,Experimental Evaluation of Reference Signal Interference Canceller for Multi-BS Cooperative Transmission Control in LTE,2012,"Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) is attracting attention recently. In ICIC, mutual interference among cells are coordinated to mitigate strong interference to UEs, while the exchange of data signal is not necessary among eNBs, which results in lower signal processing and networking burdens compared to coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission. In ICIC, the interference from an eNB to UEs in surrounding cells can be mitigated by stopping signal transmission (muting) on some time or frequency radio resources. However, even when the data signal transmission is stopped, common signals such as reference signal (RS) continue to be transmitted in LTE systems. Therefore, UEs still receive the residual interference from the RS, which degrades the performance. To solve this issue, we proposed an RS interference canceller. Because the RS is a common signal, the signal can be detected and removed (cancelled) by any UE. We evaluated the effect of the canceller by computer simulation and clarified that it yields improved performance in the simple single-input single-output (SISO) antenna configuration. In this paper, we extended the canceller to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna configuration. We also propose a frequency-domain interference canceller, which drastically reduces signal processing cost without degrading performance. Furthermore, we implement the proposed canceller on 3GPP Release 8 LTE UE and conduct an experimental evaluation. The results demonstrate that the proposed canceller gives high performance improvement even with actual equipment."
2634200,20178,369,Real-Life Indoor MIMO Performance with Ultra-Compact LTE Nodes,2015,"With the ever increasing demand for mobile broadband service with very high bitrates to indoor users, there is large industry traction around different types of In Building Solutions (IBS) for Long Term Evolution (LTE). Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a key feature in LTE enabling significantly improved user bitrates, and the indoor channel characteristics are also expected to be in favor for MIMO performance. Despite this, due to deployment constraints and design constraints on the IBS antenna design and size, many IBS deployments of today do not support MIMO. As the market evolves, this is finally changing and in this paper, the 2x2 MIMO performance is measured in real-life with small-size radio equipment, a commercial smartphone and a low-power radio head, both with a size of approximately a wavelength. Despite the small antennas, the performance is found to be very good supporting rank-2 transmission on almost the whole 2500 m² office floor with only 100 mW transmission power. In more than half of the area, the user bitrate exceeds the maximum rank-1 bitrate, demonstrating the value of MIMO. Also in Line-Of-Sight (LOS) conditions, traditionally a weakness for MIMO performance, the indoor channel richness facilitates rank-2 transmission. The 2x2 MIMO performance is found to be limited rather by propagation loss than MIMO channel characteristics and antenna size, which demonstrates the potential for ultra-compact 2x2 MIMO indoor antenna heads."
255376,20178,369,Multi-Leader Stackelberg Games in Multi-Channel Spatial Aloha Networks,2015,"This paper uses a multi-channel spatial Aloha model to describe a distributed autonomous wireless network where a group of transmit-receive pairs (users) share multiple collision channels via slotted-Aloha-like random access. The design objective is to enable each autonomous user i to select a channel c_i and decide a medium access probability (MAP) q_i to improve its throughput, while providing a certain degree of fairness among the users. Game theoretic approaches are applied, where each user i is a player who chooses the strategy (c_i,q_i) to improve its own throughput. To search for a Nash Equilibrium (NE), a Multi-Leader Stackelberg Game (MLSG) is formulated to iteratively obtain a solution on each dimension of the (c_i,q_i) strategy. Initially, multiple Stackelberg leaders are elected to manage the MAPs of all players. Then under the resulting MAP profile, each player iteratively chooses its channel to improve its throughput. An Oscillation Resolving Mechanism (ORM) is further proposed to stabilize the design in some special cases where the operating points of some players in a local region would oscillate between the two dimensions of the myopic search. Compared to existing methods of pre-allocating MAPs, the MLSG game further improves the overall network throughput by iteratively tuning the MAPs toward max-min throughput in each subnet. Simulation results show that the MLSG game gradually improves the total throughput until reaching a NE, which also provides good throughput fairness for the players."
682599,20178,369,Markov-History Based Modeling for Realistic Mobility of Vehicles in VANETs,2013,"Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) can be considered as complex dynamic systems where simulation modeling plays a crucial role in conducting research due to the difficulties in the realization of such a network, like high costs, risks and dangers. During the last decade, the results of VANET simulations were considered successful and acceptable however, most prior VANET simulators were based on non realistic mobility when describing node positions, distribution, frequency and movement, model paths, traffic signals etc. To deal with this challenge, we propose in this paper a Markov-History based modeling for realistic mobility of vehicles in VANETs. It starts with a geographic area digitization, followed by a vehicle positions initialization. The proposed model predicts directions of the vehicles using a Markov chain, as well as it predicts the vehicle velocities using a History-based sub-model. Moreover, the density of the network is updated according to the peak or off-peak hours. The emerged model can be used as mobility model to simulate VANET scenarios. To validate our proposal, a concrete mobility model has been designed using the proposed model that represents the downtown of Biskra City located in Algeria. The performances of the resulting network have been proved against the others obtained using Random Waypoint as a standard mobility model in terms of packet delivery ratio, network overhead, average end-to-end delay, and dropped packets."
603202,20178,369,Direction of arrival of radio signals inside and outside buildings,1994,"In the design of UHF radio systems for mobile and personal communications the characteristics of the RF channel present problems. Scattering, diffraction, refraction and reflection by the structure of buildings leads to multipath propagation. This in turn leads to distortion of the signals transmitted over the radio channel. It is therefore of interest to investigate the sources of the multipath propagation. The paper reports measurements made at 870 MHz inside the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering building and around the campus at the University of Leeds. The measurement system uses a synthetic aperture phased array antenna to measure directions of arrival in azimuth and elevation. The directions an deduced using normal beamforming methods and the high resolution MUSIC method. The measurements show the effects of reflection, diffraction, and guiding of signals by the structure of the building. Signals are guided by corridors within the building and the direction of arrival of signals transmitted from one floor to another may be by way of the corridors and stairwells rather than by penetration through the floor. Outside the building reflections from the walls of buildings play a large part in the transmission of the signals. The result is that the major components of signal received at a particular point may come from a direction very different to the direction of the geometrical line from transmitter to receiver. The use of high resolution signal processing makes the identification of the individual multipath components much clearer as is shown. >"
2125418,20178,369,Prefiltered Low Complexity Tree Detection for Frequency Selective Fading Channels,2007,"We target M-ary data sequence estimation over time-variant frequency selective fading channels. Recently, we proposed a low complexity breadth first tree detector, termed improved M-algorithm (IMA). Unlike the M-algorithm (MA), it takes the whole energy of the received symbol of the current step into account when choosing survivors. Unknown future symbols overlap with postcursors of the current symbol and are modelled as additive Gaussian noise in the metric. Thus, unlike the standard MA, IMA works well without an energy compacting front end prefilter (FEP) even in frequency-selective channels, whereas a FEP is crucial for ordinary reduced state sequence estimators such as the delayed decision feedback sequence estimator (DDFSE) and reduced state sequence estimator (RSSE). However, although not explicitly needed, we show that the complexity of IMA can be reduced even more applying a FEP, because the first channel tap has increased energy, and the effective channel would be even shorter, so that the influence of future symbols on the postcursors is smaller, enabling the tree detector to chose the paths through the tree more precisely. We propose to make use of the cepstrum to compute the FEP via a minimum phase target impulse response. We use the GSM/EDGE modulation format here, in order to enable other researchers to compare their results. Simulation results indicate that for the given application, IMA is superior to RSSE with similar complexity."
1914577,20178,8228,On SC/FDE Block Transmission with Reduced Cyclic Prefix Assistance,2006,"For conventional CP-assisted (Cyclic Prefix) SC/FDE implementations (Single- Carrier/Frequency-Domain Equalization), as well as for OFDM implementations (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), the CP length is known to be selected on the basis of the expected maximum delay spread. Next, the data block size can be chosen to be large enough to minimize the CP overhead, yet small enough to make the channel variation over the block negligible. This paper considers the possibility of reducing the overall CP assistance, when transmitting sequences of SC blocks, while avoiding an excessively long FFT block for FDE purposes and keeping good performances through a moderate increase of the FDE receiver complexity. Firstly, we present an algorithm for a Decision-Directed Correction (DDC) of the FDE inputs when the CP is not long enough to cope with the time-dispersive channel effects. The resulting FDE performance is then evaluated in worst-case (CP-free) conditions, and the impact of previous decisions which are not error-free is shown to be rather small. In the following, we present and evaluate a novel class of reduced-CP SC/FDE schemes, which takes advantage of the DDC algorithm for replacing useless CP redundancy by fully useful channel coding redundancy: highly power/bandwidth efficient block transmission schemes, especially recommendable for both strongly time-dispersive and time-varying channel conditions, are then achieved."
1830226,20178,369,A Traffic Model for the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS),2007,"The IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) could very well be the panacea for most telecom operators. Defined originally as the core network for 3G mobile systems by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the more recent releases have included interfaces to fixed line networks and wireless LANs. British Telecom is embarking on a 10 year long bold endeavor, called the 21st Century Network (21CN), to completely overhaul its core network to one that is based on 3GPP IMS. The ultimate goals are to reduce operational cost and provide converged services to its customers. At the heart of the IMS is the home subscriber server (HSS), the master database that holds all customer profiles. The two main protocols used for session control procedures are the session initiation protocol (SIP) and Diameter. Both are sent in clear text and very heavy weight. Although IMS promises an exciting world of converged services, the sheer amount of signaling traffic could prove to be too costly. Since there are no known large scale IMS networks, a representative signaling traffic model is still unavailable. We, at BT, have defined a signaling traffic model for IMS using the experience we gained through 21CN. The model quantifies the traffic and latency for various procedures defined in IMS, starting from the basic call flows. We present the model in this paper and also compare the IMS traffic with other traditional schemes and make conclusions on its efficiency."
1270756,20178,20649,Resource Efficient Mobile Communications for Crowd-Sensing,2014,"Due to continuously growing communication traffic of emerging mobile phone applications, resource-efficient communication is a key to affordable network services with high Quality of Experience. While some communication traffic requires immediate resource allocations (such as voice services), an increasing number of mobile phone applications produce a lot of background communication traffic (e.g. social network apps, crowd sensing services). In this paper we discuss the predictive Channel-Aware Transmission (pCAT) scheme, which leverages the fact, that favorable channel conditions require much less spectrum resource allocation than bad channel conditions. By leveraging the knowledge of user trajectories and recurring spots with favorable channel conditions, the so-called LTE connectivity hot spots, background traffic transmissions can be scheduled by the client according to expected channel quality and application data priority. Thereby, the spectrum consumption of background traffic of applications can be reduced significantly. At the same time, the efficient usage of spectrum resources has also an impact on the battery lifetime of the mobile devices. By introducing the Context-Aware Power Consumption Model (CoPoMo) for LTE communications, we highlight, how decisions about the spectrum resource allocation by the network will impact the battery lifetime. One case study will show, that by simply changing the resource allocation scheme and without the need for spending more spectrum resources, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 70% using the Energy-Efficient Scheduling (EES) introduced in this paper."
2049122,20178,369,Multiple-Relay Aided Distributed Turbo Coding Assisted Differential Unitary Space-Time Spreading for Asynchronous Cooperative Networks,2010,"This paper proposes a cooperative space-time coding (STC) protocol, amalgamating the concepts of asynchronous cooperation, non-coherent detection as well as Distributed Turbo Coding (DTC), where neither symbol-level time synchronization nor CSI estimation is required at any of the cooperating nodes, while attaining a high performance even at low SNRs. More specifically, a practical cooperative differential space-time spreading (CDSTS) scheme is designed with the aid of interference rejection spreading codes, in order to eliminate the effect of synchronization errors between the relay nodes without the assistance of channel estimation or equalization. Furthermore, a set of space-time codewords are constructed based on Differential Linear Dispersion Codes (DLDC), which allows our CDSTS system to support an arbitrary number of relay nodes operating at a high transmission rate due to its flexible design. Rather than using conventional single-relay-assisted DTCs, novel multi-relay-assisted DTCs and a three-stage iteratively-decoded destination receiver structure are developed. In our simulations the system parameters are designed with the aid of EXIT chart analysis, followed by the characterization of the achievable BER performance for various synchronization delay values as well as for various diversity-multiplexing relationships in frequency-selective fast and/or quasi-static Rayleigh fading environments."
1021522,20178,369,Phone-Radar: Infrastructure-Free Device-to-Device Localization,2014,"In some practical scenarios such as tour guiding and children babysitting, one mobile device held by tour guides or parents need to know the distance and direction of another nearby mobile device held by tourist or children. However, to date, most existing pedestrian localization methods rely on a fixed external infrastructure, such as a global positioning system(GPS) or pre-deployed wifi access points to provide Localization service for mobile devices. Such methods are constrained either by limited GPS coverage or by complicated set-up procedures. We observe that, when two devices are moving, the change of their positions leads to the change of distance between them. Given the same movements, different relative locations between devices lead to different distance changes. Besides, the distance between and relative movement of devices can be measured by two phone-embedded sensors respectively. This motivates us to exploit the relative localization method by merely two mobile devices. In this work, we present Phone-Radar, which is an infrastructure-free device-to-device localization system. According to the propagation model of wireless signals, the change of distance between devices are modeled by the change of wireless signal strength between them. The movements of devices are recorded by the inertial sensors using step-counting method. We further study the relationship among the initial relative locations between the two devices, their relative movements and the change of received signal strength measurements. Moreover, we implement the proposed method and measure its performance under real world conditions. The testbed experiments show the efficiency of our proposed method."
1281703,20178,8228,Multi-cell field trial on a wireless feeder uplink for Small Cells,2013,"It is expected that the ever increasing demand for higher data rates in mobile networks will force operators to deploy denser networks using a large number of additional Small Cells (SCs). However, the identification and deployment of new sites is not an easy and therefore a costly project. A major challenge is the required broadband feeder link of new sites to the backhaul network. At locations where copper and fiber are not available, wireless technologies are the alternative which today works well for line-of-sight (LOS) connections where highly directive antennas can be used. High throughput non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless links, which are in the focus of this work, are much more difficult to deploy because of increased path-loss and channel fading due to moving scatterers which motivate the use of more homogeneous antennas that come along with increased interference. In this paper, we apply joint signal processing of feeding macro cells (MCs) as one potential lever to solve this interference problem. In particular, we report field trial results of a joint detection (JD) feeder uplink in an urban multi-cell testbed. One focus is on multi-cell channel parameters measured at different SC locations and heights, and another on achievable rates for a deployment using up to four antennas at each SC."
2231388,20178,369,Iterative Detection Aided H.264 Wireless Video Telephony Using Irregular Convolutional Codes,2009,"In this paper we evaluate the performance of a Data- Partitioned (DP) H.264 coded video transmission system using Unequal Error Protection (UEP) IrRegular Convolutional Codes (IRCC). Using UEP, perceptually more important bits are provided with more strong protection relative to less important bits. An iterative detection aided combination of IRCC and a rate-1 precoder was used to improve the overall BER performance and to enhance the objective video quality expressed in terms of Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR). The effect of different error protection schemes on the attainable system performance is demonstrated, while keeping the overall bit-rate budget constant for the transmission of DP H.264 source coded video over correlated narrowband Rayleigh fading channels. In this paper we exploited the high design flexibility of IRCCs, which constitutes a family of different rate subcodes, while maintaining an excellent iterative decoding convergence performance. Additionally, due to the use of different-rate subcodes, IRCCs have the capability of providing UEP for the H.264 coded video stream. An EXIT chart matching procedure was used for the design of our specific IRCC. Additionally, EXIT charts were used for analysing the attainable system performance of various error protection schemes employed. Explicitly, our experimental results show that the proposed UEP scheme using IRCC outperforms its Equal Error Protection (EEP) counterpart employing regular convolutional codes by about 0.5 dB Eb/N0 at the PSNR degradation point of 1 dB.

1843733,20178,369,Optimal and Low-Complexity Algorithms for Dynamic Spectrum Access in Centralized Cognitive Radio Networks with Fading Channels,2011,"In this paper, we develop a centralized spectrum sensing and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) scheme for secondary users (SUs) in a Cognitive Radio (CR) network. Assuming that the primary channel occupancy follows a Markovian evolution, the channel sensing problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We assume that each SU can sense only one channel at a time by using energy detection, and the sensing outcomes are then reported to a central unit, called the secondary system decision center (SSDC), that determines the channel sensing/accessing policies. We derive both the optimal channel assignment policy for secondary users to sense the primary channels, and the optimal channel access rule. Our proposed optimal sensing and accessing policies alleviate many shortcomings and limitations of existing proposals: (a) ours allows fully utilizing all available primary spectrum white spaces, (b) our model, and thus the proposed solution, exploits the temporal and spatial diversity across different primary channels, and (c) is based on realistic local sensing decisions rather than complete knowledge of primary signalling structure. As an alternative to the high complexity of the optimal channel sensing policy, a suboptimal sensing policy is obtained by using the Hungarian algorithm iteratively, which reduces the complexity of the channel assignment from an exponential to a polynomial order. We also propose a heuristic algorithm that reduces the complexity of the sensing policy further to a linear order. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a near-optimal performance with a significant reduction in computational time."
1118126,20178,369,On Precoder Design for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems,2011,"We investigate the problem of precoding optimization in an amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay system. Most reported works on this problem focus chiefly on the design of relay precoder without simultaneously optimizing the direct link. In this paper, we propose a method for joint source/relay precoder design, taking both direct and relay links into account. Our design is based on maximizing the mutual information (MI) under limited transmission power constraints at the source and relay, respectively. We first formulate a constrained optimization problem before relaxing the original cost function for tractability and derive a MI lower bound which asymptotically approaches the exact expression of MI in an iterative fashion. In contrast to previous strategies, we then prove that the optimal structure of the source and relay precoders jointly convert the MIMO relay channel into a bank of single-input-single-output (SISO) relay channels without having to assume a beamforming structure to simplify the derivation. Specifically, the linear precoding design problem degenerates into power loading among multiple SISO relay channels. Applying standard Lagrange technique results in a scalar convex optimization which can be readily solved by iterative water filling. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed scheme, either exploiting partial or full channel state information (CSI), significantly outperforms the existing methods."
959239,20178,369,Close-Coupled Chips Can Coordinate to Contain Collisions,2014,"Reducing collisions caused by the concurrent trans- missions of RFID chips (tags) is a crucial research topic in designing efficient air-interface protocols in passive-tag RFID systems. Different anti-collision protocols are proposed to improve the tag reading efficiency, by ordering the tags' participation over a period of time, by stochastic or deterministic manner. All existing anti-collision protocols follow a 'single line of thought'; wherein the onus for mitigating collisions is always on the reader, with no active role being played by the tags. We propose a fundamentally different strategy of enabling communications among the tags, especially to assist the reader in further resolving collisions. Overthrowing the conventional wisdom of limited RFID communication allowed only between the reader and tags, recent experimental studies have shown the possibility of Tag-to-Tag (T2T) communication, in industry popular UHF RFID systems. Two tags within the Near-Field (NF) of each other, can electro- magnetically couple with and therefore communicate, as long as they are receiving energy from the reader. A critical property of NF communication systems is their small reading range, about 30mm for a 900MHZ UHF RFID system. This provides a two spheres of communication, and enables concurrent T2T communications to happen within the long-range (around 6m) of a UHF RFID system. In this NF UHF passive tag RFID system, a tag can promiscuously listen to its NF neighboring tags' collided- transmissions, and give them a second chance for identification. In this paper, we will augment two different variants of frame- slotted ALOHA protocols to support promiscuous learning of NF tags, and study the change in reading efficiency in terms of delay and energy costs. Our detailed performance evaluation study will demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed augmented protocols, both in terms of delay and energy costs."
2679235,20178,369,How Vulnerable Is Vehicular Communication to Physical Layer Jamming Attacks,2015,"There has been numerous studies on the security of vehicular networks, focusing mainly at higher layers of the network stack. Vulnerabilities of vehicular communications at the physical layer have not been explored thoroughly. To that end, we study internal and external vehicular communication under a variety of attack strategies involving jamming at the physical layer. We consider a couple of attack strategies, differing in how the attacker jams the resource blocks within a targeted spectrum. In particular, we focus on flat and random jamming, which are oblivious to the existing assignments and smart jamming, which senses the assignments and allocates power in frequency accordingly. For intra- vehicular setting, we consider an attacker attached to various locations within the vehicle. We used software-defined radios in an actual vehicle to emulate potential realistic attack setups and tested the effectiveness of various attack strategies. We show that, the smart jamming attack can lead to significant degradations in communication performance, to the extent of a complete blockage even with a low jamming power, in most setups. For external communication setting, we consider a busy intersection and study uplink communication in a multicellular LTE network. Using a system-level LTE simulator we developed, we show that a flat jamming attack by a static attacker can degrade the global performance significantly, while the smart jamming attack by a stalking attacker can almost block the communication initiated from a targeted vehicle. In short, we demonstrate via real-world experiments and system-level simulations that, with an appropriate strategy, the impact of a physical layer jamming attacker can be highly detrimental to both internal and external vehicular communication, seriously threatening the security of vehicular networks."
525094,20178,8228,A centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame reconfigurations in synchronized HetNets,2015,"Traffic demands of mobile radio network have been tremendously increasing in the recent years due to the enormous success of smartphones and their continuous feature evolution requiring higher data rates. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of low-power small cells underlying the existing macro cells represent the preferred solution to increase the capacity of cellular systems by means of spatial spectrum reuse. Static uplink/downlink time-division duplexing (TDD) configurations of existing networks cannot satisfy the varying traffic patterns of large number of small cells, which vary among cells and over time. In this paper we propose and evaluate a centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame configuration to which operates on a cluster-based cellular network, maximize the network throughput and preserving fairness. Our algorithm is characterized by only O(n log n) time complexity (with n cells in the network), which allows for instantaneous network-wise reconfigurations minimizing overhead. The algorithm is proven to be optimal and time efficient. Extensive simulation results using realistic application traffic have shown the superiority the proposed solution against static TDD configurations of LTE systems. Throughput improvements up to 43% as well as reductions in queued traffic at cells up to 52% are obtained using separate utility functions designed for throughput maximization and fairness respectively."
1093595,20178,369,Suppression of Cyclic Prefix in Down-Link LTE like Systems to Increase Capacity,2013,"In this paper it is presented a proposal to increase the capacity of Down-Link (DL) transmissions in Long Term Evolution (LTE) like systems based on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The augment of the data rate is achieved with the total or partial suppression of the Cyclic Prefix (CP), which requires the use of a variable number of samples without conveying any information. The proposal is based on an iterative cancellation of the main impairments that the CP suppression supposes, the Inter Symbol and Inter Carrier Interferences. The interference mitigation procedure demands adequate channel estimations obtained in two different stages. Firstly, this new scheme requires the utilization of a preamble symbol appended to the beginning of the data transmission, which enables an initial Maximum Likelihood channel estimation. Secondly, time-variant channels will be estimated using a Least Squares estimator by the use of scattered pilots within the LTE frame structure. Through simulations it has been demonstrated that, despite the interferences arisen due to the CP suppression, our proposal attains adequate channel estimations which converge to theoretical bounds and the overall system obtains values of Bit Error Rate similar to the ideal situation of not suppressing the CP. It is also presented that considering the typical values of CP in the LTE standard the increment of the capacity employing this strategy can range between 7% and 25%."
2561021,20178,369,Local data control and admission control for QoS support in wireless ad hoc networks,2004,"Wireless ad hoc networks consist of nodes having a self-centrically broadcasting nature of communication. To provide quality of service (QoS) for ad hoc networks, many issues are involved, including routing, medium-access control (MAC), resource reservation, mobility management, etc. Carefully designed distributed medium-access techniques must be used for channel resources, so that mechanisms are needed to efficiently recover from inevitable frame collisions. For ad hoc wireless networks with a contention-based distributed MAC layer, QoS support and guarantee become extremely challenging. In this paper, we address this challenging issue. We first consider MAC and resource-reservation aspects for QoS support in one-hop ad hoc wireless networks. We propose two local data-control schemes and an admission-control scheme for ad hoc networks with the IEEE 802.11e MAC standard. In the proposed fully distributed local data control schemes, each node maps the measured traffic-load condition into backoff parameters locally and dynamically. In the proposed distributed admission-control scheme, based on measurements, each node makes decisions on the acceptances/rejections of flows by themselves, without the presence of access points. The proposed mechanisms are evaluated via extensive simulations. Studies show that, with the proposed schemes, QoS can be guaranteed under a clear channel condition while maintaining a good utilization. Discussions on applying the proposed schemes into multihop ad hoc networks are also included."
1968910,20178,369,Polarization Diversity with Genetic Parallel Printed Dipole Antennas for Bluetooth and WiMAX Applications,2006,"Multipath propagation effect degrades usually the wireless system performances. Antenna diversity in one of the several methods that have been studied to mitigate this phenomena. This technique can overcome the multipath fading improving the overall performance of communication system. In order to study the impact of the wireless channel and perform antenna diversity, two parameters must be evaluated: the mean effective gain, and the correlation coefficient between the antennas. Parallel printed dipole antennas have been successfully used in mobile base station development, showing either broadband or multiple-band properties besides its low cost. However, polarization diversity parameters have not been analysed since these antennas have not been yet considered in mobile devices and diversity applications. In this paper, a polarization diversity schema comprised of two dual-printed dipole antennas for bluetooth and WIMAX applications operating in 2.4-2.4835 GHz and 3.5 GHz frequency bands are presented. Genetic algorithm optimization (GA) is applied first, to a classical dual band printed dipole antenna schema, second to a pre-fractal tree parallel printed dipole to achieve a more compact radiator. Frequency performance of both antennas is introduced showing a VSWR< 1.5 for a input impedance of 50 Ohms. Later on, a diversity antenna based on the pre-fractal configuration is studied in terms of mean effective gain (MEG) and correlation coefficient for indoor and outdoor scenarios. Results shows that MEG is nearly the same in both environments with a low correlation between the elements which means that diversity gain can be achieved using this schema."
2889326,20178,369,Ring-Type Magnitude Modulation for OQPSK: Enabling NL-Amplification of Spectral Efficient Signals,2016,"Strongly nonlinear amplifiers have lower implementation complexity, together with much higher amplification efficiency than linear amplifiers. However, they are only recommendable when the signals at their input have very low envelope fluctuations, something that in general is incompatible with signals with high spectral efficiency (i.e. employing high-order constellations). It is proved, although, that spectral efficient M-ary constellations can be decomposed as a sum of several OQPSK signals that can be amplified separately, thus bringing a new life for this modulation scheme. Constant- envelope OQPSK-type signals can be obtained using its equivalent minimum shift keying (MSK) representation, but don't possess the required compact spectrum close to the minimum Nyquist frequency. This can only be achieved by employing narrowband Nyquist filters, which on the other hand causes the signal's envelope to fluctuate. Considering that, this paper proposes a ring-type magnitude modula- tion (RMM) method for narrowband offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) signals that considerably reduces its envelope fluctuations with- out spreading the transmitted signal's spectrum. Simulation results show that the reduction of the signal's dynamic range and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) allows the use of highly efficient, nonlinear saturated high power amplifiers (HPAs) without spreading the signal's spectrum and with minimum bit error rate (BER) performance degradation."
1659153,20178,369,Mobile speed estimation for TDMA-based hierarchical cellular systems,1999,"A new algorithm is presented for estimating mobile speed for handoff in hierarchical cellular systems. The proposed algorithm is based on normalized autocorrelation values of received signals to estimate mobile speed; it contains six steps. First, the instantaneous power of the received baseband signal is calculated to remove the frequency offset and data/speech information-bearing signals, while keeping the Doppler frequency information. Second, the calculated power signal is filtered using a low-pass linear phase finite impulse response filter to suppress interference and noise. Third, the filtered power signal is decimated to ease the computational burden, while the decimation factor is properly chosen to avoid frequency aliasing. Fourth, autocorrelation values of the decimated filtered power signals are calculated on shifting slot by slot to suppress the slot burst frequency interference. Fifth, the calculated autocorrelation values are normalized to suppress the power fluctuation of the received signals. Finally, the normalized autocorrelation values are compared with thresholds to estimate mobile speed. The simulation results indicate that the new algorithm works very well for both nondispersive channels and dispersive channels to distinguish fast and slow moving mobiles. The method has very low latency, with results being available typically within 1 s after communication is established, and it can report estimation result every second or less. The algorithm has been implemented by software code into Nortel's base-station radios and tested in Nortel's wireless communications labs."
2826735,20178,369,A Novel Graph-Based Topology Control Cooperative Algorithm for Maximizing Throughput of Disaster Recovery Networks,2016,"Deployment of portable access points (APs) in disaster affected areas has been heralded by many contemporary researchers as a key technique to formulate disaster recovery networks. However, existing research works do not effectively address one of its key problems, i.e., the low capacity of the backbone network (constructed by the APs) which is unable to satisfy the high user demands emanating from the users in the local network of each AP. We consider cooperative communications to be a promising candidate to alleviate this problem, and formulate the trade-off relationship between the gained throughput and the network complexity. Also, we propose a novel graph-based topology control algorithm to solve the problem by exploiting cooperative communications to increase the inter-AP throughput gain. We first model the network by using a logical graph, where any two nodes are connected by a logical link if they are within the transmission range of each other. After that, k best paths, in terms of throughput gain, via mobile terminals, are found to connect any pair of APs. The constructed topology based on the resulted paths is used for cooperative communications. An in-depth analysis of the effect of the value of k on the network complexity and throughput gain is presented. Also, by introducing cooperative throughput gain speed as the utility of our proposal, we prove that there is an optimal value of k that maximizes the utility. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the analytical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal."
1870449,20178,369,Outage Analysis of Correlated Source Transmission in Block Rayleigh Fading Channels,2012,"A goal of this paper is to theoretically derive the outage probability of the correlated source transmission in block Rayleigh fading channels. The correlation between the two information sources is assumed to be expressed by the bit flipping model, where the information bits transmitted from the second transmitter are the flipped version of the information bits transmitted from the first one, with a probability pe. The source sequences are independently channel-encoded, and then transmitted to the destination block-by-block via different time- or frequency-slots. The channels are assumed to be suffering from independent block Rayleigh fading. This paper shows that the outage probability of this system can be expressed by double integrals with respect to the probability density functions (pdf) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise power ratios (SNRs) of those channels, where the range of the integration is determined by the Slepian-Wolf theorem. The most significant finding made by this paper is that the asymptotic diversity order is one so far as pe is non-zero, and the 2nd order diversity can be achieved only if pe = 0. The major applications of this paper's results include outage evaluation of extract-and-forward (EF) relay systems allowing intra-link (source-relay link) errors, sensor networks, and wireless mesh networks. The latter half of this paper provides results of outage probability calculations for one-way EF relay scenario utilizing the concept of the technique presented in this work."

915923,20178,369,Dynamic Path Loss Exponent and Distance Estimation in a Vehicular Network Using Doppler Effect and Received Signal Strength,2010,"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can be used for navigation purposes in vehicular environments. However, the limited accuracy of GNSS makes it unsuitable for applications such as vehicle collision avoidance. Improving the positioning accuracy in vehicular networks, Cooperative Positioning (CP) algorithms have emerged. CP algorithms are based on data communication among vehicles and estimation of the distance between the nodes of the network. Among the variety of radio ranging techniques, Received Signal Strength (RSS) is very popular due to its simplicity and lower cost compared to other methods like Time of Arrival (TOA), and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). The main drawback of RSS- based ranging is its inaccuracy, which mostly originates from the uncertainty of the path loss exponent. Without knowing the environment path loss exponent, which is a time-varying parameter in the mobile networks, RSS is effectively useless for distance estimation. There are many approaches and techniques proposed in the literature for dynamic estimation of the path loss exponent within a certain environment. Most of these methods are not functional for mobile applications or their efficiency decreases dramatically with increasing mobility of the nodes. In this paper, we propose a method for dynamic estimation of the path loss exponent and distance based on the Doppler Effect and RSS. Since this method is fundamentally based on the Doppler Effect, it can be implemented within networks with mobile nodes. The higher the mobility of the nodes, the better performance of the proposed technique. This contribution is important because vehicles will be equipped with Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) in the near future."
301272,20178,8228,Wideband communication with high-dimensional arrays: New results and transceiver architectures,2015,"Wideband high-dimensional antenna arrays are expected to play a key role in future 5G wireless systems. Due to narrow beamwidths, phased array/beamforming methods are the natural choice for design and analysis of high-dimensional MIMO systems. However, conventional methods are based on the narrowband assumption which is violated as the bandwidth and array dimension increase. In this paper we revisit the use of high-dimensional arrays in line-of-sight single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We develop a channel model that reveals coupling between the spatial and temporal dimensions that is not captured by conventional separable models. We then apply beamspace MIMO (B-MIMO) theory - system representation with respect to orthogonal spatial beams - to analyze system performance. Our analysis reveals a key dispersion factor Δ ch  that captures the impact of array dimension and bandwidth on performance. We show that Δ ch  characterizes the magnitude of the coupled signal dispersion in spatial angle and time. This leads to new B-SIMO transceivers that use on the order of Δ ch  beams to deliver near-optimal performance with dramatically low complexity compared to the optimal receiver. We present results that demonstrate the significant losses incurred by phased array receivers, and the near-optimal performance of low-complexity B-SIMO transceivers. Extension of the new wideband LoS SIMO model to MISO, MIMO, and multipath scenarios is outlined."
2889900,20178,8228,Joint optimization of AN-aided beamforming and power splitting designs for MISO secrecy channel with SWIPT,2016,"In this paper, we study an energy harvesting scheme for a multiple-input-single-output secrecy channel under imperfect channel state information case with either deterministic and statistical channel uncertainties. The system consists of one multi-antenna transmitter, several multi-antenna energy receivers (ERs) and one single-antenna co-located receiver (CR) who adopts a power splitter to decode information and harvest power simultaneously. We consider the artificial noise (AN) embedded information-bearing signal to interfere potential eavesdroppers (i.e., ERs) and capture the harvested power. We perform joint optimization for the masked beamforming matrix, the AN covariance matrix and the power splitting ratio, such that the transmit power is minimized to satisfy the target secrecy rate of the CR, the total transmit power and the energy harvesting constraints for the CR and the ERs. By incorporating norm-bounded channel uncertainty model, we propose a robust joint design method to obtain the optimal solution. Also, a suboptimal algorithm for the outage constrained robust optimization problem is proposed by adopting the Bernstein-type inequality. Furthermore, the tightness of the relaxation for the proposed schemes are verified by showing that the optimal solution of the relaxed problem is rank-one. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the performance of our proposed schemes."
1775950,20178,369,Evaluation of a Network Based Mobility Management Protocol: PMIPv6,2009,"The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management protocol standard that was ratified recently by the Network-based Localized Mobility Management (NetLMM) working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). PMIPv6 is a protocol that uses the same concepts as used in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), but modified to operate in the network part only instead of involving the Mobile Node (MN) as well. PMPv6 is claimed to posses a number of advantages over the host based mobility management protocols in use today, above all MIPv6. The main advantage of using PMIPv6 is the freeing up of the mobile host in doing any mobility related activities and thereby saving its resources. The saving of resources may result in their usage for other purposes or even enable otherwise capabilities restricted devices to operate in the PMIPv6 domains. Other advantages include reduced signaling traffic volume and no tunneled packets in the access network. These aspects become very important since the access networks in mobile networks usually are air interfaces. Further, PMIPv6 is also becoming a very attractive mobility management protocol for mobile network operators as seen by its inclusion in current 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization as a possible alternative mobility management protocol for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technologies. In addition to qualitative analyses and comparisons, the work attempts to quantify these advantages to show the achieved benefits. The quantifications are done through measurements in a real test-bed which is installed with a PMIPv6 implementation developed as part of this work."
2666883,20178,369,Radio Resource and Interference Management in Uplink Multi-Cell MU-MIMO Systems with ZF Post-Processing,2015,"This paper presents our initial investigations of noise enhancement control when decoding uplink transmissions in multi-cell multiuser multiple- input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems with zero- forcing (ZF) post-processing. This problem has been partially addressed within simplified cellular system topologies and with single antenna terminals. However, applying existing solutions directly to a multi cell system is not viable due to the noise enhancement that would heavily affect the inter-cell interference (ICI). Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-layer resource allocation to improve the performance by utilizing a low complexity scheduling (user and antenna selection) and a power allocation method. The proposed scheduling algorithm extends our previous work to a multi cell system where the base and the mobile stations are equipped with multiple antennas. When allocating the power levels to different users in order to manage the multiple access interference (MAI) in MU-MIMO environment, we utilize Newton's method for resource optimization due to its efficiency in finding the combination of spatial streams and power levels to improve the average bit error rates (BERs) and their statistics for different users. This improvement in BERs is documented in terms of median and average BER performance in the system under study with and without centralized ICI cancelation."
2273428,20178,369,A Novel Multiplexing Method for High Data Rate Communication Systems,2006,"In order to improve exploitation in guided transport networks, many approaches have been investigated for the development of tools or systems able to provide needed information. Ours laboratories designed an original radar system that allows inter-vehicle communication. This system called CODIREP - communication detection and identification of broken-down trains - is based on the principle of a co-operative radar using a transponder inside targets. It is made of a transmitter/receiver couple, which equips respectively the front and the rear of two successive vehicles. It uses a numerical correlation receiver and has a broad band of about 100MHz which could be exploited to establish high data flow communications. A preliminary prototype was realized using a technical solution to multiplex communication data and localization code. The tests in free space and tunnel show that a range of 800 m in free space and 700 m in tunnel with a location precision of 1.5 m and a data rate of about 1.6 Mbps could be reached. This remains insufficient for some applications that require more resources. With the system, we intend to reach more than 5 Mbps. The aim of this work is to improve this system by proposing another original coding technique developed in order to increase the data flow rate. Simulations will be executed to evaluate the system's performances in terms of data flow, bit error rate (BER), computing time and complexity."
586645,20178,369,IP voice mail,2002,"The objective of these new algorithms is to specify means of using IP to leave and retrieve voice mail. The next generation wireless/wireline network is targeted to use IP as the transport for data and voice. However, the integration of PLMN/PSTN voice mail with IP network is not fully specified. Traditionally, the voice packet always has priority in the transmission in the IP network. The voice mail can and should be handled in a more efficient means so that its quality and timing will not suffer. However, the cost can be significantly reduced. This proposal uses the integrated signaling among wireline and wireless (PSTN/PLMN, TDMA, GSM, CDMA, AMPS) networks so that voice mail can be stored and later forward to the final destination with appropriate and most efficient bandwidth and vocoding resources. After the called party voicemail engine takes over, the signaling will be set up to notify the calling party network that the call is going to voice mail system. The calling party network can have local storage media to take over the recording from the caller and gives a estimated time of delivery on the current network traffic. The voice packets will, then, be sent through the IP network. It works like store and forward fax with some kind of efficiency and intelligence built in. IP multicast technology can also be integrated to support group or broadcast voice mail. As 3G is right around the corner, some features that could be supported by 3G technology are also discussed. For example, more efficient and intelligent interaction between user and handset regarding voice mail can be a reality now. The fundamental channel can be used to control the air-link resources. The JAVA enabled handset can support voice mail applications and be the middleware between user and system. This provides a means to better use the RF resources."
2051747,20178,369,Experimental Evaluation on Throughput Performance of Asymmetric Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced,2011,"This paper presents laboratory experimental results on the throughput performance of asymmetric carrier aggregation between the uplink and downlink using an LTE-Advanced testbed. The implemented base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) transceivers have transmission bandwidth capability of up to 100 MHz (5 component carriers (CCs)) and 40 MHz (2 CCs) in the downlink and uplink, respectively. The testbed also features CC-specific adaptive modulation and channel coding (AMC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) functionalities based on the actually transmitted control signaling. The experimental results show that, in the uplink, CC-based AMC using up to 64QAM high-order modulation is effective in increasing the user throughput in multipath fading channels and achieves a throughput greater than 100 Mbps using carrier aggregation with 2 CCs and 1-by-2 SIMO. The results also show that when the uplink control information (UCI) corresponding to 5 downlink CCs is multiplexed onto the uplink shared channel (PUSCH), the required block error rate (BLER) of the UCI below 10-2 is almost satisfied by appropriately setting the offset value, , for adjusting the channel coding rate of UCI although AMC with high-order modulation is applied to the UCI as well. Furthermore, we show that when carrier aggregation with 5 CCs and 2-by-2 MIMO multiplexing are applied in the downlink, high throughput greater than 500 Mbps (thus, half of the 1 Gbps that can be achieved using 4-by-4 MIMO multiplexing) is achieved at the average received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) of approximately 25 dB when CC-specific AMC considering UCI error is applied"
2367878,20178,369,A Scheme for Learning User Preferences: Enabling Personalisation in Cognitive Wireless Systems,2009,"The continuous evolution of wireless systems has resulted in a number of new and powerful wireless networking standards. The concept of Beyond the Third Generation Systems (B3G) emerged in an attempt to exploit the variety of the available access standards to the benefit of end-users, operators and manufacturers. In this context, a key topic in the research area of B3G/4G networks is related to mechanisms and strategies to efficiently realize the complementary use of the diverse Radio Access Technologies (RATs), through their convergence into one composite radio environment. One of the most important features of these evolving systems is the availability of multiple access technologies, which will allow users to enjoy wireless services at any time, at any place. Evidently in order to truly enhance the experience of all users, even technology agnostic ones, functionality is required, on both the network and the user- device side, for providing the always best connection in a transparent manner. The focus of this paper is more on the end- user side. The target is to realize management functionality that takes into account user requirements, environment characteristics, configuration policies and experience established so as to dynamically configure the user terminal in a seamless and transparent manner, through machine learning mechanisms. This can be achieved with the help of Bayesian Networks, a technique used for encoding and learning probabilistic relationships."
2106956,20178,369,Call Admission Control with Adaptive Active Link Protection for Wireless Systems,2006,"In wireless communication systems, a call admission control mechanism is usually deployed to determine whether a new communication node can be admitted into the network system. In wireless systems that implement power control, the maximum achievable signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for a new node depends on the link gains amongst all the co-channel interfering nodes involved and the white noise strength. Thus, one of the challenges in call admission control (CAC) in a wireless system with power control is the estimation of maximum achievable SINR when information about global link gains is not available. In this paper, by ignoring the white noise factor we present a predictor for the maximum achievable signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of a new node trying to get admission into a wireless system. Using the SIR predictor we then calculate an optimal active link protection margin, which together with the SINR or SIR threshold would constitute an enhanced threshold value for the new node to attain. By doing so current active links would be protected from performance degradation should the maximum achievable SIR value common to all the nodes be lower than the SIR threshold. For each nodal topology ranging from low density to high density values, the accuracy of the predictor is evaluated by means of simulation in terms of mean error and root mean square error. Together with finding the corresponding optimal active link protection margin, efficient CAC mechanism to ensure stability of the feasible system can be maintained over a wide range of operating SIR values"
419435,20178,369,Real-time Multi-resolution Data Transmission over Correlated Fading Channels using Hierarchical Constellations,2006,"We study in this paper an integrated packet scheduling and unequal error protection strategy for the transmission of packetized multi-resolution (layered) image/video data over time varying wireless channels. Different transmission priorities are given to different layers of video/image data not only by using hierarchical constellation (known also as nonuniform, asymmetric, multi-resolution constellation) at the physical layer but also by a buffer adaptive packet scheduling protocol at the medium access control (MAC) layer. Basically, according to the current buffer occupancy and channel state, the scheme dynamically selects packets from different resolution levels to transmit for the current transmission. The bits from the selected packets are assigned to different hierarchies of a hierarchical 4/16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In our proposed transmission framework, the transmit power level and the constellation priority parameter are also selected dynamically according to the quality of the wireless channel and scheduling state. In order to minimize the distortion in the received image/video with a given power budget, a joint optimization of the packet scheduling protocol, the transmit power level, and the constellation priority parameter is proposed. The power-distortion trade-offs curve is plotted for a given fading rate. We also compare the proposed scheme with a scheme employing uniform signal constellation. The comparison shows that in order to achieve a given quality of the received image/video, the scheme employing hierarchical QAM constellation always requires less power than the scheme employing uniform constellation."
470206,20178,8228,Coded full-duplex MIMO with iterative detection and decoding,2015,"In this paper, we investigate the performance of a coded full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output (FD-MIMO) bi-directional transceiver. To mitigate self-interference (SI), iterative detection and decoding (IDD) are proposed that utilize soft parallel interference cancellation (SPIC) with adaptive Minimum Mean-Squared-Error (MMSE) filtering. Furthermore, Space-Time Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (ST-BICM) based channel coding schemes are considered, i.e. convolutional or turbo code based, and the system performance is evaluated in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) over MIMO Rayleigh fading channels. The proposed near-optimal IDD scheme performs cancellation of SI by iteratively exchanging the soft information of the desired and SI signals between the detector, which comprises adaptive MMSE filtering with log-likelihood ratio (LLR) demapping, and the soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder implementing linear to logarithmic approximation of the maximum a posteriori algorithm. Performance results are presented to demonstrate the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of the proposed coded FD-MIMO as a function of the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, a comparison of the proposed IDD system with relevant state-of-the-art approaches is given which shows a significant improvement in performance as a result of the introduced iterative processing that reduces SI considerably."
2257750,20178,369,Performance of Relay-Aided DS-CDMA Experiencing Propagation Pathloss and Nakagami Fading,2008,"In relay-aided cellular wireless communications mobile terminals (MTs) near the base-station (BS) are usually preferred to being selected as relays for the sake of achieving the relay diversity while simultaneously obtaining a high power-efficiency. However, this strategy may result in a so-called 'bottleneck' problem, when each source MT employs different relays, since the available relays near the BS are limited. In this contribution we propose and study a relay diversity scheme for uplink direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems. In the proposed scheme all the uplink source MTs share a set of relays chosen in the vicinity area of the BS, and the number of relays is independent of the number of source MTs. Therefore, the proposed relay scheme can significantly mitigate the above-mentioned 'bottleneck' problem. In this contribution the performance of the uplink DS-CDMA using our proposed relay diversity scheme is investigated, when either the maximal ratio combining aided single-user combining (MRC-SUC) or maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio aided multiuser combining (MSINR-MUC) is employed. We assume that the channels experience both propagation pathloss and fast Nakagami-m fading. Our study and simulation results show that the diversity gain may be overwhelmed by the multiuser interference (MUI), when the MRC-SUC is employed. However, when the MUI is efficiently suppressed with the aid of the MSINR-MUC, then the full diversity gain can be achieved and the bit error rate (BER) performance of the DS-CDMA improves, when increasing the number of relays."
1828256,20178,369,Measurement and characterization of the temporal behavior of fixed wireless links,2005,"We analyze the methodology and present the interpretation of results obtained in the measurement of the temporal Ricean K-factor and the time-autocovariance function of the received power for fixed narrowband wireless links in urban residential environments. Our main observation is that the time-autocovariance function (and thus both the temporal K-factor and the coherence time) fundamentally depends on a combination of the characterization of the transmit-receive path and whether the street-level moving objects are in the field of view of the antennas. In most practical cases the latter refers only to the customer premises antenna, as the base station is typically placed at a much greater distance from moving scatterers. No significant basis was found for the popular conjecture that the K-factor is mainly influenced by the excess path loss. However, a strong correlation between coherence times and temporal K-factor was observed over a wide range of link conditions. We also found that the time-autocovariance function can be quite accurately modeled by the weighted sum of two exponentially decaying functions: one with a time constant on the order of 1 s and the other typically slower by one order of magnitude. The results will be helpful in establishing design criteria for radio systems such as multiple input-multiple output that need to estimate the channel response and its persistence in time and for media access control (MAC) layer transmission protocols whose efficiency is affected by the depth and duration of channel outages."
2339639,20178,369,A Hybrid Simulation Framework for Modeling and Analysis of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks,2011,"The development and evaluation of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) and their applications is usually based on coupled simulation environments combining microscopic traffic models and packet level network simulations. However, it is difficult or rather impossible to build simulation scenarios where all the protocols, possible situations and various traffic conditions are properly modeled. This can be attributed to the common lack of information and fine grained control of traffic patterns, missing protocol implementations, and the performance problems of such interlinked simulators. Therefore, simplifications are usually applied on all levels of development and modeling. The novelty of this paper can be found in the effort to propose a framework integrating novel statistical information propagation and higher level communication protocol models into an overall hybrid simulator. The proposed simulation framework can be applied for protocol design and system analysis when it is difficult to build complex interlinked simulation scenarios. In our simulation framework, different models from different levels of operation are integrated. More exactly, this includes a macroscopic traffic model, an information propagation VANET model and discrete event-driven protocol models implemented in the MatLab/Simulink environment. The simulator is validated through various input parameters and scenarios. The results show good performance and interesting aspects of the hybrid simulator; thus, our framework provides a promising tool for development and evaluation of VANET protocols and applications."
2886427,20178,8228,Dynamic strict fractional frequency reuse for software-defined 5G networks,2016,"The surge of mobile data traffic has spurred academia and industries to begin developing 5G networks. 5G is meant to overcome limitations of 4G cellular technology relying on the dominant trend of mobile network densification with the deployment of small cell base stations. To accelerate this process, low complexity and inexpensive remote radio heads (RRHs) are deployed massively and connected to a centralized pool of resources. In this work, we study the problem of inter-cell interference (ICI) which arises in frequency reuse one multi-tier 5G networks. We entrust the management of RRHs to a software-defined network controller and we take advantage of network functions virtualization. Our contributions consist of proposing Dynamic Strict Fractional Frequency Reuse (DSFFR), a method to relieve ICI which dynamically divides the small cell area in a different number of sectors. Furthermore, we formulate a joint scheduling problem composed of two schedulers which operate at different time granularity to transmit downlink packets. Modeling the coverage area with the tool of stochastic geometry and solving with simulations the joint scheduling problem, we are able to show that DSFFR outperforms the static scheme. Performances are addressed in terms of spectral efficiency and packet blocking probability."
2182782,20178,369,Variable Threshold M-QAM With Feedback Delay Over Nakagami-m Fading Channels,2009,"In this paper, we propose an adaptive M -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M -QAM) with variable threshold, which adapts the threshold of rate-region boundaries to the variation of feedback delay between the transmitter and the receiver, over independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d) Nakagami-m fading (NMF) channel. The proposed scheme exploits the estimation of instantaneous bit error rate (BER) which is based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion in (1). Based on the proposed scheme, we derive the threshold adaptation algorithm to minimize the effect of the feedback delay on the spectral efficiency and the average BER. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is more reliable to the feedback delay than conventional adaptive M -QAM with fixed thresholds. Index Terms—adaptive modulation, threshold adaptation, BER estimation, MQAM mismatch between the estimated channel gain and the actual channel gain, while achieving spectral efficiency gain from the rate adaptation. Using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) based instantaneous BER estimation that was proposed in (1), we derive closed-form expressions for the threshold adaptation that can reduce the effect of channel gain mismatch caused by the feedback delay. We also analyze the effect of feedback delay on the performance of the proposed scheme with respect to the average spectral efficiency and the average BER. In our study of the proposed scheme, we evaluate its performance results, and compare these results to those of the conventional fixed threshold M -QAM (FT-M -QAM) scheme in (9). This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the system and channel model under consideration are described. Then we propose the threshold adaptation scheme and derive its analytical expression in Section 3. In Section 4, we analyze the impact of time delay on the average spectral efficiency and the average BER of adaptive M -QAM, and numerical results from the performance analysis are presented. Finally in Section 5, a brief conclusion is provided."
830198,20178,10228,Effect of receive spatial diversity on the degrees of freedom region in multi-cell random beamforming,2013,"The random beamforming (RBF) scheme, together with multi-user diversity based user scheduling, is able to achieve interference-free downlink transmission with only partial channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. The impact of receive spatial diversity on RBF, however, is not fully characterized even under a single-cell setup. In this paper, we study a multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast system with RBF applied at each base station and either the minimum-meansquare-error (MMSE), matched filter (MF), or antenna selection (AS) based spatial receiver applied at each mobile terminal. We investigate the effect of different spatial diversity receivers on the achievable sum-rate of the multi-cell RBF system subject to both the intra- and inter-cell interferences. We focus on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and for a tractable analysis assume that the number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the per-cell SNR. Under this setup, we characterize the degrees of freedom (DoF) region for the multi-cell RBF system, which constitutes all the achievable sum-rate DoF tuples of all the cells. Our results reveal significant sum-rate DoF gains with the MMSE-based spatial receiver as compared to the case without spatial diversity or with suboptimal spatial receivers (MF or AS). This observation is in sharp contrast to the existing result that spatial diversity only yields marginal sum-rate gains based on the conventional asymptotic analysis in the regime of large number of users but with fixed SNR per cell."
2896453,20178,10228,Energy detection based spectrum sensing over enriched multipath fading channels,2016,"Energy detection has been for long constituting the most popular sensing method in RADAR and cognitive radio systems. The present paper investigates the sensing behaviour of an energy detector over Hoyt fading channels, which have been extensively shown to provide rather accurate characterization of enriched multipath fading conditions. To this end, a simple series representation and an exact closed-form expression are firstly derived for the corresponding average probability of detection for the conventional single-channel communication scenario. These expressions are subsequently employed in deriving novel analytic results for the case of both collaborative detection and square-law selection diversity reception. The derived expressions have a relatively tractable algebraic representation which renders them convenient to handle both analytically and numerically. As a result, they can be utilized in quantifying the effect of fading in energy detection based spectrum sensing and in the determination of the trade-offs between sensing performance and energy efficiency in cognitive radio communications. Based on this, it is shown that the performance of the energy detector depends highly on the severity of fading as even slight variations of the fading conditions affect the value of the average probability of detection. It is also clearly shown that the detection performance improves substantially as the number of branches or collaborating users increase. This improvement is substantial in both moderate and severe fading conditions and can practically provide full compensation for the latter cases."
1312807,20178,369,Distributed Interference Management in Femtocell Networks,2011,"This paper considers a two-tier cellular network wherein femtocell users, who communicate with their home-owner-deployed base stations, share the same frequency band with macrocell users by code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology. Since macrocell users have strictly higher priority in accessing the available radio spectrum, their quality-of-service (QoS) performance, expressed in terms of the minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), should be maintained at all times. Femtocell users, on the other hand, are allowed to exploit residual network capacity for their own communications. In this work, we develop a joint power- and admission-control algorithm for interference management in such two-tier networks. Specifically, throughput-power tradeoff optimization is achieved for femtocell users while all macrocell users being supported with guaranteed QoS requirements whenever feasible. Importantly, the proposed algorithm makes power and admission control decisions in an autonomous and distributive manner with minimal coordination signaling, a desirable feature in two-tier networks where only limited exchange of signaling information can be afforded on backhaul links. Under certain practical conditions, the developed scheme is shown to converge to a stable solution. An effective technique is also proposed to improve the efficiency of such equilibrium in lightly-loaded networks. The performance of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical results."
1037477,20178,369,Optimization of Scheduling and Routing in Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks Using Cubic Games,2012,"In this paper we present nonlinear 3 player game model for joint routing, network coding, and scheduling problem. To define such a game model, first routing and network coding are modeled by using a new approach based on compressed topology matrix that takes into account the inherent multicast gain of the network. Topology matrix includes the set of all possible paths, including network coded paths, from sources to their corresponding sinks. These paths are identified and compressed, and then by switching between some of them with appropriate usage rates (frequencies), achievable throughput is optimized. The scheduling is optimized by a new approach called network graph soft coloring. Soft graph coloring is designed by switching between different components of a wireless network graph, which we refer to as graph fractals, with appropriate usage rates. Therefore each link can be painted with more than one different colors selected with appropriate probabilities. In the proposed game which is a nonlinear cubic game, the strategy sets of the players are links, path, and network components. The outputs of this game model are mixed strategy vectors of the second and the third players at equilibrium. Strategy vector of the second player specifies optimum multi-path routing and network coding solution while mixed strategy vector of the third players indicates optimum switching rate among different network components or membership probabilities for optimal soft scheduling approach. Optimum throughput is the value of the proposed nonlinear cubic game at equilibrium. The proposed nonlinear cubic game is solved by extending fictitious playing method. Numerical and simulation results prove the superior performance of the proposed techniques compared to other conventional schemes."
2113516,20178,369,Robust Extraction of Temporal Correlation from Noisy Data,2009,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role in several application fields. They are composed by a dense deployment of small and low-power devices (called sensors) that cooperate together in order to perform some special tasks. These networks are often characterized by the spatial and temporal correlation of the sensor observations. Several works are investigating these correlations in order to design efficient communication protocols able to improve the performance of the networks. On these basis, it is necessary to: 1) extract the correlation function and 2) ensure that it is always valid, even if data are impaired by noise. The proposed approach is inspired to (1), where the authors have developed a new technique to robustly extract the statistical characteristics of process variations from experimental measurements in order to analyze and optimize the design of integrated systems. Our aim here is to investigate the correlation issue in the WSNs context where the data sensed by the nodes are usually correlated in the space and temporal domains. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a robust method to extract temporal correlation function parameters from noisy data gathered by a WSN and use some simulation results to validate our technique. Moreover, we analyze the reliability of our method with respect to the amount of collected measurement data and show that, on the basis of the obtained results, the temporal extraction process is efficient and robust in real cases."
2354519,20178,369,Performance Analysis of Wideband Sum-of-Cisoids-Based Channel Simulators with Respect to the Bit Error Probability of DPSK OFDM Systems,2009,"In this paper, we analyze the performance of a wideband sum-of-cisoids (SOC) channel simulator w.r.t. the bit error probability (BEP) of differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Analytical BEP expressions are derived for coherent and non- coherent DPSK OFDM simulation systems in the presence of a wideband SOC channel simulator. We also study the degradations of the BEP introduced by an imperfect channel simulator. Using the deviation of the BEP as an appropriate measure, we evaluate the performance of three parameter computation methods, known as the method of exact Doppler spread (MEDS), the randomized MEDS (R-MEDS), and the Monte Carlo method (MCM). For coherent DPSK OFDM systems, it turns out that these three methods are equivalent. For noncoherent DPSK OFDM systems, it is theoretically shown that both the MEDS and the R-MEDS outperform the MCM. The correctness of all theoretical results are validated by simulations. density functions (PDFs) of the absolute value of the time- variant transfer function and the temporal-frequency correla- tion function (CF) of both channel models. Next, we derive the BEP expressions for the OFDM systems using coherent and noncoherent DPSK schemes. For the coherent DPSK OFDM system, we demonstrate that the BEP of the simulation system approaches to the reference BEP if the number of cisoids in the SOC channel simulator tends to infinity. Based on the analytical BEP results, we discuss the deviation between the reference BEP and the BEP of the simulation system. Then, we compare the performance of three parameter computation methods: the MEDS, the R-MEDS, and the MCM. We assume isotropic scattering conditions here. However, it should be mentioned that the obtained BEP expressions are general and also applicable to non-isotropic scattering conditions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we first give a brief review of the frequency-selective ref- erence channel model and the corresponding SOC channel simulator. Then, we study the statistical properties of both channel models. Section III provides an analysis of the BEP performance of coherent DPSK OFDM systems. In Section IV, we concentrate on the noncoherent DPSK OFDM system performance analysis. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section VI."
2439522,20178,8228,Performance evaluation framework for vertical handoff algorithms in heterogeneous networks,2005,"The next generation (4G) wireless network is envisioned as a convergence of different wireless access technologies providing the user with the best anywhere anytime connection and improving the system resource utilization. The integration of wireless local area network (WLAN) hotspots and the third generation (3G) cellular network has recently received much attention. While the 3G-network can provide global coverage with a low data-rate service, the WLAN can provide a high data-rate service within the hotspots. Although increasing the underlay network utilization is expected to increase the user available bandwidth, it may violate the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of active real-time applications. Hence, achieving seamless handoff between different wireless technologies, known as vertical handoff (VHO), is a major challenge for 4G-system implementation. Several factors, such as application QoS requirements and handoff delay, should be considered to realize an application transparent handoff. We present a novel framework to evaluate the impact of VHO algorithm design on system resource utilization and user perceived QoS. We used this framework to compare the performance of two different VHO algorithms. The results show a very good match between simulation and analytical results. In addition, it clarifies the tradeoff between achieving high resource utilization and satisfying user QoS expectations."
2682875,20178,369,Spatio-Temporal Multi-Stage OpenFlow Switch Model for Software Defined Cellular Networks,2015,"The tremendous increase on mobile data traffic has stressed conventional cellular networks recently. In order to handle this rapid increase, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is proposed as one of the novel approach that makes it easier to orchestrate physical devices in Data Plane with its centralized control fashion. On one hand, SDN provides scalability and flexibility on network management with dummy OpenFlow(OF) switches and its nature of centralized authority; on the other hand, these properties cause spatial and temporal complexity in the Data Plane. Spatial complexity, described as Memory Usage in an OF switch, should be minimized by removing redundancy on OF switch flow table pipeline. Temporal complexity, defined as Flow Forwarding Delay, should also be reduced by lowering number of comparison in OF switch pipeline to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) of a flow. Therefore, in this paper, a novel Multi-Stage OF (MsOF) Switch model is proposed and examined considering Queuing Theory in the light of spatial complexity and temporal complexity parameters. According to performance evaluation results, specially in urban areas, MsOF has much less spatial and temporal complexity considering conventional OF switch model as the number of input ports in an OF switch (N) increases. MsOF gains much memory space by deploying more tables with less memories, total of (n · k). Furthermore, with such a Multi-Stage deployment of flow tables, MsOF provides approximately 7 times less flow forwarding delay, compared with a conventional OF Switch for a network load more than %60."
539654,20178,8228,Experimental evaluation of reverse direction transmissions in WLAN using the WARP platform,2015,"This paper describes an experimental implementation of a variation of the Reverse Direction (RD) Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol (RDP) defined in the IEEE 802.11n using the Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP). The proposed approach, named Bidirectional MAC (BidMAC), allows the receiver of a valid data sequence to perform an RD transmission to the transmitter without contending for the channel. Whereas in RDP the RD transmission must be initiated by the transmitter, in BidMAC it can be dynamically initiated by the receiver according to its traffic requirements. Previous results based on mathematical analyses and computer-based simulations have shown that BidMAC can better balance downlink and uplink transmission opportunities in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) where the Access Point (AP) handles bidirectional data flows for some of its wireless stations (STAs). This paper aims at going one step further and demonstrating that such superior performance can be attained in real environments. Towards this end, an implementation of BidMAC has been carried out in a reference design of WARP compatible with the IEEE 802.11a/g and tested in a proof-of-concept network formed by an AP and two STAs. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of BidMAC when compared to the legacy Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) of the IEEE 802.11 versus the traffic load, packet length, and data rate, yielding gains of up to 60%.*"
1685069,20178,369,Multi-Objective Portfolio Optimization for Spectrum Selection in Cognitive Radio Systems,2013,"The use of cognitive radio technology will allow for adaptive access to licensed and unlicensed portions of the spectrum. This, in turn, will improve end-user satisfaction and will partially alleviate the bandwidth scarcity problem. However, different parts of the spectrum not only have different network (e.g. radio and load) conditions, but also different licensing and/or billing agreements. Therefore, in order for the operators to obtain the major profit and the most efficient use of radio resources, their allocation must now target both technical and economic performance metrics. This problem can be conveniently formulated as a multi-objective portfolio optimization problem. This paper aims to adapt the concepts behind multi-objective portfolio optimization, commonly used in the areas of economics and finance theory, to the particular case of spectrum selection in cognitive radio. The idea is to investigate the advantages and potential interactions between technical and economic approaches. This paper proposes a framework for such coexistence and provides simulation results considering the Pareto optimal trade-off region obtained when using a multi-objective function based on the average return and risk per-Hz of allocated spectrum. The results show that network and economic metrics can be conveniently maximized inside the Pareto optimal trade-off region given an appropriate balance between average return and the allowed risk of primary and secondary transmissions, where risk is directly associated with the interference created from secondary to primary users."
494545,20178,369,Mitigating Pilot Contamination by Pilot Reuse and Power Control Schemes for Massive MIMO Systems,2015,"The performance of massive multiple input multiple output systems may be limited by inter-cell pilot contamination (PC) unless appropriate PC mitigation or avoidance schemes are employed. In this paper we develop techniques based on existing long term evolution (LTE) measurements - open loop power control (OLPC) and pilot sequence reuse schemes, that avoid PC within a group of cells. We compare the performance of simple least-squares channel estimator with the higher-complexity minimum mean square error estimator, and evaluate the performance of the recently proposed coordinated pilot allocation (CPA) technique (which is appropriate in cooperative systems). The performance measures of interest include the normalized mean square error of channel estimation, the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise and spectral efficiency when employing maximum ratio transmission or zero forcing precoding at the base station. We find that for terminals moving at vehicular speeds, PC can be effectively mitigated in an operation and maintenance node using both the OLPC and the pilot reuse schemes. Additionally, greedy CPA provides performance gains only for a fraction of terminals, at the cost of degradation for the rest of the terminals and higher complexity. These results indicate that in practice, PC may be effectively mitigated without the need for second-order channel statistics or inter-cell cooperation."
2316832,20178,369,Constrained least squares SDMA detector for single carrier transmission with cyclic prefix,2001,"The two major obstacles towards high-capacity indoor wireless networks are distortion due to the indoor channel and the limited bandwidth which necessitates a high spectral efficiency. The combination of single carrier with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) modulation and spatial division multiple access (SDMA) tackles both obstacles and paves the way for low cost, high-capacity wireless indoor networks (see Vandenameele, P. et al., ICASSP, p.3714-17, 2000). The channel distortion due to multipath propagation is elegantly mitigated with SC-CP while the bandwidth efficiency is increased with the use of SDMA. However, to keep the WLAN cost low, simple SDMA processors with good performance are necessary. Hence, we propose a new low-complexity multiuser SDMA detector, which is designed for constant modulus signals. This linear constrained least squares (CLS) receiver, which explicitly exploits the constant modulus nature of the modulation, is compared in terms of performance and complexity with the zero forcing (ZF) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver. Simulations show that the CLS detector significantly outperforms the ZF detector and comes very close to the performance of the MMSE detector. Furthermore, the estimation complexity for the CLS detector is substantially lower than for the MMSE detector, which additionally requires estimation of the noise power."
2291224,20178,369,Optimized Signal Acquisition for Low-Complexity and Low-Power IR-UWB Transceivers,2007,"Impulse-based ultra-wideband systems are appealing for low-power short-range communications as they can benefit from duty-cycled low-complexity analog architectures. Low-power receivers correlate in the analog domain and sample only at the pulse repetition frequency. However, achieving acquisition with such a receiver requires an efficient search strategy, as digital post-processing (equalization) of the signal is not possible. Moreover, as we target a network of ultra-low-power sensors which can only send a few pulses and do not implement receiver functionality in order to sustain ARQ protocols, the receiving base station has extra constraints on synchronization performance and maximal preamble length. This paper describes and optimizes a strategy compliant with that scenario, including pulse position and spreading code phase acquisition, end-of-preamble detection, and derivation of the corresponding detection thresholds. Based on a 300-bit preamble, it works within 1.5 dB of ideal synchronization on AWGN. EOP detection is analyzed, showing that a PN sequence of length 7 is sufficient, and also proposing optimal receive filters for EOP sequences defined in IEEE 802.15.4a. Finally, we show that on fading channels, the error floor coming from missed acquisitions can be removed by simply changing the detection threshold."
2270019,20178,369,Performance Evaluation of Spatial Mode Adaptation and HARQ in Cellular Downlink Systems,2007,"System level simulations in a realistic multi-cell model are needed to evaluate the performance of the adaptive radio link and radio resource management (RRM) algorithms for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we consider spatial mode adaptation, modulation adaptation, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and scheduling in a cellular network. In order to simulate a considered multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) physical layer, a novel link frame error rate (FER) prediction method is presented. Link-to-system level method is based on the mutual information metric which takes multiple antenna receiver and multiple antenna channel coding into account. The proposed metric is shown to provide an accurate FER approximation for diverse range of MIMO-OFDM channels also with inter-cell interference and HARQ. System level results illustrate that the MIMO-OFDM system with adaptive space-frequency turbo coded modulation (SFTuCM) provides flexibility and high spectral efficiency for interference limited system. The MIMO-OFDM system with interference averaging frequency hopping channel allocation achieves performance close to the channel condition aware dynamic channel allocation (DCA) with time division multiple access (TDMA)."
1902607,20178,369,Comparison of Spectrum Sharing Techniques for IMT-A Systems in Local Area Networks,2009,"The explosive growth of mobile communications on one hand and the overly crowded and expensive spectrum on the other hand have fueled hot debates on spectrum sharing techniques, anticipating fundamental changes in spectrum regu- lation. A key point of the discussions has been the need for empirical tests and validation of even the simplest spectrum sharing proposals already available. In this paper, inspired by IEEE 802.11 WLANs, the authors employ carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) in an LTE-Advanced framework and compare the achieved performance with that of an ordinary LTE-Advanced system employing static frequent reuse schemes. The analysis is performed by means of system level simulations in Local Area networks where the e-NodeBs (eNB) may be randomly placed without any prior considerations to minimize inter-cell interference. Average and cell-edge user throughput results show that the contention based approach, despite its beautiful simplicity, wastes resources due to random back-off timers and hidden nodes. In nearly all cases, well known frequency reuse alternatives are more interesting options. Index Terms—Spectrum-sharing, LTE-Advanced, Local Area, Contention, Frequency reuse, WLAN."
651506,20178,369,An efficient algorithm for optimum joint downlink beamforming and power control,2002,"We address the problem of joint downlink beamforming and power control in a frequency flat multi-antenna broadcast channel. In this context, a common optimization strategy is to maximize the system throughput under a certain power constraint. This, however, does not guarantee a fair sharing of throughput among the users, which is required in case that the receivers cannot cooperate. Thus, we propose a different approach, which always assumes optimally balanced data rates. If the problem is feasible, i.e., desired target rates can be reached, spare degrees of freedom can be used in order to minimize the total transmission power. This strategy can even be applied if only spatial covariance channel information is available. The authors have developed a theoretical framework based upon uplink/downlink duality, feasibility considerations, and bounds on the maximal eigenvalue of the resulting coupling matrix. An overview of the results is given and they are discussed in the context of existing literature. Finally, a theoretical benchmark is provided for the case of perfect channel knowledge. Then, beamforming can be combined with Costa (1983) pre-coding, as proposed by Caire and Shamai (see 36th Asilomar Conf. on Signals, Systems and Computers Asilomar Pacific Grove, CA, Nov. 2001). This leads to a closed-form solution of the problem."
1908032,20178,369,A Close to Capacity Double Iterative Based Precoder Design for MU-MIMO Broadcast Channel with Multi-Stream Support,2011,"Many algoritms have been proposed for precoders design in a multiuser MIMO system (MU-MIMO). Nevertheless, the proposed solutions showed to have better results for some SNRs (signal to noise ratio) regions and degrade in some other parts. This paper proposes a new double iterative procedure for sum-rate maximization. The proposed algorithm is based on jointly optimizing the precoders and decoders using two different decoding schemes. The solution here is supporting multi-streams per user. The algorithm is based on a WMMSE (weighted minimum mean square error) precoder combined with two iterative receivers namely the MF (matched filter) and MMSE (minimum mean square error) decoders. The resulting precoding matrices from the first algorithm (WMMSE/MF) are used as an initialization for the second one (WMMSE/MMSE). The choice of these decoders and their combination has been done according to their properties. Another crucial point in this proposal is the decision on the switching point between these two algorithms. A dynamic algorithm introducing very low extra complexity is proposed here. To validate our proposed solution we compare it with an existing MMSE and WMMSE based iterative optimization algorithms. The obtained results demonstrate significant gains without introducing supplementary complexity. Comparison with DPC (dirty paper coding) performances shows how close our proposed solution is to the BC (broadcast channel) channel capacity."
2890477,20178,8228,Analysis of fog effects on terrestrial Free Space optical communication links,2016,"In this paper, we consider and examine fog measurement data, coming from several locations in Europe and USA, and attempt to derive a unified model for fog attenuation in free space optics (FSO) communication links. We evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed model to that of many well-known alternative models. We found that our proposed model, achieves an average RMSE that outperforms them by more than 9 dB. Furthermore, we have studied the performance of the FSO system using different performance metrics such as signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, bit error rate (BER), and channel capacity. Our results show that FSO is a short range technology. Therefore, FSO is expected to find its place in future networks that will have small cell size, i.e., <1 km diameter. Moreover, our investigation shows that under dense fog, it is difficult to maintain a communications link because of the high signal attenuation, which requires switching the communications to RF backup. Our results show that increasing the transmitted power will improve the system performance under light fog. However, under heavy fog, the effect is minor. To enhance the system performance under low visibility range, multi-hop link is used which can enhance the power budget by using short segments links. Using 22 dBm transmitted power, we obtained BER=10−3 over 1 km link length with 600 m visibility range which corresponds to light fog. However, under lower visibility range equals 40 m that corresponds to dense fog, we obtained the same BER but over 200 m link length."
243960,20178,369,Non-Cooperative Inter-Cell Interference Coordination Technique for Increasing Throughput Fairness in LTE Networks,2015,"One major concern for operators of Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks is mitigating inter-cell interference problems. Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) techniques are proposed to reduce performance degradation and to maximize system capacity. It is a joint resource allocation and power allocation problem that aims at controlling the trade-off between resource efficiency and user fairness. Traditional interference mitigation techniques are Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR). FFR statically divides the available spectrum into reuse-1 and reuse-3 portions in order to protect cell-edge users, while SFR reduces downlink transmission power allocated for cell-center resources to protect vulnerable users in the neighboring cells. However, these static techniques are not adapted to non-uniform user distribution scenarios, and they do not provide guarantees on throughput fairness between user equipments. In this paper, we introduce a non-cooperative dynamic ICIC technique that dynamically adjusts resource block allocation according to user demands in each zone. We investigate the impact of this technique on throughput distribution and user fairness under non-uniform user distributions, using an LTE downlink system level simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed technique improves system capacity, and increases throughput fairness in comparison with reuse-1 model, FFR and SFR. It does not require any cooperation between base stations of the LTE network."
2513732,20178,369,Successive MAP Detection with Soft Interference Cancellation for Iterative Receivers in Hierarchical M-ary QAM Systems,2009,"This paper proposes a successive MAP(maximum a posteriori probability) detection scheme to reduce the receiver complexity of hierarchical M-ary QAM system. In order to detect a specific symbol in a hierarchical M-ary QAM symbol, modulation symbols generated from other data streams are treated as an Gaussian noise or eliminated as an soft interference according to their priorities. Then, the MAP detector calculates the log-likelihood ratio of the a posteriori probability of each bit successively with an adjusted noise variance in order to take the elimination and Gaussian assumption effect into account. By separating the detection process into the successive steps, the detection complexity is reduced to increase linearly with the number of bits per hierarchical M-ary QAM symbol. Simulation results show that the proposed detection scheme provides a slightly performance degradation compared to the optimal MAP detection scheme. able performance with a reduced complexity as compared to the iterative MAP detection and decoding techniques. In this paper, applying the soft interference cancellation technique to hierarchical M-ary QAM system, a successive MAP detection is proposed to reduce the receiver complexity. In order to detect a symbol generated from specific priority bits, the signal components generated from higher priority bits are treated as an interference signal and the soft interference cancellation technique is applied while the signals generated from lower priority bits are assumed to be an Gaussian noise. Then, the MAP based detection algorithm is employed to generate the extrinsic information, in which the a posteriori probabilities of data bits are calculated after adjusting the noise variance in order to take account the Gaussian assumption and the interference eliminating effects. By separating the detection process into the successive steps, the detection complexity can be reduced to increase linearly with the number of bits per modulation symbol. Simulation results show that, as compared to the performance of the optimal MAP detection scheme, the performance degradation due to the successive detection is within 0.5 dB for the high priority bit stream and almost same for the low priority bit stream."
291520,20178,369,Statistical Analysis of the Channel Capacity Outage Intervals in Massive MIMO Systems with OSTBC over Rayleigh Fading Channels,2015,"This paper studies approximate solutions for the statistical properties of the outage intervals of the instantaneous capacity in massive multiple- input multiple- output (MIMO) sys- tems with orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) over Rayleigh fading channels. We take advantage from the fact that the probability density function (PDF) of the channel power gain can be approximated by a left-truncated Gaussian distribution if the number of transmit and receive antennas is large. Assuming a symmetrical Doppler power spectral density (PSD), a closed- form expression is presented for the Rice probability function of the outage durations. This function, in general, approximates the PDF of the outage intervals only over its initial part. By applying the asymptotic behavior of level crossings of Gaussian processes, an alternative expression, valid only for low capacity thresholds, is obtained, which, in turn, is applied to determine an approximate solution for the kth-order moments of the outage intervals. Also presented is the PDF of the so- called instantaneous capacity loss with respect to the average capacity. Simulation results have been shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical approximations, thereby con&#64257;rming their validity. Although, the focus of the study is on massive MIMO systems, it has been observed that the approximations are accurate even for a moderate number of antennas such as the case of 4&#x000D7;4 MIMO-OSTBC systems."
2520416,20178,8228,Multiuser Extensions for Closed Loop Transmit Diversity in HSDPA,2009,"Closed loop transmit diversity has already been adopted by 3GPP for MIMO HSDPA in the form of TxAA and its dual stream counterpart, D-TxAA. While both these transmission techniques provide performance gains for single user (SU) scenarios, they both introduce multi-user interference in the downlink in multi-user(MU) scenarios. In this paper, we study the extension of these transmission techniques to the multi-user case which entail minimal changes to the existing standard. To this end, we consider the classical MMSE chip equalizer receivers that feed back beamforming weights so as to maximize the receive SINR at each user equipment (UE). Given that the base station (BS) has to use these weights to transmit data to the UEs, we compare practical and realistic strategies that BS can employ in order to maximize downlink capacity. We derive the SINR expression for MMSE chip equalizer receivers for the general case of MU-TxAA which is used at the receivers to select optimum feedback weights. We investigate different multiuser schemes for HSDPA in the downlink (DL), compare their performance and suggest optimal strategies for single and dual stream transmission for both single and multi-antenna receivers and corroborate our arguments with simulation results. We show that for the case of single antenna receivers, scheduling users with same beamforming weights maximizes downlink capacity in TxAA. For the D-TxAA with multiple antennas at receivers (MIMO) we show that SDMA outperforms spatial multiplexing in terms of maximizing DL capacity."
2204657,20178,369,Minimizing Power Using Large Bandwidth PPM Transmission and DPCM Source Coding,2009,"To prolong the lifetime of nodes in wireless sensor networks, both transmission cost and processing power should be minimized. For this purpose, we propose a new direct source channel mapping method which utilizes large bandwidth. The system combines a closed-loop Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) source coder followed by pulse position modulation (PPM) transmission. To accommodate closed-loop prediction over a noisy channel an additional feedback channel is used. Two or more sequential samples are predicted at a time and combined before transmission, thus reducing transmission cost further. Simulations performed on both an auto regressive AR(1) source and a test image over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel show that our proposed system can achieve significant energy saving for both noiseless and noisy feedback channels without delay. We therefore propose a new framework for direct joint source channel mapping utilizing large bandwidth. Our system combines a closed-loop DPCM encoder followed by pulse position modulation (PPM) transmission. The source data redundancy is removed by DPCM. The closed loop prediction in DPCM is achieved by using a feedback channel from the receiver back to the transmitter. The major advantage of the system is its simple implementation on sensor nodes, while still achieves significant energy efficiency, robustness to error and performs without delay. The system provides an effective way for bandwidth expansion with high expansion factors which is complicated to achieve with the previous approaches (2-3). We investigate our system in both noiseless and noisy feedback channels. PPM transmission can be used in noisy feedback link which can achieve nearly same performance for both noiseless and noisy feedback channel."
2621806,20178,369,Performance of Limited Feedback Strategies with Massive MIMO,2015,"Massive MIMO is considered an important technique for improving cellular system capacity through the use of high gain adaptive beamforming and high-order spatial multiplexing. For downlink Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD) cellular systems, limited feedback strategies can provide the information needed for computing the transmit weights for Single User or Multi-User MIMO. However, for MU-MIMO transmission accurate channel knowledge is critical for obtaining the best performance. In this paper, we explore the performance characteristics of several limited feedback schemes with 2D cross-polarized arrays for evolutions beyond the current 3GPP LTE Rel-12 standard. We characterize the performance of product codebook-based feedback along with several scalar quantization schemes, all schemes having different levels of feedback overhead requirements. This is compared against a high performing Rel-12 compatible vertical sectorization scheme at the low end and also against the performance with ideal knowledge of the downlink covariance matrix at the high-end. We consider a 64 element transmit array with 16 transceiver units as a case study on the effects of various restrictions on the feedback scheme, such as a DFT beam structure, block diagonal structure, and Kronecker azimuth/elevation structure."
1627421,20178,10228,QoE-Aware Scheduling for Video-Streaming in High Speed Downlink Packet Access,2010,"With widespread use of multimedia communication, quality of experience (QoE) progressively becomes an important factor in networking today. Besides, multimedia applications can be supported under various technologies, including wired and wireless networks. Among them, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is one of the most popular technology thanks to its support on mobility. Improved with a new access method (High Speed Downlink Packet Access or HSDPA), it can provide higher bandwidth and enable wider range of services including multimedia applications. In UMTS, different categories of traffic are specified along with their characteristics. Best effort traffic has been specified with less priority because it has fewer constraints. On the other hand, real-time multimedia traffic such as streaming video or VoIP are more sensitive to network condition changes, hence special treatment (e.g. QoS scheduler) is needed in order to achieve user satisfaction. According to the literature, most of scheduling mechanisms mainly take into account signal quality and fairness and do not consider user perception. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, QoE-aware scheduler that takes quality of experience into account when making scheduling decisions. Compared to other existing schedulers, QoE-aware approach has reached a profitable performance in terms of user satisfaction, throughput, and fairness."
1745168,20178,369,60 GHz-Ultrawideband Real-Time Multi-Antenna Channel Sounding for Multi Giga-Bit/s Access,2010,"60 GHz technology has been proposed recently for multi-Giga-bit/s access within different application scenarios, e.g. in crowded multi-user public transportation (PT) environments. Hence, channel sounders that are used to investigate multipath propagation and multi-user access techniques including spatial diversity and beam-forming in time-variant shadowing environments require ultra-wideband (UWB) operation, multiple antennas, and real-time. This paper presents probably the first channel sounder architecture fulfilling these requirements. Moreover, an experimental study is described which is performed for planning purposes and deployment of 60 GHz WLAN/WPAN networks in PT scenarios. Coverage analysis based on different PHY channelization schemes, including multiple access point configurations and antennas is addressed for the Airbus 340 cabin. Additionally, distributions of time dispersion, coherent bandwidth, and Rice K-factor in the in-cabin coverage area are presented. Specifically, a brief analysis under dynamic channel conditions due to human activities is introduced. The suitability of the 60 GHz-UWB channels sounder for PT scenarios is demonstrated. Besides, some channel results for finding the most suitable system parameters for 60 GHz access deployment of in-flight-entertainment (IFE) systems are given."
1284758,20178,369,Toward Real-Time Vehicle Detection Using Stereo Vision and an Evolutionary Algorithm,2012,"A new approach for vehicle detection and distance estimation based on stereo vision and evolutionary algorithm (SEA) is described in this paper. First, we reuse our recent work on FPGA implementation of census-based correlations for stereo matching. Next, the SEA uses the gray scale left image and disparity information obtained from the FPGA system to detect the preceding vehicle and estimate its distance. This paper introduces an effective ﬁtness function that allows our proposed method to have an improved performance and higher accuracy when compared with the existing evolutionary algorithm (EA) based methods. A new crossover type, tourna-ment crossover, is introduced to reduce the convergence time of our proposed. This paper also introduces a new approach for estimating the ﬁtness function parameters. This estimation differs from the traditional EA because these parameters were generally created via experiments. Moreover, the processing time and accuracy of SEA can be improved by converting the global search to the local search with V disparity map. The robust experiments have proved that SEA successfully detects vehicles in front and sustains noise from different objects appearing along the road. The detection range is 10m-140m, the detection rate is 95 % and the average processing-time is approximately 31 ms/frame on CPU. These results prove that SEA is suitable for a real-time system."
2209414,20178,369,Fully-Polarimetric MIMO to Improve Throughput and Reliability across Propagation Conditions,2009,"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) function- ality has been shown to dramatically increase the capacity of wireless communication systems when the environment provides rich multipath scattering. In a predominantly Line-of-Sight (LOS) environment, the loss of diversity reduces the potential gain considerably. This can be remedied in part by the use of dual-polarized antennas, which increases the rank of the wireless channel and introduces diversity, while minimizing the antenna's form factor. However the performance of a dual- polarized antenna is still degraded by antenna rotations that are typical of mobile terminal operation. This paper presents a solution which uses a triad antenna at the transmitter and a triad at the receiver, to provide a 8-10 dB gain over the baseline dual-polarized system. A triad is composed of three orthogonal dipoles oriented in perpendicular directions. A triad antenna can generate an arbitrary oscillating dipole moment at the transmitter and consequently an arbitrary polarized electric field at the receiver, subject only to the constraints imposed by the physics of the Electromagnetic (EM) fi eld. We show that, in LOS environments, the capacity of the channel is invariant under arbitrary rotations of the transmit and/or receive antennas about their centres. Simulation results show that the performance is stable as the propagation environment varies from rich scattering to pure LOS. A full rate 3 × 3 Space-Time Block Code (STBC) is proposed for the triad system that is designed for low complexity decoding."
785088,20178,369,Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization of Encoding Sequence for a Reduced Complexity OFDM Time Synchronization Technique,2013,"A new Genetic Algorithm (GA) based sequence optimization is here proposed. The studied sequence, which we refer to as Encoding Sequence (ES), is used in a recently proposed OFDM preamble-based synchronization technique. The optimal ES is generated offline by differentially correlating the preamble samples to each other respecting a shift. To determine the frame start at the receiver, the ES is correlated to a version of the received signal generated using differential correlation respecting the same shift as in the ES generation. This treatment, carried online, is of high complexity due to the differential correlation operations. To reduce the computational load at the receiver, the idea here is to replace the differential correlation operations, carried during the synchronization process, by simple sign changes. To this aim, we need to derive the best sub-optimal ES, in terms of providing near optimal performance, from a finite QPSK alphabet (±1±j). Even if this search procedure is carried off-line, considering an exhaustive search over the whole ES candidates within QPSK alphabet results in a prohibitive complexity. As an alternative, we here suggest to use a GA-based approach. Performance comparison of the proposed ES, generated through GA-based search, to the optimal ES, generated from the preamble, and a previously proposed QPSK ES optimized through an iterative algorithm has been conducted. It is demonstrated that compared to the iteratively generated ES, the herein proposed one improves the detection accuracy. The GA-based provides slightly lower detection accuracy with respect to the optimal ES, yet with important reduction in the receiver complexity."
2230517,20178,369,Analysis into Timing Advance Issue in CoMP Systems,2009,"Coordinated Multi-Point transmission / reception (CoMP) has been adopted in LTE-Advanced to improve system performance, especially user equipment (UE) at the cell edge. The conventional timing advance (TA) design is not suitable since a UE can be served by multiple geographically distributed access points (AP). TA issue's impact is investigated in great detail. Simulation results validates that the conventional design limits performance improvement. Two ways can be taken to solve the issue: 1) to adopt extended cyclic prefix (CP); 2) to adjust TA based on the nearest AP. Both ways increase the number of UEs that can use CoMP, but the extended CP incurs a large overhead that lowers throughput. The latter scheme can bring 15% throughput improvement over a non-CoMP system, and is recommended to be adopted in the CoMP system. This paper analyzes the TA issue in CoMP systems and proposes several solutions. The CoMP technique is firstly introduced, with the TA issue demonstrated by an example. The distribution of signal's arriving times and detection performance with different arriving times validates the impact of TA issue. Two ways can be adopted to solve the issue: 1) to adopt extended CP; 2) to adjust TA based on the nearest AP. The merits and drawbacks of these solutions are analyzed. Both ways can bring higher coordination degree than the conventional design (more CoMP UEs). However, extended CP incurs large overhead and hence low throughput. The latter solution is recommended for CoMP with better performance. The paper is organized as follows: Section II gives a general overview of CoMP transmission; Section III describes TA issue in CoMP; Section IV provides analysis to TA issue's impact to CoMP; Section V provides two ways to solve TA issue, including detailed analysis and evaluation; and the conclusions are drawn in Section VI."
388718,20178,369,Joint Minimum Variance Unbiased and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Clock Offset and Skew in One-Way Packet Transmission,2015,"In distributed systems like large wireless sensor networks, dense indoor small cell networks, maintaining each node's logical clock synchronized to a common reference is challenging. Increasing data rates and required cooperation among nodes for high spectral efficiency, further exacerbate the required clock synchronization accuracy. Here, we propose a one way timing information distribution mechanism simplifying existing two way information exchange for clock synchronization. We view the problem at the synchronizing node as a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) continuously running process. A node with stable clock (master) transmits regular packets embedded with transmit time stamps. All synchronizing nodes within the master's communication range can listen and apply receive time stamp. Efficient Passive Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (PMVUE) or Passive Maximum Likelihood Estimator (PMLE) are applied to jointly estimate clock offset and skew to correct the local clock. Random component of the link delay is assumed to be Gaussian distributed. Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) guarantees that PMVUE and PMLE are efficient. We also propose a less accurate PMLE method, Independent PMLE (IPMLE) to remove dependency on random delay distribution parameter and show through simulations the high accuracy of our algorithms."
2020602,20178,369,A Simplified Iterative Water-Filling Algorithm for Per-User Power Allocation in Multiuser MMSE-Precoded MIMO Systems,2008,"In this paper, we deal with a per-user power allocation problem in multiuser multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) systems based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) preceding. The MMSE- precoding technique provides a reasonable performance due to minimization of a composite interference-plus-noise power through allowing inter-user interference as well as the higher capacity with multiuser spatial multiplexing. The technique also has a reasonable computational complexity with linear transmit processing. The problem of optimizing per-user power allocation under inter-stream interference is not convex. Hence, we invoke some iterative approaches. In this paper, we propose a simplified iterative water-filling (SIWF) algorithm for per-user optimum power allocation in multiuser MMSE-precoded MIMO systems, in order to maximize the downlink sum capacity. This technique can reduce greatly the computational complexity for the iterative water-filling process through accelerating the iteration process, as compared with the existing modified iterative water-filling (MIWF) algorithm (Wei Yu, 2007), without any performance loss. In the proposed algorithm, both the taxation and interference terms are updated at every iteration of the inner loop of iterative water-filling. In addition, per-user power levels at every iteration for the inner loop are normalized so that the total transmit power constraint could be satisfied, prior to the next iteration. From computer simulations and complexity analyses, we show that the proposed algorithm has much lower complexity but the same capacity, as compared with the original MIWF algorithm."
1820511,20178,369,Cost Efficient Deployment of Heterogeneous Wireless Access Networks,2007,"As data applications become more popular in mobile networks, usage patterns will be different from mobile telephony. Demand for higher bit rates is found in certain areas (hot spots), whereas the requirement for wide area coverage remains. Previous work has shown that using classical cellular hot-spot techniques (e.g., micro-cells) with a single radio access technology imply high-cost solutions. Instead, combining several, carefully chosen, access technologies in an efficient manner, leads to reduced infrastructure related costs while retaining a sufficient quality of service. In this paper, we estimate the user data rates achievable by complementing an urban macro cellular high speed packet access (HSPA) system with different hot spot solutions. When deployed at comparable cost levels, dense macro, micro, and pico HSPA base stations yield a similar performance in downlink. Thanks to more spectrum bandwidth, IEEE 802.11a WLAN supports higher data rates in downlink both on average and for the lower percentiles of users. For the uplink, which in principal is noise limited already with a few hot spots deployed, indoor (pico and WLAN) base stations outperform outdoor systems, which are subject to severe propagation losses for indoor users."
3175333,20178,369,Client-Based Control Channel Analysis for Connectivity Estimation in LTE Networks,2016,"Advanced Cyber-Physical Systems aim for the balancing of restricted local resources of deeply embedded systems with cloud-based resources depending on the availability of network connectivity: in case of excellent connectivity, the off-loading of large amounts of data can be more efficient than the local processing on a resource- constraint platform, while this latter solution is preferred in case of limited connectivity. This paper proposes a Client-Based Control Channel Analysis for Connectivity Estimation (C3ACE), a new passive probing mechanism to enable the client- side to estimate the connection quality of 4G networks in range. The results show that by observing and analyzing the control traffic in real-time, the number of active user equipment in a cell can be determined with surprising accuracy (with errors well below 10^-6). The specific challenge addressed in this paper lies in a dedicated filtering and validation of the DCI (Downlink Control Information). In a subsequent step the data rates to be expected can be estimated in order to enable decision about the choice of network and the timing of the data offloading to the cloud. The proposed methods have been implemented and validated leveraging the SDR OpenAirInterface, a real- life LTE network and a distributed load generator producing a scalable network traffic by a number of LTE User Equipment."
1955173,20178,369,Random Access Capacity Evaluation with Synchronized MTC Users over Wireless Networks,2011,"Increased attention has been drawn to machine type communication (MTC) lately, which represents important extension for user functionality in today's technologies, as well as an important potential for marketing expansion. GERAN studies over MTC has mainly focused on applications requiring low throughput and wide coverage such as smart meter, which could cause some impacts over normal data users if operating in a synchronous manner. This paper proposes a new methodology for studying the impact on signaling channels when mixture of synchronous and asynchronous traffic is present in the network. This is based on statistical analysis, considering signaling accessing attempts as driven by a Poisson process. In this approach successive random access attempts by the mobile stations are considered as well as the response on the network side. First implementation is held for GSM/GPRS network, although generalization of the method for other technologies is possible. The simulated results show potential problems to be solved when a large number of synchronized users is present. Additionally, an analysis on the effects of the different levels of synchronization and the addition of extra signaling channels is included. Results also point out possible development paths that could be taken when designing new features to make networks more robust to synchronized traffic."
2812394,20178,369,Enhanced Channel Feedback Schemes for Downlink NOMA Combined with Closed-Loop SU-MIMO,2016,"As a promising downlink multiple access scheme for further cellular enhancements toward 5G, non- orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) improves both cell average and cell-edge user throughput compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Our previous work showed that NOMA can improve system performance compared with OMA even when combined with multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO). However, for NOMA with MIMO, the inter-user interference becomes a dominant part of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). Thus, the conventional channel information feedback scheme, which is based on channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback for OMA, is insufficient for base station (BS) to perform accurate modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection for NOMA users. In this paper, we propose two enhanced channel feedback schemes to improve performance of channel feedback for NOMA systems. One is based on outer loop link adaptation (OLLA), which controls the feedback update by a predefined time window to improve the accuracy. No extra feedback signaling is needed in the scheme. The other one improves the original channel feedback by an extra quantized increment feedback from user equipment (UE) to BS, which benefits BS with more information for MCS selection. The performance improvements of NOMA with closed- loop (CL) single-user (SU) MIMO are investigated by system-level simulations with practical assumptions. Simulation results show that the performance gains of NOMA for both cell average and cell-edge user throughputs improve with the proposed channel feedback schemes."
309341,20178,369,"An Empirical Study of Urban Macro Propagation at 10, 18 and 28 GHz",2016,"This paper investigates the propagation characteristics of the urban macro cells at centimeter-wave (cmWave) frequencies, in particular at 10, 18 and 28 GHz. The measurements are performed at several transmitter (Tx) locations and heights, in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, and with distances up to 1,400 m. The distancedependent mean path loss and shadow fading standard deviation (std) are extracted for all cases based on a single-slope path loss model, and offered here for quick determination of link budget and system capacity. The results show the potential usage of the cmWave band for mobile cellular services in the years to come: the NLOS path loss slopes at 10 and 18 GHz are not much different from the 2 GHz reference, and the corresponding offsets are in the order of 20-23 dB for 25 m Tx height. This gap is expected to be overcome by the usage of high-gain miniaturized steerable antennas, which is feasible due to the reduced antenna aperture size at the cmWave band. Similar to the 2 GHz band, the NLOS shadow fading std for cmWave is within 6 dB. The effect of Tx height is clearly shown in the NLOS scenario: at 10 GHz, for example, 7.5 dB reduction in attenuation could be achieved by raising the Tx antenna from 15 m (below average roof-top) to 25 m (above roof-top), or 23.4 dB if the Tx height is elevated to 54 m."
1267819,20178,369,Linear Pre-Coding Performance in Measured Very-Large MIMO Channels,2011,"Wireless communication using very-large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas is a new research field, where base stations are equipped with a very large number of antennas as compared to previously considered systems. In theory, as the number of antennas increases, propagation properties that were random before start to become deterministic. Theoretical investigations with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian (Rayleigh fading) channels and unlimited number of antennas have been done, but in practice we need to know what benefits we can get from very large, but limited, number of antenna elements in realistic propagation environments. In this study we evaluate properties of measured residential-area channels, where the base station is equipped with 128 antenna ports. An important property to consider is the orthogonality between channels to different users, since this property tells us how advanced multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) pre-coding schemes we need in the downlink. We show that orthogonality improves with increasing number of antennas, but for two single-antenna users there is very little improvement beyond 20 antennas. We also evaluate sum-rate performance for two linear pre-coding schemes, zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE), as a function of the number of base station antennas. Already at 20 base station antennas these linear pre-coding schemes reach 98% of the optimal dirty-paper coding (DPC) capacity for the measured channels."
2351490,20178,369,A Markov Model for HSDPA TNL Flow Control and Congestion Control Performance Analysis,2011,"High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is an extension of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) technology of 3GPP Rel-99, with the objective of increasing the data rate and also reducing the latency in the downlink. The focus of this study is to develop an analytical model for HSDPA flow control (FC) and congestion control (CC) performance analysis. HSDPA flow control adapts transport network data flow to the time varying radio channel capacity of a MAC-d flow [4, 21, 22]. Often the Transport Network Layer (TNL) is congested when there is no sufficient transport capacity to fulfil the radio capacity demand for all connections giving rise to the degradation of the overall HSDPA performance [5, 17, 23, 22]. There are several simulation based investigations carried out so far for the performance analysis of flow control and congestion control algorithms [5, 17, 19, 22, 23]. Further an analytical model which is based on the Embedded Markov Chain with Multiple Departures (EMC- MD) was developed to analyse the effect of CC for the HSDPA performance [18]. However it does not include the flow control functionality which works in cascade with the congestion control algorithm. In order to overcome this issue a joint Markov model is developed which is the focus of this paper. The paper provides detailed modelling aspects of above two algorithms and also the comparison of results with simulation results. There is close agreement with analytical and simulation results."
1586015,20178,369,Field Experiment of Multi-BS Cooperative Transmission Control over X2 Interface for LTE/LTE-Advanced,2013,"The multiple base station cooperation approach has been attracting much attention recently. In 3GPP, this approach is referred to as CoMP. The promising techniques in CoMP are joint transmission and dynamic cell selection. They improve cell-edge UE throughput through the cooperation of eNBs, however, the signal-processing burden or the technical difficulties to realize the accurate synchronous transmission is high. As an alternative for improving cell-edge throughput, cooperative transmission control has been proposed, in which signal transmission is conducted from only the serving cell while transmission from its neighbor cell is stopped. This technique can mitigate the signal-processing burden or the technical difficulties of CoMP while achieving sufficient throughput improvement. However, the previous studies were based on centralized cooperation with the use of an optical fiber system such as RRH or RoF. Therefore, cooperation is possible only within the eNBs connected to the same central signal processing unit. To avoid this limitation, we propose cooperative transmission control based on a distributed cooperation approach that uses an inter- eNB interface such as X2. It allows cooperative transmission control to be realized at any cell border. We also propose the control algorithm to start and end the cooperation properly, which is a key part to improve cell-edge throughput effectively on the distributed approach. We also develop a prototype system to demonstrate the feasibility and the performance of the proposal. Through laboratory and field experiments, we show that the proposal works well with real equipment and that cell-edge UE throughput performance can be improved drastically."
2598460,20178,9589,"Boon and bane of 60 GHz networks: practical insights into beamforming, interference, and frame level operation",2015,"The performance of current consumer-grade devices for 60 GHz wireless networks is limited. While such networks promise both high data rates and uncomplicated spatial reuse, we find that commercially available devices based on the WiHD and WiGig standards may suffer from their cost-effective design. Very similar mechanisms are used in upcoming devices based on the IEEE 802.11ad standard. Hence, understanding them well is crucial to improve the efficiency and performance of next generation millimeter wave networks. In this paper, we present the first in-depth beamforming, interference, and frame level protocol analysis of off-the-shelf millimeter wave systems with phased antenna arrays. We focus on (a) the interference due to the lack of directionality of consumer-grade antennas, and (b) the degree of data aggregation of current devices. Regarding (a), our beam pattern measurements show strong side lobes that challenge the common conception of high spatial reuse in 60 GHz networks. We also show that reflections in realistic settings worsen this effect. Further, we measure weak directionality when beamforming towards the boundary of the transmission area of an antenna array. Regarding (b), we observe that devices only aggregate data if connections require high bandwidth, thus increasing medium usage time otherwise."
2251484,20178,369,Performance of forward link broadband OFCDM packet wireless access using MMSE combining scheme based on SIR estimation,2002,"This paper proposes a pilot channel assisted minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining scheme in orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing (OFCDM) based on actual signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) estimation and investigates the throughput performance in a broadband channel with a near 100-MHz bandwidth. In the proposed MMSE combining scheme, the combining weight of each sub-carrier component is accurately estimated from the channel gain, noise power, and transmission power ratio of all the code-multiplexed channels to the desired one, by exploiting the time-multiplexed common pilot channel in addition. to the coded data channel. Simulation results elucidate that the required average received signal energy per bit-to-noise spectrum density ratio (E/sub b//N/sub 0/) for the average packet error rate (PER)=10/sup -2/ is improved by 0.6 and 1.2 dB by using the proposed MMSE combining Instead-of the conventional equal gain combining (EGC) in a 24-path Rayleigh fading channel (exponential decay path model, maximum delay time is approximately 1 /spl mu/sec) in an isolated cell environment, when the number of multiplexed codes = 8 and 32, respectively, with the spreading factor of 32. Furthermore, when the average received E/sub b//N/sub 0/=10 dB, the achievable throughput, i.e., the number of simultaneously multiplexed codes for the average PER=10/sup -2/ in the proposed MMSE combining, is increased by approximately 1.3 fold that of the conventional EGC."
2081368,20178,369,Performance of a high-resolution scheme for joint estimation of delay and bidirection dispersion in the radio channel,2002,"This contribution presents results from an application of the SAGE (space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization) algorithm published in Fleury et al. (2002) to measurement data collected in a selected propagation environment. The scheme jointly estimates the delay, the direction (i.e. azimuth and coelevation) of departure, the direction of incidence, as well as the Doppler frequency of waves propagating from the transmitter to the receiver. An improved initialization and search procedure is proposed which enhances the probability of identifying weak paths and therefore allows for a more comprehensive and detailed characterization of the propagation mechanisms. In order to relate the estimated waves to the propagation environment, a simple method based on ray tracing attempts to reconstruct the propagation paths based on the estimated wave parameters while assuming oneand two-bounce scattering. Significant objects can be identified in the environment that coincide with the interaction points of the calculated paths. The same conclusions can be drawn from similar analyses of other environments. The presented results demonstrate the high potential of high-resolution estimation techniques performing true joint estimation of delay, direction of departure, and direction of incidence for detailed investigations of dispersion in the radio channel jointly in delay and in direction at both transmitter and receiver sites. These studies are of paramount importance for an accurate characterization of MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems operating in these channels."
1017436,20178,369,Streaming Video Capacity Comparisons of Multi-Antenna LTE Systems,2010,"The 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release-8 specifications are designed to deliver higher peak data rates, higher throughput and lower air-interface latency compared to 2G and 3G systems. This higher performance will make it possible to support more demanding applications beyond web-browsing and voice, requiring higher data rates and stricter QoS constraints. Video services are becoming increasingly popular over the Internet indicating that the demand for such high data-rate video applications over cellular wireless will continue to grow. However, in order to make these services commercially viable in a LTE system it is necessary for the air-interface to deliver high quality services to a significant number of users simultaneously. In this paper we investigate the video capacity of a LTE air-interface using realistic video traffic models. An LTE air-interface can support multiple-antenna transmit arrays and several multiple antenna transmission modes to increase system capacity. We investigate the benefits of using 4 transmit antennas compared to 2 transmit antennas on the video capacity of an LTE system. The results from our investigation indicate that the capacity benefits with 4 transmit antennas are much higher with video services than those observed with other traffic models such as the full-buffer traffic model. The results also show that a 10MHz TDD LTE system can service upto 48 users per sector with 256Kbps video streams in the downlink indicating that such services can be commercially viable."
424576,20178,369,Robust Synchronization Approach for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Space-Time Diversity,2015,"In this paper, we propose a robust timing and frequency synchronization scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems. Exploiting a preamble of two identical parts and proceeding in two stages, the proposed technique achieves synchronization under non- coherent detection. To take advantage from transmit diversity, we use differential Alamouti space time block coding which provides full- spatial diversity without requiring any channel knowledge in neither the transmitter nor the receiver. Two different replicas of the preamble are generated and sent simultaneously from dual- antenna transmitter. At the receiver side, a coarse synchronization is first carried onto the received signal to roughly localize the preamble respecting the famous Cox and Schmidl algorithm. Second, differential Alamouti decoding must be achieved to recover the transmitted signal. Then, a fine synchronization metric is calculated based on cross-correlating the recovered signal with the local known preamble to detect the exact preamble start. The fine metric is calculated over a short interval around the coarse time estimate which relaxes the computational complexity of this stage. As a byproduct, the fractional part of the frequency offset is estimated using the same timing metric. Computer simulations carried to evaluate the proposed technique show its robustness in the Rayleigh fading channel under non-coherent reception."
838905,20178,369,Interworking Scheme Using Optimized SIP Mobility for MultiHomed Mobile Nodes in Wireless Heterogeneous Networks,2010,"Nowadays, mobile users wish to use their multi-interface mobile devices to access the Internet through network points of attachment (PoA) based on heterogeneous wireless technologies. They also wish to seamlessly change the PoAs during their ongoing sessions to improve service quality and/or reduce monetary cost. If appropriately handled, multihomed mobile nodes offer a potential solution to this issue. In this paper, we present an improvement of SIP mobility (pre-call plus mid-call mobility) to support seamless mobility of multihomed mobile nodes in heterogeneous wireless networks. Pre-call mobility is extended to associate user identifier (i.e. SIP URI) and interface identifiers (i.e. IP addresses). The multiple addresses of a mobile device are weighted by the user to create a priority list in the SIP server so as to guarantee resilient reachability of mobile nodes and to avoid unnecessary signaling through wireless links, thus saving radio resources. Then, three variations of mid-call mobility, called hard, hybrid and soft procedures, are also proposed. Their main aim is to minimize, or even avoid, packet losses during interface switching at the mobile node. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a wireless heterogeneous testbed composed of 802.11 WLAN plus 3.5 cellular network, which are fully controlled and configurable. The testbed has been used to study the performance and the robustness of the three proposed mid-call mobility procedures."
557159,20178,8228,Angular characteristics of a unified 3-D scattering model for emerging cellular networks,2015,"A stochastic geometry-based unified three-dimensional (3-D) channel model for emerging land mobile radio cellular systems is proposed. Uniformly distributed scattering objects are assumed bounded within an ellipsoidal shaped scattering region (SR) hollowed with an elliptical-cylindric scattering free region. To ensure the degree of expected accuracy of the proposed model, the outer bounding ellipsoid and inner bounding elliptical-cylinder are designed to be tuneable as required, unlike its counterparts in the existing literature, independently along all the axes and rotatable in horizontal plane around their origin centered at the mobile station (MS). Closed-form analytical expressions for joint and marginal probability density functions (PDFs) of angle-of-arrival (AoA) in azimuth and elevation planes observed at the base station (BS) are derived. The obtained analytical results for angular statistics of the channel are presented along with a thorough analysis. Moreover, the impact of various physical model parameters on angular statistics of the channel is presented. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed generalized model and analytical method, a comparison with experimental datasets is also presented. The obtained analytical results are seen to fit a vast range of empirical datasets obtained for different outdoor propagation environments available in the literature."
2827866,20178,8228,Bayesian QAM demodulation and activity detection for multiuser communication systems,2016,"We consider overloaded (non-orthogonal) multiple access multiuser wireless communication systems with many transmitting devices and one central aggregation node, a typical scenario in e.g. machine-to-machine communications. The task of the central node is to detect the set of active devices and to separate and detect their data streams, whose number at any time instance is small compared to the total number of devices in the system. The payload bits are mapped to a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbol alphabet, transmitted by the active devices and received synchronously at the central node. The data detection can be cast as a compressed sensing (CS) problem due to the sparsity granted by the sporadic transmission of the typically low-complexity nodes. Separation of the real and imaginary parts of the measurement matrix, the unknown QAM symbols, and the received signal yields a group-sparsity problem. We utilize an efficient iterative Bayesian CS recovery scheme which, instead of separately solving for the real and imaginary parts, uses the Turbo principle to exchange and update parameters between the two solvers and thus comes to consensus regarding the sparsity structure. By tailoring this algorithm to QAM detection, joint activity detection, demodulation and data detection with high reliability is possible, even for very large-scale systems."
1864858,20178,369,The performance of robust adaptive modulation over wireless channels with non reciprocal interference,2002,"Adapting a modem's modulation scheme can significantly enhance the resulting performance over a wireless communications link. Non-adaptive modems are generally designed conservatively for worst-case channel conditions. Adaptive modems are able to exploit the higher channel capacity when good conditions are encountered. A number of different metrics can be used to drive the adaptation process (i.e. automatic repeat request (ARQ) or segment error rate (SER)). Not surprisingly, certain metrics are far more successful than others. This paper presents an investigation of adaptive modulation in the presence of interference. In particular, the case of non reciprocal interference is studied (i.e., cases where the level of interference is different on the forward and reverse links). Research results have shown that if adaptation is performed assuming a reciprocal channel, then poor performance will result for the link experiencing a higher level of interference. In this study, an algorithm is used to calculate a measure of the link quality. This value is then fed back to the other end of the link to adapt subsequent transmissions. Results indicate that the throughput of such a system can be considerably improved when transmitting adaptively using any one of DBPSK, DQPSK or 8DPSK modulation schemes. It is proposed that this simple approach be adopted for short range, ad hoc, wireless personal area networks (WPAN)."
1007312,20178,369,RLS for Link Trigger in Handover across Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,2011,"The wireless communication system is evolving towards a ubiquitous wireless network in which multiple-radio devices can roam anytime and anywhere across different access networks. Minimal latency and low packet loss ratio during handover (HO) are the indispensable requirements to reduce service disruption and support real-time services. However, minimizing service disruption is a challenging issue to multiple access networks since HO latency is much higher than that of homogeneous networks. Link layer trigger or layer 2 trigger has been proposed to address this issue. Nevertheless, the precise timing and deﬁnitive criteria for initiating L2 trigger which can greatly affect the handover performance is not specified. This paper considers the issue of how to timely initiate handover decision from the link layer by using adaptive filtering algorithm to predict forthcoming received signal. Particularly, we propose Recursive Least Squares (RLS) as the predictive method for layer 2 triggering and compare its performance with various conventional filtering techniques. A simulation in which the proposed predictive algorithm is implemented to a handover scenario from Wi-Fi to WIMAX is also presented. Our numerical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than that of the other algorithms and can be used to enhance the handover performance in heterogeneous wireless networks."
1414845,20178,10228,Prediction-based handover schemes for relay-enhanced LTE-A systems,2012,"Relay nodes (RN) have been suggested to be placed near the edge of a cellular network in order to improve link qualities of cell edge user equipments (UEs). Compared to conventional homogeneous networks, system performance for the relay-enhanced network can be significantly degraded if handovers between the RNs and evolved node base-station (eNB) are not correctly and immediately determined by the eNB. Therefore, the UEs may suffer from worse channel conditions which can result in increased energy consumption of entire network. In existing long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) standard, fixed reporting time period from the UEs to eNB is considered inflexible which can be too long to provide immediate handover decisions. Hence, prediction-based handover (PH) scheme is proposed to allow eNBs to make potential handover decisions within the UE's reporting period. The channel qualities for both the direct and relay-enhanced links during this period are predicted based on the partially observable Markov decision process. Moreover, three objectives are designed for the proposed PH scheme including maximizing received signal to interference plus noise ratios of UEs, and minimizing system energy consumption without and with considerations of energy outage of relay nodes. Numerical results show that the proposed PH schemes outperform conventional handover scheme from the perspectives of both system energy consumption and outage probability."
1782900,20178,369,Decentralized Market-Based Radio Resource Management in Multi-Network Environments,2007,"For voice, an efficient radio resource management (RRM) essentially boils down to providing a predefined signal to interference ratio (SIR) at lowest cost possible and centralized schemes has, evidently, been an effective approach to address these problems. Delay-elastic data services, however, introduce both heterogeneous user requirements and possibilities for opportunistic RRM. One way, among others, to handle this would be to let autonomous trade-agents, acting on behalf of users, manage the radio resources, and this is our point of departure. We propose a market-based framework for decentralized RRM in environments populated by multiple, possibly heterogeneous, access points (APs), and the provided service for the users consists of file transfers. Resources (transmission time) are partitioned between users through a proportionally fair divisible auction. The problem at hand for the user (trade-agent), is then to determine how much resources it should purchase from the different APs in order to maximize its utility (value for money). Our results indicate that decentralized selfish bidding strategies are able to capitalize on temporary beneficial conditions and offer comparable performance with a centralized scheme (based on the 'muC-rule') that requires knowledge about peak data-rates, queue lengths, and preferences for all users in the system."
1734138,20178,369,Scalable PHY-Layer Security for Distributed Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks,2012,"The problem of binary hypothesis testing is considered in a bandwidth-constrained low-power wireless sensor network operating over insecure links. Observations of the sensors are quantized and encrypted before transmission. The encryption method we propose maps the output of the quantizer to one of the possible quantizer output levels randomly according to a probability matrix. This operation is similar to that of a discrete memoryless channel. The intended (ally) fusion center (AFC) is aware of the encryption keys (probabilities) while the unauthorized (third party) fusion center (TPFC) is not. A constrained optimization problem is formulated from the point of view of AFC in order to design its decision rule along with the encryption probabilities. The objective function to be minimized is the error probability of AFC and the constraint is a lower bound on the error probability of TPFC. A good suboptimal solution to this problem is found. Numerical results are presented to show that it is possible to degrade the error probability of TPFC significantly and still achieve very low probability of error for AFC. As the number of levels in the quantizer increases the performance loss of the secure system compared to insecure system is reduced. Compared to the existing data encryption methods, the proposed method is highly scalable since it does not increase the packet overhead or transmit power of the sensors and has very low computational complexity. A scheme is described to randomize the keys so as to defeat any key space exploration attack."
254965,20178,8228,Inter-cell collaborative spectrum monitoring for cognitive cellular networks in fading environment,2015,"We propose a novel inter-cell power allocation for multi-carrier cognitive cellular networks. The proposed scheme incorporates the network-wide primary service communication activity into sub-channel power allocation. To model the primary service activity we define sub-channel activity index (SAI). SAI is then evaluated through a simple yet efficient collaborative spectrum monitoring scheme with very low signaling overhead. Corresponding to a secondary user transmission over a sub-channel, a utility function is defined which is a decreasing function of SAI, and an increasing function of the sub-channel achievable rate. Optimal power allocation is then formulated to maximize the total secondary base station (SBS) utility, subject to SBS transmit power, and primary system collision probability constraints. The sub-optimal solutions to the non-convex optimization are then obtained utilizing dual decomposition method. Comparing with a cognitive cellular network with no signalling among the SBSs, where SBS adopts equal sub-channel power allocation, simulation results indicate a significant gain on the achievable rate. We further compare the rate performance with an ideal system in which perfect interference channel state, and spectrum sensing information are available at the SBS and a combination of underlay and overlay access techniques are adopted. Comparing to the ideal system, the proposed method requires significantly lower signaling overhead while its rate performance closely follows the ideal access."
1692479,20178,369,Cognitive Optimization Scheme of Coverage for Femtocell Using Multi-Element Antenna,2010,"Recently, femtocell has been proposed as a good solution to increase the coverage area and capacity of the wireless communication system as well as meet the increasing demand for high data rate. The femtocell is low-cost, low-power and can be realized by deploying a femto-base-station connected to the core network via a wired-backhaul. Since the femtocell reuses the macrocell spectrum, co-channel interference between femtocell and macrocell should be taken into consideration first of all. The leakage of femtocell's pilot power to the outside of a residence would cause passing users' handover events and result in increasing load to the network. In this paper, firstly we put forward a simple method for the femtocell to gain recognition of the residence and network environment, and then according to the obtained knowledge the femtocell carries out self-cofiguration and self-optimization for the purpose of achieving an optimized coverage to improve the in door Quality of Service (QoS) and minimum the interference in the existing network. To implement that we bring up a low-cost multi-element antenna solution and a series of corresponding algorithms, which is mainly based on low-complexity shaped beam forming and power adjusting. The simulation results show that the approaches proposed in the paper greatly reduce the femtocell's interference to the macrocell and optimize indoor coverage at the same time. These results can provide guidelines for the deployment of femtocell."
486598,20178,369,Characterization of Ping-Pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM (POPS-OFDM) for 5G Systems,2015,"Due to high mobility situations that are commonly envisaged for the next Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile communication systems, the wireless propagation channel becomes a time-frequency variant, where the time dispersion emerges from the multipath characteristic and the time- selectivity arises from the Doppler spread. This aspect can dramatically damage the waveforms orthogonality that is induced in the Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Consequently, this results in oppressive Inter- Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which leads to performance degradation in OFDM systems. To efficiently overcome these drawbacks, we propose Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM (POPS-OFDM ) algorithm that maximizes the received Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) by optimizing systematically the OFDM waveforms at the Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) sides. We derived the exact closed-form expression of the SINR of the considered multicarrier system and the optimized waveform is searched as a linear combination of several of the most localized Hermite functions. Then, we go further by testing its robustness against time synchronization errors. The results confirm the advantage behind POPS-OFDM algorithm in enhancing spectacular performance and its robustness compared to multicarrier systems using conventional waveforms. Simulations are given to support our claims."
2828693,20178,10228,Evaluation of multiple access strategies with power control error and variable packet length in M2M,2016,"Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is expected to enable billions of devices to be connected by the cellular networks in the near future. The large number of devices involved in M2M will create a huge market potential but at the same time pose some challenges for 3GPP cellular networks. The challenges include massive access management, QoS provisioning, energy/power efficiency, etc. Nowadays, energy-related issues are deemed as the key problems in cellular M2M communications. In this paper, we extend the research framework of [1] by taking into account some important issues that were not yet addressed, mainly the existence of machines with different packet lengths and the effect of imperfect power control. With the proposed system model, we evaluate the power efficiency, energy efficiency and system capacity for uncoordinated CDMA and coordinated FDMA. Through numerical results, we conclude that coordinated FDMA is more resistant to various packet lengths of M2M devices packets in terms of power efficiency and is not influenced by imperfect power control. Thus coordinated multiple strategies, especially FDMA, are more suitable for the future M2M-included cellular networks and deserve further optimization works. With respect to uncoordinated CDMA, although its performance is affected by BS load intensity and power control, it is still a considerable choice due to its simplicity and no signaling overhead, when the BS load intensity is not high and the power control policy is suitable."
328603,20178,369,Low-Complexity Interference-Free Downlink Channel Assignment with Improved Performance in Coordinated Small Cells,2015,"This paper proposes a low-complexity interference-free channel assignment scheme with improved desired downlink performance in coordinated multi-antenna small-coverage access points (APs) that employ the open-access control strategy. The adopted system treats the case when each user can be granted an access to one of the available channels at a time. Moreover, each receive terminal can suppress a limited number of resolvable interfering sources via its highly-correlated receive array. On the other hand, the operation of the deployed APs can be coordinated to serve active users, and the availability of multiple physical channels and the use of uncorrelated transmit antennas at each AP are exploited to improve the performance of supported users. The analysis provides new approaches to use the transmit antenna array at each AP, the multiple physical channels, the receive antenna array at each user in order to identify interference-free channels per each user, and then to select a downlink channel that provides the best possible improved performance. The event of concurrent interference-free channel identification by different users is also treated to further improve the desired link associated with the scheduled user. The analysis considers the practical scenario of imperfect identification of interference-free channel by an active user and/or the imperfectness in scheduling concurrent users requests on the same channel. The developed formulations can be used to study any performance metric and they are applicable for any statistical and geometric channel models."
793280,20178,369,Open Wireless Network Architecture in Radio Access Network,2013,"Continuous evolution of wireless protocol and the increasing unmanaged deployment of small cells (e.g. Pico-cell, femto-cell or Wi-Fi APs) have raised an urgent need to update mobile network architecture. To support such evolvability, we design the Open Wireless Network (OWN), a novel evolved architecture for radio access networks, including UMTS, 802.11 WLAN, etc. The main contribution of this paper is that it separates radio access networks into control plane and data plane, and introduces a unified controller for different radio access networks. The data plane consists of soft base stations and access points (BS/AP). The LTE base station and Wi-Fi access point have been realized on our GPP-based platform. A cloud-based controller works as the control plane. In this paper, the OWN operating system (OWN OS) is designed for the controller to perform the corresponding control functions, and it provides open application interfaces (APIs) for developing customed network management applications. Our current system has already supported remote system configuration, QoE-oriented wireless resource management, mobility management and load balancing in heterogeneous networks, etc. We believe that OWN is a promising architecture to make the wireless network central controlled, QoE-oriented, feasible to evolve and more open to operators and vendors."

2885735,20178,369,Multi-Point Single-User MIMO Transmission Scheme for Communication Systems beyond LTE-Advanced,2016,"Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission schemes are often considered as an effective means to minimize the impact of co-channel interference from neighboring transmission point(s) on the performance of cell-edge users. For Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A), CoMP was defined in Rel 11 and supports three types of transmission schemes: Coordinated Scheduling and Coordinated Beamforming (CS/CB), Joint Transmission (JT) and Dynamic Point Selection (DPS). For JT CoMP with single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), it is generally assumed that the user equipment (UE) receives each MIMO layer from multiple transmission points which apply joint precoding. In practice, however, such joint precoding is not always desirable from the performance perspective and system constraints. Therefore, in this paper we propose an alternative approach of supporting JT CoMP for SU-MIMO. More specifically, it is shown that for spatial multiplexing SU-MIMO transmission schemes it is beneficial to transmit MIMO layers with per-point precoding independently from the neighboring (i.e., non-serving) point(s) in addition to the MIMO layer(s) transmitted by the serving point. For the proposed multi-point SU-MIMO transmission scheme, an original proportional fair scheduling algorithm is developed to achieve load balancing across the cooperating transmission points. Using system-level simulations it is demonstrated that the considered multi-point SU-MIMO transmission scheme can improve the system performance and, therefore, may be considered as a candidate enhancement for next generation (5G) cellular communication systems beyond LTE-Advanced."
2406344,20178,369,Misalignments Feedforward Transmitter Correction Design for Nonlinear Distortion Cancellation in OFDM Systems,2006,"The Feedforward linearization technique is a well-known power amplifier linearization method to reduce out-of-band distortion that can approach wideband signals with high efficiency. The Feedforward structure consists of two loops, where an accurate adjustment between them is necessary to ensure a correct behaviour. This adjustment must remain along the time to compensate for temperature, environmental and operating changes. Amplitude and phase imbalances of the circuit elements in both loops produce mismatched effects that lead to degrade the performance of the Feedforward technique. A method is proposed to compensate for these mismatches, introducing two complex gain coefficients calculated by means of a genetic algorithm. The method is applied to broadband systems based on OFDM modulation schemes. The OFDM transmission is an efficient way to deal with multipath, being its implementation less complex than traditional equalizers. This together with an efficient implementation, using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, has made it ideal for new technology. However, it is also very sensitive to nonlinear distortions due to its greatly variable envelope and high peak to mean envelope power ratio values. Therefore, Feedforward is a good linearization method for OFDM systems because simultaneously offers wide bandwidth and good nonlinear distortion suppression. The method functionality has been verified by means of simulation."
2081858,20178,369,Iterative Water-filling for Load-balancing in Wireless LAN or Microcellular Networks,2006,"This paper presents an efficient iterative load-balancing algorithm for time and bandwidth allocation among access points (APs) and users subject to heterogeneous fairness and application requirements. The algorithm can be carried out either at a central network switch with site-specific propagation predictions, or in a decentralized manner. The algorithm converges to maximum network resource utilization from any starting point, and usually converges in 3 to 9 iterations in various network conditions including users joining, leaving, and moving within a network and various network sizes. Such a fast convergence allows real-time implementations of our algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm has merits over other schemes especially when users exhibit clustered patterns: Our algorithm, when assuming multiple radios at each user, achieves 48% gain of median throughput as compared with the max-min fair load-balancing scheme (also with the multi-radio assumption) while losing 14% of fairness index; we also achieve 26% gain of median throughput and 52% gain of fairness index over the strongest-signal-first scheme (which assumes each user has only a single radio). When only a single radio is used, our algorithm is similar to the max-min fairness scheme, and is still better than SSF with 44% gain of 25-percentile throughput and 37% gain of fairness index"
2461514,20178,369,Performance analysis of variable rate: symbol-by-symbol adaptive bit interleaved coded modulation for Rayleigh fading channels,2002,"A challenging problem for a high-speed data service over wireless is to protect data over the error-prone fading channel in an effective way (high-bandwidth efficiency). We propose a bandwidth-efficient error correction scheme, namely variable rate adaptive bit interleaved coded modulation (ABICM), for the wireless mobile channel. The code rate and modulation level are varied according to the current channel state to exploit the time-varying nature of the wireless channel. Design challenges to achieve symbol-by-symbol adaptation are addressed. In particular, we address the criteria for choosing the family of component codes for the ABICM system. We propose a multilevel puncturing scheme that solves the problem of symbol-by-symbol adaptive puncturing and interleaving. The equivalent distance spectrum for variable rate symbol-by-symbol adaptive codes is introduced and analytical bounds on adaptive codes are derived that enable us to determine the optimal adaptation thresholds. Two operation modes, namely constant throughput and constant bit error rate (BER) controls, are proposed. It is found that there are significant gains relative to fixed-rate coding in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and throughput. It is also found that the ABICM scheme is essentially not degraded when used with small interleaving depths. This makes the ABICM very suitable for real-time applications."
2851692,20178,369,An Accurate and Energy-Efficient Localization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks,2016,"Node location information with high accuracy is very important in many applications of wireless sensor networks. In addition, the nodes are power-limited, hence, we need to save energy to guarantee the operations of network. These two metrics positioning accuracy and energy consumption should be balanced, mean that one should improve them both at the same time. In this paper, we model the energy consumption of nodes in the network by using the carrier-sense multiple-access/collision-avoidance (CSMA/CS) technique in combination with request-to-send (RTS)/clear-to-send (CTS) mechanism based IEEE 802.11 protocol to perform the transmission process of nodes. Otherwise, based on the mathematical model of direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation error variance as a function of Received-Signal-Strength (RSS) we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of achievable accuracy of the target node that jointly utilizes difference-received-signal-strength (DRSS) and DoA measurements to estimate location as the objective function of positioning error. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm can effectively find the Nash Equilibrium or Pareto optimal solutions of our dual objective optimization problem. The results show a high performance in both localization accuracy and energy consumption of the proposed algorithm."
2472473,20178,22021,A new robust transmission technique for the multiuser MIMO downlink,2010,"We present a new robust feedback and transmit strategy for multiuser MIMO downlink communication systems, termed Rate Approximation (RA), and analyze its performance. The new scheme combines flexibility and robustness needed for reliable communications with the user terminal, under a limited feedback constraint. The scheme responds to two major developments in the recent literature: One observation is that it is not so important to approximate the channel but rather the rate itself. The second observation is that a fixed codebook at the transmitter is often better when simultaneously the channel state information is more accurate. Both observations are incorporated in the new scheme where the transmit and feedback codebook are strictly separated and user rates are brought to the base station subject to a controlled uniform error. The analysis provides two astonishing results. First, under perfect channel state information at the transmitter RA outperforms zeroforcing beamforming (ZFBF) for a large fraction of the practically relevant signal-to-noise ratio range for the considered operating point. Second, under a limited feedback constraint the quantization error scaling of RA is shown to be doubly exponentially in the number of feedback bits, whereas the quantization error of ZFBF with random vector quantization was shown by Jindal to scale only exponentially. Simulations sustain our analytic results showing the superior performance of the new scheme."
1175754,20178,369,CQI Maps for Optimized Data Distribution,2013,"The number of connected cars is growing continuously. Many car manufacturers offer systems, which provide online content to the passengers, mostly infotainment and information data. Although new wireless data communications technologies like LTE will offer much more performance, the increasing number of mobile data users in combination with higher individual data traffic will nullify the higher capacities. Mobile data bandwidth will remain a rare commodity. If next generations driver assistance systems should be supplied with data from central servers in time and according to their individual priorities, it is important to make optimal use of the available resources. Considering the changing channel conditions of the wireless links offers potential for improvements, since the channel quality has a direct influence on the utilization of the data channel. HSPA and LTE use the so called Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) as a measure of the channel conditions. Summarized in a map, server-side applications can use a priori knowledge of the location-dependent channel quality to optimize the data distribution to mobile clients. This paper describes the process of creating CQI maps for HSDPA networks, from the initial collection of raw data to the final validation of the proposed concept."
2400367,20178,369,Site independent diversity transmit power control for inter-cell site diversity in W-CDMA forward link,2001,"This paper proposes a new fast transmit power control algorithm for forward link inter-cell site diversity, called site independent diversity transmit power control (hereafter SIDTPC) and compares the effect of decreasing the total transmit signal energy per bit-to-background noise power spectrum density ratio (E/sub b//N/sub 0/) of all cell sites for three methods: SIDTPC, site selection diversity transit power control (SSDT), and conventional TPC during inter-cell site diversity (hereafter CTPC) in the W-CDMA forward link. The SIDTPC method differs from SSDT in that each cell site transmits a dedicated physical channel (DPCH) with different transmit power, which is adaptively weighted according to the path loss between each cell site and a mobile station (MS), that is to say, with larger (smaller) transmit power for the cell having the smaller (larger) path loss, resulting in a decreased total transmit power similar to the SSDT method, while maintaining a superior feature which enables SIDTPC to be less sensitive to the reception errors of the control bits sent via the reverse link. Simulation results demonstrated that when the traffic ratio of voice service to data service is 1:1, the required total average transmit E/sub b//N/sub 0/, at the average block error rate (BLER) of 10/sup -2/ for 50% of MSs using the SIDTPC method is decreased by approximately 0.4 (0.5) dB and 2.0 (0.2) dB compared to those with the CTPC and SSDT methods, respectively, for Doppler frequency, f/sub D/, of 5 (80) Hz."
2669540,20178,369,Indoor Office Plan Environment and Layout-Based mmWave Path Loss Models for 28 GHz and 73 GHz,2016,"This paper presents large-scale path loss models based on extensive ultra-wideband millimeter-wave propagation measurements performed at 28 GHz and 73 GHz in three typical indoor office layouts - namely: corridor, open-plan, and closed-plan. A previous study combined all indoor layouts together, while this study separates them for site-specific indoor large-scale path loss model analysis. Measurements were conducted using a 400 megachips-per-second broadband sliding correlator channel sounder with 800 MHz first null-to-null RF bandwidth for 48 transmitter- receiver location combinations with distances ranging 3.9 m to 45.9 m for both co- and cross-polarized antenna configurations in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight environments. Omnidirectional path loss values were synthesized from over 14,000 directional power delay profiles and were used to generate single-frequency and multi-frequency path loss models for combined, co-, and cross-polarized antennas. Large-scale path loss models that include a cross-polarization discrimination factor are provided for cross-polarized antenna measurements. The results show the value of using the close-in free space reference distance single and multi-frequency path loss models, as they offer simplicity (less parameters) in path loss calculation and prediction, without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, the current 3GPP floating-intercept path loss model only requires a simple and subtle modification to convert to the close-in free space reference distance models."
1846648,20178,369,An MGF-derivative based unified analysis of incoherent diversity reception of M-ary orthogonal signals over fading channels,2001,"Exact error probability expressions for noncoherent M-ary frequency-shift-keying (MFSK) systems that employ postdetection equal-gain diversity over Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami-m channels are derived using a Laplace derivative formula. Both independent and generically correlated fading cases are considered. For independent fading, closed-form solutions are also derived for both Nakagami-q fading (either with identical or dissimilar fading statistics) and mixed fading cases. Previous results are shown to be specific instances of our general expressions. Additionally, a new concise, derivative formula is obtained for calculating the bit error rate of square-law detected multichannel binary differential phase-shift-keying (BDPSK) signals. All these expressions are applicable in many cases of practical interest and provide accurate predictions of the performance of both binary and M-ary orthogonal signalling over generalized fading channels (with arbitrary fading parameters). Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the theory, including the investigation into optimal diversity order in energy-sharing communications, characterization of block orthogonal codes with soft-decision decoding (i.e., MFSK may also be viewed as a form of repetition coding) and analysis of MFSK with space (antenna) diversity."
921595,20178,369,Performance Bounds and Improvements to HARQ in LTE under Unknown and Highly Variable Interference Due to MIMO,2011,"We consider the performance of Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) in LTE in the presence of inter-cell interference (ICI) due to MIMO transmissions. Such ICI is a function of the MIMO transmission parameters used in neighboring cells, including the beamforming vectors used and the powers applied to these vectors. Since these are often adapted for different transmissions and generally not known to neighboring cells, the prevailing ICI and channel quality experienced by users in such scenarios varies and may often be unknown to the transmitter. Systems that can operate efficiently in the presence of variable/unknown ICI levels are therefore of particular interest for such scenarios. We show that MIMO-ICI can be efficiently handled by use of HARQ. However, the 4-Redundancy Version HARQ design of LTE can have a significant loss in throughput with respect to what can be achieved. Handling MIMO-ICI requires a more aggressive use of Incremental Redundancy (IR) that does not target successful decoding in the first few (e.g.~1 to 4) transmissions (TXs). Rather, the system is less reliant on fine-grained control of modulation/code-rate settings, and net TX rates are adapted implicitly with prevailing ICI conditions via the number of TXs (often exceeding 4) required for successful decoding. This points to a fundamentally different, simplified, and higher-throughput system design that is well suited to delay tolerant transmission."
1705705,20178,369,Reducing the Calculation for Precise Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks,2010,"Large numbers of cheap and easily deployable wireless sensors enable area-wide monitoring of both urban environments and inhospitable terrain. Due to the random deployment of these sensor nodes, one of the key issues is their position determination. Noisy distance measurements and the highly limited resources of every sensor node, due to tiny hardware and small battery capacity, demand the development of robust, energy aware, and precise localization algorithms. This paper presents a new fine-grained localization method RAL (Resource Aware Localization Algorithm). This algorithm uses a least squares adjustment approach which significantly reduces the computational and energy requirements of the sensor nodes while simultaneously giving a considerable increase in accuracy. Simulations show that very low localization errors of less than 1% can be achieved. The presented method has been analyzed with three commonly used numerical techniques - Normal Equations (NE), QR-Factorization (QR), and Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD). Numerical simulation results showed that the complexity on every node can be reduced by more than 79% for NE and more than 99% for QRF and SVD. In addition, the proposed algorithm is robust with respect to high input errors and has comparably low communication requirements."
2838343,20178,10228,Performance of MIMO enhanced unipolar OFDM with realistic indoor visible light channel models,2016,"Visible light communication (VLC) involves the dual use of illumination infrastructure for high speed wireless access. Designing such optical based communication systems, realistic indoor optical channel modeling becomes an important issue to be handled. In this paper, first we obtain new realistic indoor VL channel characterizations and models, in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission scenario, using non-sequential ray tracing approach for the channel impulse responses (CIRs). Practical issues such as number of light emitting diode (LED) chips per luminary, spacing between LED chips, objects inside the room and cabling topology are also investigated. On the other hand, since indoor optical channels exhibit frequency selectivity, multi-carrier communication systems, particularly orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used to handle the resulting inter-symbol interference in VLC systems. Hence, we propose a new MIMO-OFDM based VLC system, called MIMO enhanced unipolar OFDM (MIMO-eU-OFDM) by combining MIMO transmission techniques with the recently proposed eU-OFDM scheme. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system is investigated in the presence of the 2 χ 2 and 4 χ 4 realistic MIMO VLC channels and its BER performance is compared with the reference optical MIMO-OFDM systems."
1937752,20178,369,Performance of Orthogonal Beamforming for SDMA With Limited Feedback,2009,"On the multiantenna broadcast channel, the spatial degrees of freedom support simultaneous transmission to multiple users. The optimal multiuser transmission, which is known as dirty paper coding, is not directly realizable. Moreover, close-to-optimal solutions such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding are sensitive to channel state information (CSI) inaccuracy. This paper considers a more practical design called per user unitary and rate control (PU2RC), which has been proposed for emerging cellular standards. PU2RC supports multiuser simultaneous transmission, enables limited feedback, and is capable of exploiting multiuser diversity. Its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding) constraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebook of multiple orthonormal bases. In this paper, the asymptotic throughput scaling laws for PU2RC with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the multiuser interference-limited regime, the throughput of PU2RC is shown to logarithmically scale with the number of users. In the normal SNR and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scale double logarithmically with the number of users and linearly with the number of antennas at the base station. In addition, numerical results show that PU2RC achieves higher throughput and is more robust against CSI quantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming if the number of users is sufficiently large."
2249860,20178,8228,Using Limited Feedback in Power Allocation Design for a Two-Hop Relay OFDM System,2009,"In this paper, we study power allocation (PA) in a single-relay OFDM system with limited feedback. We propose a PA scheme that uses a codebook of quantized PA vectors designed offline and known to the source, relay, and destination. The destination, which has full knowledge of channel side information (CSI), chooses one of the codebook vectors and conveys back to the source and relay. With the limited amount of available feedback, the design of an appropriate codebook is central to PA, which varies depending on the destination's strategy to choose the optimal PA vector. Assuming high received SNR on either link in the relay path, we first derive the optimal PA solutions as the function of channel realizations with two design criteria, maximizing capacity and minimizing error rate. It is found that when there is high received SNR in either the relay path or the direct path, the optimal solutions for both criteria reduce to simple forms. For maximizing capacity, the available power should be equally allocated to each OFDM subcarrier shared by the source and relay; while for minimum error rate, the available power should be allocated such that the received SNRs for all subcarriers at the destination are the same. The findings lead us to the sub-optimal solutions with great complexity reduction. We then present an adaptation of Lloyd's algorithm to construct a codebook to quantize the optimal PA vectors subject to the amount of feedback. Simulations show that a mild to negligible performance loss can be achieved with only a few bits of feedback at different SNR values."
2039720,20178,369,Field Experiment Results for Rotational OFDM Transmission Implemented on 100 MHz Bandwidth Testbed toward IMT-Advanced System,2009,"This paper presents field experiment results for rotational orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (R-OFDM) transmission and demonstrates that R-OFDM is superior to conventional OFDM even in actual radio transmission. R-OFDM is a multi-carrier transmission scheme proposed by the authors. It is characterized by the use of rotational code division multiplexing that enables OFDM to obtain suitable frequency diversity gain. The authors previously implemented R-OFDM on a 100 MHz bandwidth testbed system and evaluated it in the laboratory. Measured results were in good agreement with simulation results. In addition, although the laboratory measurements made it clear that R-OFDM is superior to OFDM, the results assumed the typical radio channel conditions provided by a fading simulator. In order to confirm the effectiveness of R-OFDM, field experiments are indispensable. Therefore, this paper conducts field experiments with a measurement vehicle driven under conditions where OFDM demands frequency diversity. When the coverage of R-OFDM is measured, coverage with a packet error rate (PER) of 1% with OFDM is expanded by 12%. In addition, the measured PER performance against the measured signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) clarifies that, by using R-OFDM, the SNR required to obtain a PER of 1% can be reduced by 3.3 dB compared with OFDM. Furthermore, OFDM throughput under severe SNR conditions can be improved by R-OFDM and R-OFDM throughput achieves 1.6 times as large as OFDM throughput.

2094384,20178,8228,On Power/Bandwidth Efficient Clipped-OFDM and SC/FDE Transmission Schemes with Reduced CP Overhead,2008,"In this paper, we consider two reduced-PMEPR (peak to mean envelope power ratio), reduced-CP (cyclic prefix) block transmission alternatives, having in mind an application to the uplink of future mobile broadband systems: clipped (and filtered) OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) and SC/FDE (single carrier/frequency-domain equalization). In both cases, we adopt advanced receivers with space diversity and a similar structure, where an iterative cancellation of unavoidable interferences is carried out: interference due to a CP length below the channel memory order, in both cases; deliberate nonlinear interference, in the clipped-OFDM case; residual linear ISI, in the SC/FDE case. Performance results, when a 16-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) constellation is adopted in both cases, are reported and discussed, with the help of selected performance bounds. These results show that we can add the benefits of a reduced CP to those of a reduced PMEPR, through the use of the proposed iterative receiver techniques, thereby providing a highly power/bandwidth efficient block transmission, with both clipped-OFDM and SC/FDE schemes. The proposed OFDM receiver technique is shown to ensure the feasibility of a clipping effort strong enough to reduce the OFDM PMEPR to a level below that of the corresponding SC/FDE scheme; however, it is not able to prevent an overall advantage for the SC/FDE side, namely under a strongly reduced CP overhead."
1816753,20178,369,Testbed Evaluation of Dynamic GGSN Load Balancing for High Bitrate 3G/UMTS Networks,2011,"Telecom operators and vendors predict that mobile networks will suffer a serious IP traffic explosion in the very near future. Besides designing, standardizing and deploying novel architectures like LTE/EPC, also radio access and core network technologies of existing communication systems must be extended in order to make them able to serve the expected traffic demands within limited expenditure growth. In this paper we present the implementation and real-life testbed evaluation results of a special technique aiming to enhance existing 3G/UMTS core network mechanisms by enabling GGSN with a dynamic load balancing and load sharing feature. The novelty of this implementation (i.e., its dynamic nature) lies in the fact that it makes the system able to balance the load not only in terms of active mobile nodes or number of serving contexts, but also based on the actual traffic characteristics of active mobile terminals. Our results show that the deployment of such an advanced GGSN scheme could significantly improve throughput and scalability of the overall packet switched domain in operator based 3G/UMTS environments, as it decreases the average packet latency by dynamically choosing between multiple GGSNs according to the real traffic load."
773723,20178,369,An Efficient Inter-Cell Interference Coordination Scheme in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks,2012,"As a mainstream technology in the 4G TDD (Time Division Duplex) systems, TD-LTE (Long Term Evolution) introduces heterogeneous network topology, utilizing a diverse set of base stations, to improve spectral efficiency per unit area. In heterogeneous network deployment comprised of macrocell and picocell, inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) is very important to significantly improve the system and cell-edge throughput. Moreover, variety of complex situation of inter-cell interference (ICI) occurs in heterogeneous TDD LTE cellular networks due to different downlink/uplink (DL/UL) sub-frame configurations of macrocell and picocell. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient ICIC scheme consisting of four sub-schemes according to relevant interference scenarios based on different sub-frame configurations. The scheme first analyzes interference level and finds out strong interference for each scenario. The basic idea of ICIC is that only primary interfering sources of each scenario avoid using the same frequency resource occupied by interfered victim, and other interfering sources can reuse frequency resource. Numerical results show that our proposed ICIC scheme can not only improve performance of whole region including macrocell area and picocell area, but also significantly achieve higher throughput for cell edge users."
1997045,20178,8228,Contrasting Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Power Control Performance in UTRAN LTE Uplink by UE Trace Analysis,2009,"Uplink power control in UTRAN Long Term Evolution consists of an open-loop scheme handled by the User Equipment and closed-loop power corrections determined and signaled by the network. In this study the difference in performance between pure open-loop and combined open and closed-loop power control has been analyzed and the different behavior of fractional vs. full path-loss compensation has been evaluated. A comprehensive system level simulation model has been used with a facility to trace a particular test user during its motion from eNodeB towards the cell border and back to its initial position. This study demonstrates the effect of distance path-loss of a test user on several physical layer performance metrics including throughput, resource allocation as well as modulation and coding scheme utilization. Simulation results in a fully loaded network show high throughput for open-loop fractional power control for the user located in the vicinity of the serving eNodeB, however, steep performance degradation has been observed when the user is moving towards the cell edge. The user throughput at the cell border can be increased by the closed-loop component. The benefit of closed-loop power control is the higher homogeneity in terms of throughput across the entire network area and the ability to automatically stabilize the network performance under different conditions like cell load and traffic distribution."
2095766,20178,369,Computationally efficient smart antennas for CDMA wireless communications,2001,"The analysis in this paper concerns the performance of smart antenna algorithms when used in code-division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communication systems. Complex pseudonoise (PN) spreading, despreading, and pilot-aided channel estimates in the cdma2000 reverse link are some of major characteristics that are different from those in the IS-95 CDMA systems. These different features are included in our analysis. Four computationally efficient smart antenna algorithms are introduced: 1) smart antenna based on maximum output power criteria without Lagrange multiplier; 2) smart antenna based on maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise output power ratio (SINR) criteria with eigenvector solution; 3) smart antenna based on maximum SINR output criteria without eigenvector solution; 4) more simplified smart antenna based on maximum SINR output criteria without eigenvector solution. Algorithms (1) and (4) require only 4M computational instruction cycles per snapshot where M is the number of antenna array elements. Algorithms (2) and (3) require M/sup 2/ and (4M+2M/sup 2/) operations per snapshot, respectively. These computational loads are significantly smaller than those of typical eigenvalue decomposition blind detection approaches. Bit error rates (BERs) resulting from these algorithms are evaluated through simulation. A double spike power delay profile with equal or unequal power is used. Also, a cluster of interfering users and scattered interference users are considered. For BER comparisons, antenna diversity using equal gain combining is also analyzed. The four smart antenna algorithms show significant capacity improvement compared to the antenna array diversity using equal gain combining under the double spike power delay profile with equal power and scattered interference environments."
1641312,20178,369,Throughput Performance of Iterative Frequency-Domain SIC with 2D MMSE-FDE for SC-MIMO Multiplexing,2006,"Broadband wireless packet access will be the core technology of the next generation mobile communication systems. For very high-speed and high-quality packet transmissions in a limited bandwidth, the joint use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing and hybrid ARQ (HARQ) is an effective method. However, if single-carrier (SC) transmission is used, the transmission performance significantly degrades due to a large inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from a severe frequency-selective fading. In this paper, we propose an iterative frequency-domain successive interference cancellation (SIC) with two dimensional (2D) MMSE-FDE. At each iteration stage, the successive signal detection/cancellation is performed according to the descending order of the signal reliability. However, since the interference from the other transmit antennas can be only partially cancelled by performing SIC, the residual interference is present at the output of SIC. In this paper, we propose to update the 2D MMSE-FDE weights at each signal detection in order to suppress simultaneously the ISI and the interference from other antennas while obtaining antenna and frequency diversity gain. However, since a single use of SIC with 2D MMSE-FDE is insufficient, it is repeated a sufficient number of times. The bit error rate (BER) and HARQ throughput performance in a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel are evaluated by computer simulation."
2823639,20178,369,Mobility Prediction of Diurnal Users for Enabling Context Aware Resource Allocation,2016,"Mobile communication is one of the most ubiquitously used technologies in today's world, evolving towards its fifth generation (5G). Amidst increasing number of devices and traffic volume, one of the key focuses of 5G is to provide uniform service quality despite high mobility. In real world scenarios, user mobility is not random but rather direction oriented, based on its origin and destination. Further, several users exhibit repeated mobility patterns on daily basis (e.g., office goers, commuters in public transport etc.). Such mobility is termed as Diurnal mobility. Information of such diurnal mobility can assist in improving prediction accuracy of future user location (e.g., cells, routes). Knowledge of future user location will enable the designing of efficient resource management algorithms, aiming to make great service quality follow the user. In the presented work, information of diurnal mobility is used to enhance the accuracy of mobility prediction (next cell prediction as well as route prediction) in a realistic urban scenario. Further, using this context information about future routes and possible coverage holes in them, efficient resource allocation is done to sustain streaming/full buffer services, even in coverage holes. The simulation results show substantial improvements in user throughput as a result of context aware resource allocation, enabled by diurnal user mobility prediction."
1194442,20178,369,MMSE-SIC Transceiver Design in Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems,2010,"Most precoding schemes in amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems only consider the relay precoder, and the receiver is often linear. In this paper, we propose a joint source/relay precoders design method for a nonlinear minimum-mean-squared-error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receiver. It is shown that a direct minimization of the average bit-error-rate (BER) is not feasible. Using the uniform channel decomposition (UCD) method, we can design the source and relay precoders such that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each layer is equal and the block BER (BLER) can be minimized. Unlike UCD in conventional MIMO systems, two precoders have to be optimized simultaneously and the optimum solution is still difficult to derive. We then propose to adopt the primal decomposition method decomposing the original problem into a master and a subproblem optimizations. To facilitate the optimization, we propose a unitary source precoder such that the subproblem can be analytically solved, and the source precoder can be expressed as a function of the relay precoder. Then, with a proposed relay precoder structure, the master problem can be translated into a standard concave optimization problem. By Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we can finally obtain the closed-form solutions for the relay and source precoders. Simulations show that the proposed design can outperform existing precoding methods in AF MIMO relay systems."
808310,20178,369,Scheduling in multimedia CDMA wireless networks,2003,"Wireless systems in the future will have to provide multimedia services where different users have different physical-layer quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g., bit energy per interference power density, E/sub b//N/sub 0/, or bit error rate and power constraints) and network-layer QoS requirements (e.g., delay bound, delay-jitter, throughput, and loss). We investigate the use of power control, processing gain and/or multiple codes, and scheduling in CDMA systems to accommodate these diverse service requirements. We first show that the instantaneous capacity region, given in terms of the set of user bit rates that can be supported simultaneously subject to peak power and E/sub b//N/sub 0/ constraints, is nonconvex. This suggests that by time-sharing the channel, one may be able to get better system throughput. We define the capacity region as the convex hull of the instantaneous capacity region and we show that it may be obtained by time sharing between operating points, where each user either uses full power or is silent (bang-bang control). We then consider the problem of scheduling so as to meet prespecified delay bounds or minimum service curve requirements for traffic streams, which are specified in terms of a traffic profile such as a sigma-rho constraint (enforced by a leaky bucket) and a guarantee that the system is stable."
847776,20178,369,Resource Management in 4G Wireless Communications at Vehicular Speeds: A Game Theory Solution,2012,"Poor cell-edge throughput is a well recognized problem in wireless communication technologies including 4G. Inter-cell interference (ICI), low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and inability to use an efficient modulation scheme in a low SNR environment are major problems in cell-edge regions in a multi- cell communication environment, which severely limits the spectral efficiency and cell-edge throughput. Mobility at vehicular speeds adds another dimension of problem for cell-edge users mainly because bit error rate increases exponentially with increasing vehicular speeds due to the multipath problem. 4G standards like LTE-A and WiMAX are currently considering various options to address this problem of low cell-edge throughput. One such option is to split the total radio resource among the cell center and cell-edge region, which allows frequency reuse, reduces ICI in cell-edge area, and supports CoMP transmission. In this paper, we show that simple resource splitting strategy like this, is not sufficient to support wireless communications at vehicular speeds. We propose a game theoretic model to resource management in 4G networks, which works well with nodes moving at high vehicular speeds. The ultimate benefit of the proposed scheme includes lower connection dropping rates for mobile nodes and higher revenue return for the service providers."
1897286,20178,369,Inter GW Load Balancing for Next Generation Mobile Networks with Flat Architecture,2009,"With rapid growth of mobile users and develop- ments of mobile equipments like cell phones, laptops and person- al digits assistances (PDA), mobile networks have to meet dra- matically increased service demands in the nearest future. The ever-increasing demands, such as the users expect to enjoy the service anywhere, anytime and the networks support a seamless mobility, driving the evolution of mobile networks at a fast pace. The next generation mobile network (LTE in 3GPP) is conduct- ing research towards this goal. An IP protocol based flatter net- work architecture has been introduced in the next generation mobile networks (NGMN). In this network architecture, gateway (GW) is the only node which establishes a connection between RAN and external world. To provide capabilities of gateways catering for service demand at different stages, more advanced functions such as load balancing between gateways is proposed. Such mechanism will be used as a solution to avoid gateways congestion and optimize network performance for the future network. In this paper, based on the described flat architecture of the next generation mobile networks and some related concepts such as the pool of gateway, inter-GW load balancing approach has been introduced followed by performance evaluation. Simulation re- sults show promising gains provided by the inter-GW load ba- lancing mechanism for next generation systems."
2551987,20178,369,Space-time signaling for high data rates in EDGE,2002,"Several space-time coding and processing techniques have been introduced in the literature for enhancing the capacity of wireless systems through antenna diversity or spatial multiplexing. We study the application of such techniques to an adaptive coded modulation system in multipath channels with intersymbol interference. One of the key requirements for application of these schemes is the use of appropriate training symbols for channel estimation at the receiver. We determine the training requirements for coherent receiver operation when multiple transmit antennas are used. We show that for the special case of the delay diversity scheme, transmitting the same training sequence from the two antennas is optimal. For more general schemes, we present training sequences that have good auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties that can be used in a practical system such as Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution (EDGE). We present detailed link level simulations that include channel estimation for the proposed schemes. We then determine the system throughput that is achieved for packet data with ideal link adaptation for deployment scenarios with 1/3, 3/9, 4/12, and 7/21 frequency reuse. We conclude that the gains from transmit diversity are not significant when there is frequency hopping as in an EDGE system and that a factor of 3 gain in throughput can be achieved when four transmit and four receive antennas are available using simple space-time transmission and receiver processing."
473234,20178,8228,The impact of inter-site distance and Time-to-Trigger on Handover performance in LTE-A HetNets,2015,"Future cellular networks as envisaged by mobile operators, are expected to consist of macro cells overlaid with small nodes in dense architectures. These multi-tier deployments pose challenges to Mobility Management procedures like Handover, since traditional algorithms fail to keep up with heterogeneity, thus causing degradations in Handover performance. Finding ways to reduce unnecessary Handovers, mainly for fast moving users, and boost offloading of the lower speed ones to small cells, are subjects undergoing intense study. Most studies propose solutions based on the appropriate selection of the key parameters involved in the Handover procedure, such as the Hysteresis Margin and Time-to-Trigger. However, they do not take into account the impact that inter-site distance has on the Handover performance. In this framework, we study the dependency of the Handover procedure on the inter-site distance between a small cell and the overlaid macro cell in a two-tier deployment. Moreover, a Handover performance analysis in terms of Handover, Radio Link Failure, Handover Failure and Ping-Pong probabilities is carried out and evaluated through extensive simulations. Finally, the impact of TTT on the Handover performance is presented, while it is concluded that the appropriate TTT value should be selected according to inter-site distance, user profile (i.e speed) and overall mobility in the network automatically and in line with the concept of Self-Organized Networks (SON)."
650224,20178,369,RF Impairments Compensation and Channel Estimation in MIMO-OFDM Systems,2011,"The application of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) technology in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems provides better spectral efficiency with high capacity gain. It also introduces significant complexity at the transceivers which can be partially reduced using homodyne or zero-IF receivers. However, those transceivers are very sensitive to imperfections of analog components at the RF front end and suffer severe performance degradation in the presence of RF impairments. Two of the most common impairments that significantly limit the performance of MIMO-OFDM transceivers are IQ-Imbalance and phase noise. In this paper, we propose a joint estimation and compensation technique to estimate channel, phase noise and IQ-Imbalance parameters in MIMO-OFDM systems under multipath slow fading channels. A subcarrier multiplexed preamble structure to estimate the channel and impairment parameters with minimum overhead is introduced and used in the estimation of IQ-Imbalance parameters as well as the initial estimation of effective channel matrix including common phase error (CPE). We then use a novel tracking method using pilot subcarriers to update the effective channel matrix throughout an OFDM frame. Simulation results for a variety of scenarios indicate that the proposed estimation and compensation technique efficiently improves the performance of MIMO-OFDM systems in terms of bit- error-rate (BER) as compared with the non- compensated case."
2698344,20178,23712,Streaming Lower Quality Video over LTE: How Much Energy Can You Save?,2015,"Streaming video content over cellular connectivity impacts the battery consumption of a client (e.g., a smartphone). The problem is exacerbated when the channel quality is poor because of a large number of retransmissions, moreover, streaming high quality video in such cases can negatively impact user experience (e.g., due to stalling). In this paper, we develop an analytical framework which can provide the user with an estimate of how much energy she can save by choosing to view a lower quality stream of the video she wishes to view. The framework takes as input the network conditions (in terms of packet error rate or PER) and a coarse characterization of the video to be viewed (slow versus fast motion, resolution), and yields as output the energy savings with different resolutions of the video to be viewed. Thus empowered, the user can then make a quick, educated decision on the version of the video to view. We validate that our framework is extremely accurate in estimating the energy consumption via both simulations, and experiments on smartphones (within ~ 5% of real measurements). We find that switching to a lower resolution video can potentially lead to ~ 418 mW (23.2%) decrease in the consumed power for slow motion video, and ~ 480 mW (26%) for fast motion video in bad channel conditions. This translates to an energy savings of 376.2 J and 432 J respectively, for video clips that are 15 minutes long."
1709107,20178,369,Cramer-Rao Bounds for Hybrid RSS-DOA Based Emitter Location and Transmit Power Estimation in Cognitive Radio Systems,2013,"In this paper, we consider cooperating secondary users (SUs) that are estimating the location and transmit power of an emitter that may be either a primary user (PU) or another SU in the cognitive radio (CR) context. Since SU devices need to be affordable and portable, their capabilities to estimate e.g. the direction of arrival (DOA) are very limited. In addition, the geographical distribution of SUs is random rather than optimized resulting in very stringent conditions for the localization. We therefore analyze possible benefits and performance of hybrid received signal strength (RSS)- DOA based emitter transmit power and position estimation by means of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We show that the RSS-DOA hybrid approach can lead to significantly lower bounds compared to estimation based on only RSS or DOA. Assuming a special case of two SUs at equal distance from the emitter, we derive the CRBs in closed-form and demonstrate that for certain SU-emitter geometries, the RSS-only and DOA-only CRBs become infinite due to the inability to estimate one of the emitter's coordinates. Since those coordinates are orthogonal for RSS and DOA, the hybrid approach does not suffer from these geometries, resulting in a finite CRB. Results from Monte-Carlo simulations are provided which illustrate that significant theoretic gains are possible also for random SU and emitter placements. The results also show that biggest performance gains from joint processing of RSS and DOA are available when the number of cooperating SUs is fairly small, in the order of 2-5."
778092,20178,369,Adaptive Modulation and Turbo Coding for 3GPP LTE Systems with Limited Feedback,2014,"Link adaptation is recognized as a powerful tech- nique for enhancing spectral efficiency over wireless channels. While its theoretical aspects are well understood, it is not clear yet how to practically deal with limited feedback. In this paper, we study a frequency-selective link adaptation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The modulation order is adjusted per resource block (smallest time-frequency unit assigned to a user), while a joint coding rate is used for all variable-length codewords, comprising resource blocks with different modulations. In order to meet the required coding rate, adaptive puncturing is applied after a fixed-rate Turbo encoder. Link adaptation is guided by an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is calculated over several subcarriers by a mapping function. 3GPP LTE compliant link-layer simulations were performed for optimizing the SNR interface so that the spectral efficiency is maximized under a codeword error rate constraint and tradeoffs between feedback savings and spectral efficiency losses were elaborated. The result is a thoroughly tested link-layer abstraction for 3GPP LTE including adaptive modulation and bit-interleaved coding that can be also used for system-level simulations towards future mobile radio systems."
2847685,20178,369,Pattern Design in Joint Space Domain and Power Domain for Novel Multiple Access,2016,"Abstract-- As a promising radio access technology for future 5G network, novel multiple access (NMA) is aimed to improve spectrum efficiency and access capability via design of successive interference cancellation (SIC) amenable pattern in single domain (e.g. power domain, code domain, and space domain) or joint multiple domains. In this paper, a pattern in joint space and power domain is designed for NMA system. The proposed pattern jointly adopts a quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (Q-OSTBC) in space domain and power allocation (PA) scheme for users in power domain, which is in conjunction with SIC based linear receiver. The pattern utilizes Q-OSTBC with unequal diversity order to mitigate the error propagation in the SIC based detector for each user, and PA for multiple users with different channel gain to improve the spectrum efficiency. Simulation results show that the designed pattern can effectively mitigate error propagation in SIC based system. We also investigate the performance of SIC based receiver with or without channel decoding during the reconstruction of interference, simulation results indicate that the reconstruction with decoding outperform the one without decoding, especially under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Due to the diversity gain, the NMA system using the designed pattern can obtain higher average sum rate compared to its counterpart, i.e. the combination of Vertical Bell Layered Space-Time code (VBLAST) and PA."
2050240,20178,369,On BER analysis of the BLAST without optimal ordering over Rayleigh fading channel,2004,"The BLAST algorithm is a simple and, hence, popular solution for signal processing at the MIMO receiver. Its BER performance has been studied mainly using numerical (Monte-Carlo) techniques since exact analytical analysis presents serious difficulties. Close examination of the problem of BLAST BER performance analysis reveals that the major difficulty for analytical analysis is due to the optimal ordering procedure. Hence, we analyze the algorithm performance without optimal ordering. While this is a disadvantage of the analysis, there are certain advantages as well. Exact closed-form analytical analysis is possible in the general case of m/spl times/n system for the iid (independent and identically distributed) Rayleigh channel, which provides deep insight and understanding that cannot be gained using the Monte-Carlo approach alone. We present closed-form expressions for instantaneous and average BER at each detection step, which hold true for any modulation format and take the simple form in some cases (i.e. BPSK, QPSK, BFSK, etc.). Asymptotic form (for large SNR) of these expressions is especially simple. As expected, the first-step BER dominates the total BER and D-BLAST provides some improvement over V-BLAST in terms of the worst BER, which, however, disappears asymptotically. We stress that these conclusions hold true for any modulation. Comparison to the V-BLAST with optimal ordering allows to better understand the advantages provided by the optimal ordering procedure."
2409580,20178,8228,Uplink Resource Allocation for Frequency Selective Channels and Fractional Power Control in LTE,2011,"We consider the allocation of spectral and power resources every subframe (1~ms) on the uplink of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) wideband orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular network. System bandwidth is divided into multiple sub-bands. The fractional power control to manage interference is allowed to be a function of the sub-band. Moreover, the channel gains from the base-station to the mobiles (user equipment (UE) in LTE) can vary with the sub-band. The power and spectral resources are to be allocated among different UEs in a cell based on channel conditions, desired fairness/QoS, and constraints on power due to interference and power limitation at a UE. For $N$ UEs and $M$ sub-bands, we exploit the structure of the underlying optimization problem to obtain an $O(NM)$ algorithm for optimal resource allocation when a UE can be allocated resources in a non-contiguous manner in frequency. To implement this in an OFDMA system, we delineate a simple control signalling structure where the UE computes in $O(M)$ time a waterfilling solution every subframe it is assigned resources. When the allocation is restricted to contiguous allocation in frequency due to single carrier constraint in LTE, we convert the solution computed above in $O(NM)$ time into a feasible solution. For typical network scenarios, the solution thus computed is numerically shown to be very close to the optimal solution with no restrictions."
2134409,20178,369,Optimal Signal Sampling Configuration for MEMS INS/GPS Navigation,2006,"For vehicle navigation, Global Positioning System (GPS) provides long term accurate measurements, but only when a direct line of sight to four or more satellites exists. Inertial navigation systems (INS), on the other hand, are self contained sensors that can provide short term measurements. The integration of the two systems can effectively provide continuous navigation data even during GPS signal outages. Traditional INSs are bulky and expensive, and therefore, can not be used for daily civilian applications. With the evolution of MEMS technology, MEMS-based INS sensors are evolving into more accurate, compact and inexpensive units. Hence, there is a growing interest in exploring the capabilities of these sensors in the field of vehicle navigation. Most of the research is targeted towards finding the best error models and integration techniques that can reduce the high drift and errors associated with these sensors. One of the important aspects of this integration is the optimal configuration for sampling frequency, number of bits and time delay during recording of the various sensor outputs. The very low cost of the MEMS sensors makes the cost of the signal sampling, i.e. analog to digital conversion (ADC), an issue. These parameters will reduce the on-board memory requirement, speed up the computation and hence, significantly reduce the final cost to the consumers."
2337046,20178,369,First Survey Results of Quantified User Behavior in User-in-the-Loop Scenarios for Sustainable Wireless Networks,2012,"Traffic in mobile radio networks is expected to continue to increase by 100% per year. This imposes a big challenge for future generations (4G and 5G) of access technologies which were previously dimensioned for over-provisioning especially in the busy hours. Recent forecasts hint that this assumption and approach will not be tractable anymore. Instead the demand will exceed the supply more and more frequently causing congestion not only in short term but over longer periods of time. Any approach to engineer networks greener by better spectral efficiency only will fail to meet the global objective, if demand keeps on increasing faster than supply and efficiency. Instead, the User-in-the-loop approach allows to shape the demand where it originates either in space or time. This is achieved by incentives for users to change location or by dynamic tariffs to shift the use of congested resources out of the busy hours. This works as the smart grid of communications. While some work has already been done in this new field, the user behavior to the controlled demand shaping was based on assumptions. In this paper, the assumptions were confirmed by recent survey results which indicate that shaping user behavior works sufficiently well. Models of the user response are given and analysis and simulation results show the advantages and gains of this approach."
2419949,20178,369,Phase modeling of indoor radio propagation channels,1994,"Two models for generating phase of individual multipath components in an indoor environment, partly developed in Hashemi (1993), have been studied in detail. In the deterministic phase increment model (model I), the phase of each multipath component is updated deterministically using several independent random scatterers. In the random phase increment model (model II), the phase of each multipath component is updated by adding independent random phase increments. Performance of these models has been evaluated by means of extensive computer simulations. Statistical properties of narrow-band CW fading signals obtained using each phase model have been compared with the corresponding results for a large empirical wide-band database of 12000 impulse response estimates of indoor radio propagation channels. A major conclusion is that model I (with five scatterers for each multipath component) and model II (with proper choice for phase increments) provide fading results consistent with those obtained from measurements. In this paper, properties of each phase model are described, and an algorithm for generating each is presented. Firstand second-order statistics [amplitude distributions, level crossing rates (LCRs), and average duration of fades (ADFs)] and Doppler spectra of narrow-band CW fading waveforms obtained using simulated phases are reported, and detailed comparison between the simulated and empirical results is carried out. Furthermore, the two models are also compared with each other, and advantages and disadvantages of each are explored. The effect of increasing the number of scatterers and statistical properties of phase increments in model I are studied, simulated, and compared with model II. A major conclusion is that for an appropriate choice of parameters, both models provide satisfactory performance."
2384118,20178,369,QoS-Aware User Association for Load Balancing in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks,2014,"To solve the problem that the low capacity in hot-spots and coverage holes of conventional cellular networks, the base stations (BSs) having lower transmit power are deployed to form heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). However, because of these introduced disparate power BSs, the user distributions among them looked fairly unbalanced if an appropriate user association scheme hasn't been provided. For effectively tackling this problem, we jointly consider the load of each BS and user's achievable rate instead of only utilizing the latter when designing an association algorithm, and formulate it as a network-wide weighted utility maximization problem. Note that, the load mentioned above relates to the amount of required subbands decided by actual rate requirements, i.e., QoS, but the number of associated users, thus it can reflect user's actual load level. As for the proposed problem, we give a maximum probability (max-probability) algorithm by relaxing variables as well as a low-complexity distributed algorithm with a near-optimal solution that provides a theoretical performance guarantee. Experimental results show that, compared with the association strategy advocated by Ye, our strategy has a speeder convergence rate, a lower call blocking probability and a higher load balancing level."
2069942,20178,8228,SCS-MC-CDMA system with best effort cell structure,2005,"This paper proposes SCS-MC-CDMA system with best effort cell structure. 4th generation mobile communication (4G) system is expected to offer 100 Mbps or higher data rate communication in the high-frequency microwave band. The system is characterized by relatively long delay paths, high maximum Doppler frequency, high power consumption at the mobile terminals and small cell coverage caused by the high data transmission rates and the high-frequency band. All of these are serious problems that must be solved. The proposed SCS-MC-CDMA system can realize high communication quality even under delay spreads as long as a few microseconds and maximum Doppler frequency as high as 1000 Hz. Channel estimation is accurate since code-multiplexed pilot symbols are used, and MMSEC is adopted to reduce inter-code interference. Concerning power consumption, the system can assign a number of sub-carriers, which may be narrower than the whole bandwidth of the system, to each user according to the user's data rate requirements. This lowers the power consumption, especially for low data rate users such as voice users. Moreover, the best effort cell structure overcomes the small cell coverage issue by changing the maximum data rate for each user adoptively according to his distance from the base station or channel quality."
3039004,20178,369,Modelling of Communication Reliability for Platooning Applications for Intelligent Transport System,2016,"Vehicle platooning using reliable wireless communication between the member vehicles is a promising method to increase road capacity, lower fuel consumption, and improve safety and driver comfort. IEEE 802.11p is a key communication technology in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) applications. The broadcasted awareness messages in the wireless communication channel may be used for platooning control, but there are reliability concerns especially in a highly congested network in rush hours. Keeping short inter-vehicle distance requires timeliness and reliability of the underlying exchange of control data in the communication channel. In this paper, we present a novel analytical model of communication reliability between platoon members in a channel shared with other vehicles using ITS. We use a discrete time M/G/1 queue model for occurrence of messages in Poisson distribution, and hence for the estimation of the Packet Reception Probability between the platoon members. We have evaluated the model for different vehicular densities, message rate and data rate with network simulations. Our results show that the Packet Reception Rate (PRR) from the model closely matches the simulation results. Based on PRR we estimate probability of missing packet in consecutive period of transmission. This model opens new opportunities to improve and evaluate the platooning control algorithms."
1202532,20178,369,Performance of iterative data detection and channel estimation for single-antenna and multiple-antennas wireless communications,2004,"In iterative data-detection and channel-estimation algorithms, the channel estimator and the data detector recursively exchange information in order to improve the system performance. While a vast bulk of the available literature demonstrates the merits of iterative schemes through computer simulations, in this paper analytical results on the performance of an iterative detection/estimation scheme are presented. In particular, this paper focus is on uncoded systems and both the situations that the receiver and the transmitter are equipped with either a single antenna or multiple antennas are considered. With regard to the channel estimator, the analysis considers both the minimum mean square error and the maximum likelihood channel estimate, while, with regard to the data detector, linear receiver interfaces are considered. Closed-form formulas are given for the channel-estimation mean-square error and for its Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound, as well as for the error probability of the data detector. Moreover, the problem of the optimal choice of the length of the training sequence is also addressed. Overall, results show that the considered iterative strategy achieves excellent performance and permits, at the price of some complexity increase, the use of very short training sequences without incurring any performance loss. Finally, computer simulations reveal that the experimental results are in perfect agreement with those predicted by the theoretical analysis."
1862838,20178,369,Improved Markov Chain MBER Detection for Steered Linear Dispersion Coded MIMO Systems,2009,"In this paper, we present an iterative Markov Chain Minimum Bit Error Rate (MC-MBER) detection aided steered Linear Dispersion Coded (LDC) structure, which amalgamates three different Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) func- tions, namely Space-Time Coding (STC), Spatial Division Mul- tiplexing (SDM) and beamforming. Furthermore, the concept of using an ovel ap rioriLog Likelihood Ratio (LLR) threshold based technique is invoked for the sake of further reducing the com- putational complexity imposed. Both the EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and our BER performance results demonstrate that the achievable performance is substantially improved upon increasing the number of iterations I. At BER = 1×10 �4 , the required Eb/N0 value is about 2.4 dB apart from that of the maximum achievable rate in conjunction with I =1 0 in a rank-deficient system transmitting Q = 6 QPSK modulated streams in T = 2 symbol durations with the aid of N = 2 receive antennas and M = 2 transmit antenna arrays, where each of the arrays is composed of L = 2 antenna elements. It is demonstrated that the computational complexity of the ap riori LLR threshold assisted MC-MBER detector is reduced by 38% at BER = 1.4×10 �5 in comparison to that of the MC-MBER detector dispensing with the thresholding technique."
427759,20178,369,Joint Hybrid Backhaul and Access Links Design in Cloud-Radio Access Networks,2015,"The cloud-radio access network (CRAN) is expected to be the core network architecture for next generation mobile radio systems. In this paper, we consider the downlink of a CRAN formed of one central processor (the cloud) and several base- station (BS), where each BS is connected to the cloud via either a wireless or capacity-limited wireline backhaul link. The paper addresses the joint design of the hybrid backhaul links (i.e., designing the wireline and wireless backhaul connections from the cloud to the BSs) and the access links (i.e., determining the sparse beamforming solution from the BSs to the users). The paper formulates the hybrid backhaul and access link design problem by minimizing the total network power consumption. The paper solves the problem using a two-stage heuristic algorithm. At one stage, the sparse beamforming solution is found using a weighted mixed $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm minimization approach; the correlation matrix of the quantization noise of the wireline backhaul links is computed using the classical rate- distortion theory. At the second stage, the transmit powers of the wireless backhaul links are found by solving a power minimization problem subject to quality-of-service constraints, based on the principle of conservation of rate by utilizing the rates found in the first stage. Simulation results suggest that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches the global optimum solution, especially at high signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)."
2389857,20178,369,Energy Efficient Evolution of Mobile Networks: Macro-Only Upgrades vs. a Joint-Pico Deployment Strategy,2011,"With the increasing popularity of mobile broadband, mobile network operators (MNOs) are experiencing a continuous boost in network traffic. Some MNOs have stopped offering unlimited data plans, replacing them with a variety of data bundles. At the same time operators are looking at the different options for how to evolve their networks, allowing them to carry the expected increase in traffic. The best solution is generally selected based on two main criteria, performance and cost. However, pushed by a variety of environmental and energy challenges, MNOs are now also showing interest in understanding the impact that different options can have on the energy consumption of their networks. This paper investigates the possible energy gains of evolving a mobile network through a joint pico deployment and macro upgrade solution over a period of 8 years. Besides the network energy consumption, energy efficiency in Mbps/kW is also analyzed. Furthermore, a cost analysis is carried out, to give a more complete picture of the different options being considered. Focusing on the last year of the evolution analysis, results show that deploying more pico sites reduces the energy consumption of the network, by a maximum of 30%. With regards to the energy efficiency, high deployment of pico sites allowed the network to carry 16% more traffic for the same amount of energy. This, however, results in an increase in cost, specifically operational costs."
1317324,20178,369,Computationally Efficient PAPR Reduction Schemes in OFDM-Based Satellite Communication Systems,2012,"Due to the nonlinear characteristics of the high power amplifier (HPA), the employment of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based modulation schemes results in significant amplitude and phase signal distortion due to the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) nature of the OFDM. To overcome this problem, PAPR reduction methods are commonly applied at the transmitter. Among the plenitude of methods available, partial transmit sequences (PTS) and selected mapping (SLM) are the most powerful schemes. The computational complexity for these schemes is considered as the main disadvantage. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity scheme based on iterative PTS (IPTS) that employs two inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFT) and two circulant transform matrices. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme using a partition vector for IPTS with an odd number of ones can achieve both a reduction in PAPR of approximately 2 dB and an improvement of 1.4 dB in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of 10^-4. A further simplification can be achieved by omitting one of the circulant transform matrices in order to improve the computational complexity reduction ratio (CCRR) by 30% and reduce the number of side information bits by 1-bit compared with the IPTS, however, at the cost of a small reduction in PAPR and BER performance."
2136209,20178,369,Comparative forward link traffic channel performance evaluation of HDR and 1XTREME systems,2002,"This paper presents a comparison of the forward link performance of the HDR and 1XTREME systems. Both systems have been proposed as possible evolutionary paths for the 1.25 MHz cdma2000 system, and have been designed to enable high data rate packet transmission. Link-level performance is evaluated by chip-level time-domain simulation of the forward data traffic channel in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, and is then used in a system-level simulator modeling a network of 19 three-sector cells. The system-level simulator accounts for slow and fast fading and two types of multipath channel profiles, as described by the pedestrian A and vehicular B ITU-R channel models. The packet scheduling is performed using a proportionally fair (PF) scheduler. The systems use bit rate adaptation and hybrid ARQ to achieve 1% packet error rate (PER). All users in the system are assumed to always have data packets available for transmission. System performance is evaluated for an embedded sector in terms of average sector throughput as a function of the number of users, distributions of data rates, and individual throughputs over a set of users. Results show the benefits of multiuser diversity exploited by the PF scheduler, and present throughput and fairness comparisons for the two systems."
814683,20178,369,Enhanced SIC and Initial Guess ML Receivers for Collaborative MIMO of the LTE Uplink,2011,"In this paper, Collaborative MIMO is introduced to the Uplink of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. This technique uses two or more single carrier frequency division multiple access based user equipments (UEs) equipped with single antenna. These UEs transmit their data collaboratively over the same Resource block (RB), and then the Evolved Node B (eNodeB) separates the users' data by means of multiuser frequency domain equalization. This will increase the whole throughput of the LTE Uplink, besides moving the complexity of implementing multiple antennas to the eNodeB. In order to decode the data ZF, MMSE and successive interference cancellation (SIC) are employed although they didn't exploit the full spatial diversity, whereas the standard ML is abandoned for its exponential complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel Initial Guess based ML (IGML) receiver whose complexity is in the same order of ML receiver of OFDM-MIMO systems, and a QR based simplified ML receiver. We also propose two ordering techniques for the SIC receiver when used in shadowing environment, as well as various simulation parameters are examined to find the best collaborating environments. The simulation results reveal that the IGML receiver is far by almost 4.5dB at target BER of 10-4 from the traditional MMSE receiver."

Consequently a new over-the-air (OTA) test methodology need to be created to make proper assessment of LTE devices radiated performance. The antenna specific parameters i.e. total antenna efficiency, gain imbalance and correlation coefficient, are essential for a proper MIMO antenna system design. However it can't be use directly to assess the LTE device system performance, since a multiplicity of other factors are involved, e.g. power amplifier load- pull, low noise amplifier source-pull, self interference noise, baseband algorithm and other factors. Several standard organizations are working towards a consensus over the proper OTA MIMO test method, however so far results of measurement campaigns have ambiguous results not allowing a desirable progress [1]. Initially presented at one of several MIMO OTA standard meetings [2], the reference antenna was conceived considering the special case of uniform distribution of incoming power. This paper shows an antenna system that will aid standard organizations and research labs adopting anechoic or reverberation chambers to proper investigate OTA radiated performance, ruling out the LTE devices unknown MIMO 2x2 antenna performance."
3011398,20178,369,Energy-Aware Design for MIMO-OFDM Network with Realistic Interference Model,2016,"Network densification is a promising technology to increase 5G system capacity, including large scale multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) and ultra-dense network. Energy saving and resource utility are the key issues for the densified OFDM system. However, most of previous studies do not taking account of the effect of resource utility in the SINR model, e.g. the load factor. In this paper, we firstly formulate the SINR using more realistic model considering load factor in OFDM systems. Based on this model the energy saving problem is formulated as a joint optimization of beamforming and power subject to users' QoS and load constraint of each cell. To sovle this problem, we propose a two-stage scheme to decouple this problem into the beamforming and power control. In the beamforming stage, we resort to a suboptimal beamformer using the idea of best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE); For the power control stage, we try to minimize the transmit sum-power while fulfilling the user's QoS and load constraints based on theory of standard interference mapping. The convergence behavior of the proposed scheme is rigorously proved. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme converges faster in multiple-antenna cases comparing with the single-antenna counterpart. Moreover the proposed beamformer owns advantage against the traditional ones in term of power saving."

The rapid technological advances have made it possible to implement (cost-effective, short-range) impulse radar and impulse-radio communication and localization systems. Array beamforming and space-time processing techniques promise further advancement in the operational capabilities of impulse radar and impulse-radio communications to achieve long-range coverage, high capacity and interference-free quality of reception. We introduce a realistic signal model for UWB impulse waveforms and develop the principles of space-time array processing based on the signal model. A space-time resolution function (STRF), a space-frequency distribution function (SFDF) and a monopulse-tracking signal are derived for impulse waveforms received by a self-steering array beamforming system. The directivity peak-power pattern and energy pattern of the beamformer are also derived. Computer plots of the STRF, SFDF and the beam patterns are obtained. The directivity beam patterns of impulse waveforms are sidelobe-free and, therefore, there is no need for sidelobe suppression via amplitude weighting of the array elements. Also, the resolution angle for the beam patterns is derived as a decreasing function of array size and frequency bandwidth. Electronic beamsteering based on slope processing of monopulse waveforms is described."
2533758,20178,10228,A mixed quality of service based linear transceiver design for a multiuser MIMO network with linear transmit covariance constraints,2013,"We solve a mixed quality of services (QoS) requirement problem for a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) network with multiple linear transmit covariance constraints. Specifically, we design linear transceivers to satisfy the data rate requirements for a set of users while the rates of the remaining users are balanced. In addition, the design will ensure a set of multiple linear transmit covariance constraints are satisfied. The coupled structure of the transmit filters makes the original problem difficult to solve in the broadcast channel (BC). Hence, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve this mixed QoS problem based on stream-wise mean square error (MSE) duality and alternating optimization framework where the optimization problem is switched between the virtual multiple access channel (MAC) and the BC by exploiting stream-wise MSE duality. The proposed iterative algorithm solves the rate balancing problem by modifying the target rates of the users. In each iteration, a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) is solved to obtain the virtual MAC receiver filters by incorporating multiple linear transmit covariance constraints, where the downlink receiver filters are obtained by minimizing each layer MSE. The power allocation in the virtual MAC is determined by solving a geometric programming (GP) where the product of layer MSEs of each user is balanced with total transmit power constraint. Simulation results for an underlay MIMO cognitive radio network demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm."

Hence, non-coherently detected Reed-Solomon (ReS) coded Slow Frequency Hopping (SFH) assisted M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is proposed for cooperative wireless networks, subjected to both partial-band interference and Rayleigh fading. Erasure insertion (EI) assisted ReS decoding based on the joint maximum output-ratio threshold test (MO-RTT) is investigated in order to evaluate the attainable system performance. Compared to the conventional error-correction-only decoder, the EI scheme may achieve a gain of approximately 3 dB at the Eb/N0 of 10^{−4}, when employing the ReS(31,20) code combined with 32-FSK modulation. Additionally, we evaluated the system's performance, when either equal gain combining (EGC) or selection combining (SC) techniques are employed at the destination's receiver. The results demonstrated that in the presence of one and two assisting relays, the EGC scheme achieves gains of 1.5 dB and 1.0 dB at the Eb/N0 of 10^{−6}, respectively, compared to the SC arrangement."
2491574,20178,369,Improved selective repeat ARQ schemes for data communication,1994,"Many of the communication protocols require an error free transmission of data which cannot be guaranteed by using only a forward error correction technique. For packet switched communications, quite a number of ARQ (automatic repeat request) protocols have been designed which are able to cope with stringent memory requirements, but they either lack safety at high block error rates, or they require a large bandwidth due to low throughput. We introduce two simple and effective strategies (called Stutter-XOR or SXOR and XOR selective repeat or XOR-SR strategies) to increase throughput of existing protocols. In contrast to existing hybrid schemes (combinations of ARQ and forward error correction), the SXOR strategy does not only correct bit errors occurring on radio channels, but also handles block losses caused by buffer overflow in gateways, routers and receivers with limited buffer capacity. This is achieved by sending additional blocks, so called XOR blocks, which are created by combining other blocks using the XOR (modulo-2-addition) operation. We developed several variants of this strategy. Two of them are evaluated by means of simulation. For point-to-multipoint communication the new XOR selective repeat strategy can improve the throughput of existing systems remarkably. The idea of the XOR selective repeat strategy is to physically combine several blocks negatively acknowledged by different receivers by XORing them to minimize the number of retransmissions and hence to increase throughput. >"
894747,20178,369,Relay-Assisted Dynamic Load Balancing Scheme in Multi-Cell Cellular Networks,2014,"In the recent cellular network environment, data traffic has increased rapidly by virtue of the development of a wide variety of wireless technology, such that it is hard for mobile service providers to satisfy the QoS (Quality of Service) requirement. In the real-world, users are not evenly distributed throughout cells; the base stations with multiple users have a great deal of difficulty of limited resources. In order to resolve this load imbalance problem, relay stations which can increase the transmission rates of cell boundary users by service area expansion have been an attractive technique in current networks. In addition, since users at the cell edge suffer from low throughput because of the inter-cell interference (ICI), we adopt additional scheme to mitigate this problem. In this paper, we propose an adaptive relay scheme which can improve the performance of the overall network by utilizing relay stations to distribute heavy traffic to adjacent cells. Each user calculates the network utility function with the neighboring relay stations and base stations, and each relay station also calculates the utility with adjacent cells. The central node controls the associations of users and relay stations through the utility information gathered from base stations. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm improves the throughput and utility of the lower 5\% users without loss of the total network throughput."
2510680,20178,369,Optimum Power Allocation for Fading Relay Channels,2007,"Optimum power allocation is a key technique to realize the full potentials of relay-assisted transmission promised by the recent information-theoretic results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for power allocation problem in a single-relay scenario taking into account the effect of relay location. In particular, we aim to answer the two fundamental questions: Q1) How should the overall transmit power be shared between broadcasting and relaying phases?; Q2) In the relaying phase, how much power should be allocated to relay-to-destination and source-to-destination links? The power allocation problem is formulated to minimize a union bound on the bit error rate (BER) performance assuming amplify-and-forward (AaF) relaying. We consider three TDMA-based cooperation protocols which correspond to distributed implementations of MIMO (multi-input-multi-output), SIMO (single-input-multi-output), and MISO (multi-input-single-output) schemes. Optimized protocols demonstrate significant performance gains over their original versions which assume equal sharing of overall transmit power between the source and relay terminals as well as between broadcasting and relaying phases. It is observed that optimized virtual (distributed) antenna configurations are able to demonstrate a BER performance as close as 0.4 dB within their counterpart co-located antenna configurations."
1186678,20178,21066,Effect of shadowing on outage probability in fluid cellular radio networks,2008,"We propose an adaptive model for the study of cellular networks called the fluid model, useful to each specific network environment characterized by the radio propagation (distance path-loss and shadowing) and by the network configuration. The key idea of the fluid model is to consider the discrete base stations (BS) entities as a continuum of transmitters which are spatially distributed in the network. This allows us to obtain simple analytical expressions of the main characteristics of the network. We focus on the downlink other-cell interference factor, f, which is defined here as the ratio of outer cell received power to the inner cell received power. Taking into account the shadowing, f is expressed as a lognormal random variable. Closed-form formulas of the interference factor's mean m f  and standard deviation sigma f  are provided in this paper. From f, we are able to derive the global outage probability and the spatial outage probability, which depends on the location of a mobile station (MS) initiating a new call. Comparisons to Monte Carlo simulations are proposed, performed in a traditional hexagonal network. Although this factor has been firstly defined for CDMA networks, the analysis presented hereafter is still valid for other systems using frequency reuse 1, like OFDMA (WiMAX), TDMA (GSM with frequency hopping), or even ad hoc networks."
2468197,20178,369,Solution of the multiuser downlink beamforming problem with individual SINR constraints,2004,"We address the problem of joint downlink beamforming in a power-controlled network, where independent data streams are to be transmitted from a multiantenna base station to several decentralized single-antenna terminals. The total transmit power is limited and channel information (possibly statistical) is available at the transmitter. The design goal: jointly adjust the beamformers and transmission powers according to individual SINR requirements. In this context, there are two closely related optimization problems. P1: maximize the jointly achievable SINR margin under a total power constraint. P2: minimize the total transmission power while satisfying a set of SINR constraints. In this paper, both problems are solved within a unified analytical framework. Problem P1 is solved by minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of an extended crosstalk matrix. The solution provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of the SINR requirements. Problem P2 is a variation of problem P1. An important step in our analysis is to show that the global optimum of the downlink beamforming problem is equivalently obtained from solving a dual uplink problem, which has an easier-to-handle analytical structure. Then, we make use of the special structure of the extended crosstalk matrix to develop a rapidly converging iterative algorithm. The optimality and global convergence of the algorithm is proven and stopping criteria are given."
2253042,20178,8839,ARC: an integrated admission and rate control framework for CDMA data networks based on non-cooperative games,2003,"The competition among wireless data service providers brings in an option for the customers to switch their providers, due to unsatisfactory service or otherwise. However, the existing resource management algorithms for wireless networks fail to fully capture the far-reaching impact of this  competitiveness . From this perspective, we propose an integrated  admission and rate control  (ARC) framework for CDMA based wireless data networks. The admission control is at the  session  (macro) level while the rate control is at the link layer  packet  (micro) level. The ARC framework is based on a novel game theoretic formulation which defines non-cooperative games between the service providers and the customers. A user's decision to leave or join a provider is based on a finite set of strategies. A service provider can also construct its game strategy set so as to maximize the utility (revenue) yet attaining its target  churn rate  (the probability of users leaving the network). We show that the pure strategy  Nash equilibrium  can be established for both under-loaded and fully-loaded systems such that the providers have clearly defined admission criteria as outcome from this game. Users are categorized into multiple classes and offered  differentiated services  based on the price they pay and the service degradation they can tolerate. We show that the proposed ARC framework significantly increases the provider's revenue and also successfully offers differentiated QoS to the users."
1854462,20178,369,Investigation into the sensitivity of the power predictions of a microcellular ray tracing propagation model,2000,"This paper investigates the sensitivity of the three-dimensional (3-D) ray tracing microcellular model presented in Astanasiadou et al. (1995, 2000). The variation of the received power is examined for different ray permutations, wall characteristics, antenna position offsets and database inaccuracies. Predictions of the different configurations in line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), and deep shadow areas are compared with each other and also with narrowband measurements. The analysis illustrates that although the model produces reliable results with five orders of reflection and one order of diffraction, higher orders of reflection and double diffracted rays enhance the model's performance in deep shadow areas. It is also shown that good agreement with measured results can be obtained for wall conductivity in the order of 10/sup -3/ S/m and values of relative permittivity around five. The sensitivity analysis to the antenna positioning and database inaccuracies indicates that the receiver positions which suffer the highest power deviations are those at the boundaries of the LOS areas, as well as the positions in the deep shadow regions. In general, for antenna offsets up to 1 m, the predictions of the model are not significantly affected. Finally, the building databases with 1m maximum displacement do not have severe effects on the predictions, but databases with less accuracy can seriously degrade the performance of the model."
313654,20178,369,Localized Mobility Management for SDN-Integrated LTE Backhaul Networks,2015,"Small cell (SCell) and Software Define Network (SDN) are two key enablers to meet the evolutional requirements of future telecommunication networks, but still on the initial study stage with lots of challenges faced. In this paper, the problem of mobility management in SDN-integrated LTE (Long Term Evolution) mobile backhaul network is investigated. An 802.1ad double tagging scheme is designed for traffic forwarding between Serving Gateway (S-GW) and SCell with QoS (Quality of Service) differentiation support. In addition, a dynamic localized forwarding scheme is proposed for packet delivery of the ongoing traffic session to facilitate the mobility of UE within a dense SCell network. With this proposal, the data packets of an ongoing session can be forwarded from the source SCell to the target SCell instead of switching the whole forwarding path, which can drastically save the path-switch signalling cost in this SDN network. Numerical results show that compared with traditional path switch policy, more than 50% signalling cost can be reduced, even considering the impact on the forwarding path deletion when session ceases. The performance of data delivery is also analysed, which demonstrates the introduced extra delivery cost is acceptable and even negligible in case of short forwarding chain or large backhaul latency."
2659600,20178,369,Performance Analysis of Distributed Multi-Cell Coordinated Scheduler,2015,"Multi-Cell coordination or Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) schemes are seen as the next evolution of LTE-Advanced to yield a further improvement in overall system performance. In this paper, we study in detail the performance of one such CoMP scheme, namely Multi-cell coordinated scheduling (MuCCS). In our previous work, we have shown that the performance of MuCCS using a distributed liquid cooperation cluster, where each cell coordinates with its nearest neighbors, out-performs a centralized scheme where the coordination is done over a small set of non-overlapping cells (either three cell or nine cells). In this work, we answer the question of whether there are any additional gains to be obtained by a centralized implementation, if the cooperation cluster is allowed to be arbitrarily large. We also quantify the additional performance gain obtained from allowing intermediate transmit power values besides just the binary on/off power values. Finally, we evaluate the performance of MuCCS when the eNodeBs are connected by a non-ideal backhaul, and devise a distributed MuCCS scheme that retains its advantage over a centralized coordination scheme even in the presence of a non-ideal backhaul. Overall, our results validate that additional high-complexity extensions of coordinated scheduling does not yield large gains over the distributed MuCCS scheme with liquid cooperation clusters and on/off power values. In this paper, we use the geometric mean of UE throughputs as the performance metric, and we motivate the rationale behind use of this as a single metric for performance comparison."
2845738,20178,369,Beamforming in Coexisting Wireless Systems with Uncertain Channel State Information,2016,"This paper considers an underlay access strategy for coexisting wireless networks where the secondary system utilizes the primary spectrum to serve its users. We focus on the practical cases where there is uncertainty in the estimation of channel state information (CSI). Here the throughput performance of each system is limited by the interference imposed by the other, resulting in conflicting objectives. We first analyze the fundamental tradeoff between the tolerance interference level at the primary system and the total achievable throughput of the secondary users. We then introduce a beamforming design problem as a multiobjective optimization to minimize the interference imposed on each of the primary users while maximizing the intended signal received at every secondary user, taking into account the CSI uncertainty. We then map the proposed optimization problem to a robust counterpart under the maximum CSI estimation error. The robust counterpart is then transformed into a standard convex semi-definite programming. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme against various levels of CSI estimation error. We further show that in the proposed approach, the trade-off in the two systems modelled by Pareto frontier can be engineered by adjusting system parameters. For instance, the simulations show that at the primary system interference thresholds of -10 dBm (-5 dBm) by increasing number of antennas from 4 to 12, the secondary system throughput is increased by 3.3 bits/s/channel-use (5.3 bits/s/channel-use)."
2418761,20178,369,Maximum likelihood sequence detection using a pilot tone,2000,"This paper derives, analyzes, and simulates a maximum likelihood (ML) sequence detector (MLSD) for a linearly modulated signal transmitted with a pilot tone (PT-MLSD). The transmitted signal is distorted by a time-varying frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel and corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. The received signal is unsynchronized in that there are residual carrier frequency, carrier phase, and symbol timing offsets. The PT-MLSD treats the channel as a stochastic process, and so symbol sequences are distinguished by their autocovariances. Coherent communication is possible even in overspread channels. As the sequences' autocovariances explicitly account for the channel's time variation, the PT-MLSD's bit error rate (BER) floor is normally lower than the BER floor suffered by receivers that estimate the channel impulse response conventionally. Both the data-bearing signal and pilot tone are used together for synchronization, equalization, and detection. The pilot tone is only needed to remove the constellation's phase ambiguity and provide a stable amplitude reference for QAM constellations. It is not needed for estimating the channel impulse response. The pilot tone does not require a spectral null for its insertion, and it does not significantly degrade the peak-to-average or maximum-to-minimum power ratios. Thus, many of the disadvantages of other pilot tone systems are avoided, as there is no bandwidth expansion, and linear amplification is not made appreciably more difficult."
1312199,20178,369,Compression of Channel State Information for Wireless OFDM Transceivers,2010,"In this paper, we present a channel state information (CSI) feedback reduction algorithm to be used in an adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Adaptive OFDM transceivers, which offer improved data rates and power efficiency over conventional OFDM systems, require a duplex connection between the transmitter and receiver such that the CSI necessary for the transmitter to recalculate the optimal bit and power distributions can be fed back. When a large number of subcarriers are employed, the amount of CSI to be transmitted in the reverse link can consume a prohibitively large amount of bandwidth. In order for adaptive OFDM systems to be implemented in practice, this feedback data has to be reduced. Existing methods of reducing CSI feedback entail compressing the bit and power distributions separately, resulting in the transmission of redundant information due to the correlation between the two distributions. The proposed algorithm removes this redundancy and improves upon an existing feedback compression algorithm that both reduces the number of feedback transmissions necessary to maintain some desired bit error rate (BER) and compresses the CSI by feeding back subchannel gains rather than the bit and power distributions themselves. After applying the proposed algorithm to an adaptive OFDM system with parameters characteristic of wireless local area networks (WLANs), the results show that the number of feedback transmissions can be reduced by up to 90% for slowly varying channels and the CSI to be fed back can be compressed by more than a factor of three."
1924015,20178,369,Inter Base Station Resource Sharing and Improving the Overall Efficiency of B3G Systems,2007,"With the progress of technology and the fast growing demand for ubiquitous high-speed wireless services, flexible resource sharing is widely seen to be an important feature for the deployment of beyond 3G systems. Therefore, a migration from fixed allocations to a more flexible spectrum management has to be taken into account. In this context, inter-operator resource sharing in a broadband network is considered in this paper. A packet-based cellular network is developed, emphasizing the shift in the telecommunications industry towards IP-based services. We show that we can improve the overall efficiency of the system by sharing different resources in the network between several operators. Moreover, big and small operators, in addition to customers are altogether satisfied. In this paper, we use the term resource to not only account for spectrum sharing but also towers, base stations and time slots sharing. In our framework, we will use a physical layer cellular model with idealistic resource management, where we quantify the achievable sharing gains. We compare the performances for the non sharing case, the case where the base stations decide to share the resources as a last resort, and also when the mobile stations always connect to the best base station, regardless of the operator. Finally, We analyze these gains in terms of quality of service, number of operators and different service classes."
2432568,20178,369,Digital Predistortion of Power Amplifiers Based on Spline Approximations of the Amplifier Characteristics,2007,"Digital block-based predistortion (PD) is an efficient scheme to linearize power amplifiers (PA). The performance of this method highly depends on the estimation accuracy of the amplifier characteristics. In this paper, the PA characteristics are approximated by piecewise continuous polynomials in the form of splines. The approximation is based on a block of observed data at the input and output of the PA. This approach leads to a linear parametric approximation problem with moderate implementation complexity, and it also gives the best possible fit to a given set of observations. With cubic splines it is possible to get a fairly accurate estimate even with a short block of data, and hence a fast convergence of the PD algorithm. The performance of the method has been evaluated for an example selected from an application in mobile satellite communications with burst transmission. We use a model of a 2 Watts class A PA that is based on measurements, and the calculations are performed for 16-QAM modulation. The mean square approximation error, the power spectrum and the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the received signal have been analyzed by simulations. For 6 dB back-off, the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) level is reduced by approximately 15 dB relative to a transmitter without predistortion, after an adaptation based on only 25 transmitted symbols."
2297136,20178,369,Phase Noise Suppression in OFDM with Spatial Multiplexing,2007,"A very promising way to achieve high spectral efficiency in wireless communication is the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas. However, in combination with multicarrier modulation, e.g. MIMO-OFDM, the performance of such a system can be drastically limited due to the existence of RF imperfections such as oscillator phase noise. Many methods for phase noise compensations in a single antenna environment have been developed, whereas only a few deal with the problem in a MIMO case. Those contributions mainly discuss the common phase error (CPE) correction. In this work we extend the CPE correction and perform a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation of higher order phase noise harmonics in order to compensate intercarrier interference (ICI) in a multi antenna system. In a coded multi antenna environment it is common to perform detector-decoder iterations which lead to an improved performance behavior. During the iterations we use the a-priori knowledge provided by the decoder to improve the phase noise estimation. This is done by using only the most reliable symbols for performing the LMMSE estimate. As for the detection we use a simple MMSE equalizer where we use the general expression and adapt the noise covariance matrix according to the remaining ICI. Finally the performance is shown by simulation results for an IEEE 802.11n E channel."
2236843,20178,369,Rate-adaptive transmission of H.263 video for multicode DS/CDMA cellular systems in multipath fading,2002,"The variable bit rate nature of compressed video remains a challenge to the transmission of real-time video over mobile CDMA cellular networks. Indeed, H.263 and MPEG-4 video bitstreams are characterized. by high peak rates and frequent rate variations, which are difficult to support in 2.5G and 3G mobile networks. In this paper, we propose a simple scheme which minimizes the peak transmission rate and its variance, which leads to a lower average bit-error rate (BER) and thus a higher received video quality. By introducing a small delay in the decoding process, the video output stream can be buffered at the video decoder end. We propose an algorithm which uses this buffering capability to perform real-time smoothing of the video stream. The transmitter then varies the number of codes assigned to the stream in order to support the remaining smaller rate variations. We simulate an end-to-end video communication system for the IS-95B uplink. It consists of an H.263 codec, an H.223 multiplexer and the physical layer components of the IS-95B standard. The transmitted signal is subject to multipath fading and multiple-access interference, obtained by simulating all the other users in the cell. Our joint smoothing/rate adaptation algorithm leads to a significant gain in the video quality scheme, as compared to previous approaches."
1687778,20178,369,Dynamic Nomadic Node Selection for Performance Enhancement in Composite Fading/Shadowing Environments,2014,"Next generation mobile and wireless communication systems beyond 2020, aka Fifth Generation (5G) systems, aim at providing ubiquitous user experience with the utmost in quality. One of the promising technologies targeted for 5G systems is the flexible network deployment based on nomadic nodes (NNs). An NN is a low-power movable access node that provides coverage extension and capacity improvement on demand. Yet, NNs require flexible backhaul. One possible cost-efficient realization for flexible backhaul is in-band relaying. In this context, the capacity of the wireless backhaul link between an NN and its serving base station (BS) has a crucial role in the achievable end-to-end performance. The flexible backhaul can be exploited by dynamic NN selection to overcome the limitations of the backhaul link and, thus, to enhance the system performance. To this end, dynamic NN selection is carried out via selecting the serving NN from a set of available candidates considering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) on the backhaul link. In this regard, coarse NN selection takes into account only shadowing. Nevertheless, as NNs are stationary or slowly moving during operation, the wireless channels pertaining to NNs are usually subject to simultaneous impairments by both shadowing and multi-path fading, i.e., composite fading/shadowing. In this paper, we present the performance of coarse NN selection in composite fading/shadowing environments with co-channel interference. Further, we evaluate the performance in terms of backhaul link SINR, link rates, and end-to-end rate. Results show that coarse NN selection can yield high performance improvements."
797278,20178,369,A Pre-Equalized Transmission Based on Basefield Hartley Transform over Multi-Path Fading Channels,2011,"This paper proposes a pre-equalized transmission scheme based on a finite field transform. Unlike orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) which transmits signals on orthogonal sub- carriers at the transmitter and explores post-equalization to migrate the effect of multi-path fading at the receiver, in the proposed scheme, signals are processed with the finite field transform called basefield Hartley transform (BHT) before transmission. Since BHT has similar convolution property as discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the inter-symbol interference (ISI) can be mitigated by applying a finite field pre-equalizer and quantization pre-equalizer at the transmitter. By allowing the padded redundancy to take values in finite field, the proposed scheme has the inherent error correction capability with various coding rate. Since the received signals are equivalent to certain block error correction codes, only a decoding scheme is required to recover the source data without any DFT operations that are used in conventional OFDM receiver, which leads to a simple receiving structure with low process complexity. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and provides better bit error rate (BER) performance at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in comparison with the coded OFDM system."
2875513,20178,369,Investigation on Link Adaptation for LTE-Based Machine Type Communication,2016,"Coverage enhancement and low complexity are quite important aspects to support and broaden the application of machine type communication (MTC) in long term evolution (LTE). Repeating the same data across multiple subframes is widely considered as basic solution to improve the coverage. Low complexity target is mainly achieved by reducing the supported bandwidth and restricting the data processing size. Repetitions can be regarded as a new dimension of link adaptation besides the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection and the low complexity features are new factors impacting the link adaption as well. However, existing link adaptation mechanism in LTE system is unable to support such two-dimension link adaptation. Straightforward method suffers serious spectral efficiency loss and more power consumption and there is little other research on this issue, either. To save power and improve the spectral efficiency when performing the link adaptation for MTC, a smart method of coordinating the MCS selection and the repetition level determination with the consideration of new low complexity features is proposed in this paper. Extensive link level simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed method. Simulation results show that proposed method could improve the spectral efficiency by around 42.1% and reduce the power consumption by around 36.8%"

The receiver structure, first proposed by Proakis (1989) and then developed by Ralf Mehlan and Heinrich Meyr (1992) for use on HF fading channels, comprises decision feedback equalizer (DFE), block deinterleaver and TCM decoder in one unit. Antenna diversity is considered leading to a joint diversity and combined equalization/decoding scheme. Furthermore, cyclic slow frequency hopping is used to attain intrinsic frequency diversity to perform a near ideal channel interleaving with a short processing delay. In order to asses the performance of this scheme Monte-Carlo simulations of the system have been carried out where the dynamic behavior of the mobile radio channel has been simulated by means of a selective equal-energy two-ray Rayleigh model, with a variable delay, /spl tau/, between the two rays. Bit error rate (BER) is obtained as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and with /spl tau/, Doppler spread, number of frequencies in the frequency-hopping pattern, number of DFE coefficients and TDMA frame length as parameters. >"
1344045,20178,369,Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Using Intra-Beam Superposition Coding and SIC in Base Station Cooperative MIMO Cellular Downlink,2014,"This paper extends our previously proposed non- orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to the base station (BS) cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular downlink for future radio access. The proposed NOMA scheme employs intra-beam superposition coding of a multiuser signal at the transmitter and the spatial filtering of inter-beam interference followed by the intra-beam successive interference canceller (SIC) at the user terminal receiver. The intra-beam SIC cancels out the inter-user interference within a beam. This configuration achieves reduced overhead for the downlink reference signaling for channel estimation at the user terminal in the case of non-orthogonal user multiplexing and also achieves the applicability of the SIC receiver in MIMO downlink. The transmitter beamforming (precoding) matrix is controlled based on open loop-type random beamforming using a block- diagonalized beamforming matrix, which is very efficient in terms of the amount of feedback information from the user terminal. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA scheme with block-diagonalized random beamforming in BS cooperative multiuser MIMO and the intra-beam SIC achieves better system-level throughput compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is assumed in LTE-Advanced. We also show that BS cooperative operation along with the proposed NOMA in particular achieves a high cell-edge user throughput gain which implies better user fairness and universal connectivity."

LA Metro performed a program to set consistent and meaningful standards for train emissions and train control equipment immunity for existing trains, signal equipment, and future rolling stock and train control systems. The project team surveyed and analyzed existing LA Metro LRV signal systems to determine the electromagnetic interference (EMI) susceptibility to LRV conducted and inductive emissions for each line. The measured susceptibility curves are the quantified basis for conducted and inductive emission limits which provide adequate protection for signal equipment from LRV emissions on existing and future lines. Inadequate protection results in intermittent or sustained signal disruptions causing delay or hazards. Excessive protection adds weight and cost to the LRVs and provides no benefit to LA Metro and its passengers."
3248219,20178,369,Control of Performance in Mobile Networks in the Presence of User Impatience,2016,"We study in this work user impatience by adopting a realistic realization: a user gets impatient when its throughput falls below a certain threshold for a given patience duration. We model such a behavior in a cellular network, transporting elastic flows, for a realistic user configuration with random arrivals, following a Poisson process, and departure after a finite duration, either upon transfer completion or because of impatience. We derive several performance metrics, pertaining to the probability of abandoning the transfer as well as transport efficiency in terms of traffic efficiently transported until service completion versus wasted resources because of abandonment. We further implement a control mechanism using two approaches: a preventive one, based on blocking of users when their number exceeds a certain threshold, and a reactive one, based on dropping of users when the network experiences congestion, and show how the system performance gets enhanced in both cases."
3106775,20178,369,Fast Loop-Free Transition of Routing Protocols,2016,"In networks that operate during a long time, the routing protocol might have to be changed (in order to apply a routing protocol update, or to take into account a change in the routing metrics). A loop-free transition algorithm has to be used in order to perform the transition to the new routing protocol without generating transient routing loops. In this paper, we propose a loop-free transition algorithm called ACH (avoiding cycles heuristic), which is able to perform the transition in a very small number of steps. Compared to other algorithms of the literature, ACH yields a number of steps which is independent of both the number of nodes and the number of destinations, and thus allows the transition to be performed in a small time. We show through simulations that ACH significantly outperforms other heuristics of the literature, due to its capability to deal with several destinations at once, and due to a priority-based procedure to avoid cycles."

We can find in the literature some advances in algorithms and techniques to handle this issue, but there is still room for innovative solutions. For example, new approaches considering different sources of information about city dynamics and urban social behavior. In fact, one of the goals of this paper is to show the benefits of using this type of data to improve short-term traffic prediction. This paper propose STRIP, a novel short-term traffic prediction model that combines logistic regressions with two urban data sources: historical data of traffic flow obtained from online maps, such as Bing Maps, and users' check-ins, shared on participatory sensor networks, which capture the routines of city inhabitants (here known as social sensors). Simulation results show that STRIP improves the accuracy of state of the art studies, specially when using data from social sensors as input."
3038676,20178,369,Integrating Vehicular Data into Smart Home IoT Systems Using Eclipse Vorto,2016,"The emerging trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables new applications and aims to interconnect and integrate existing domains such as smart home or automotive. While enabling new applications, this also creates new challenges. Many of these challenges have their roots in interoperability issues between different interfaces within these domains and between one another. In this paper an approach to deal with these issues is presented. It makes use of the device description framework Eclipse Vorto. Using Vorto's capabilities to generally describe devices and interfaces and generating code, a proof of concept has been implemented where a smart home platform is connected to an electric vehicle in order to integrate the vehicle as part of a smart home platform. The paper discusses the challenges, introduces the proposed concept and gives some details on the implementation of the exemplary use case."
3011246,20178,369,Path Loss Model Based on Cluster at 28GHz in the Office and Corridor Environments,2016,"This paper presents 28GHz path loss model based on cluster obtained from channel measurement campaigns with rotating platforms and directional antennas in the office and corridor environments. As the sequence number of cluster increases, the path loss exponents (PLEs) increase while shadow factors also have the growing tendency. The PLE of all-clusters is the least because of multi propagation paths, and the LOS PLEs of corridor scenario are less compared with that of office scenario because of corridor's long and narrow structure. This path loss model not only contains cluster characteristics, but also unites directional and omnidirectional model into the same framework, which to some extent improves the 5G mmWave channel model."
3023792,20178,369,Distribution-Based Energy Efficiency Analysis of Intelligent Content Service Network,2016,"Wireless communication network is always resource limited, which is hard to satisfy the rapidly growing QoS requirements of users, such as high data rate and low energy consumption. The simple and straightforward solution is to alleviate the network resources and energy consumption. This paper proposes Intelligent Content Service Network (ICSN) to satisfy users' requirements based on the concept of spatialtemporal decoupling. The main idea of ICSN is to make contents predictions by analyzing users' accessing history, then choose the right time and location to accomplish content transmission according to the predicting results. Experiments are conducted under two typical and ubiquitous scenarios, which are Tsinghua XuetangX and THU Online Learning Platform, in order to illustrate the energy efficiency of ICSN, here represented by the network traffic flow reduction rate. After analyzing the users' behaviour, we put forward predicting methods according to their respective characteristics, and results show that the network traffic is reduced by 23% and 68% under these two scenarios respectively. Moreover, for ideal condition that both of time and location can be predicted precisely, the reduction rate reaches 98%. The results show that ICSN can greatly improve the energy efficiency, which depends on the prediction precision of content transmission time and location."
3041162,20178,369,Time-Interleaved Block-Windowed Burst OFDM,2016,"The growing progress in wireless communication services lead to a demand in high data rates, spectral efficiency and flexibility requirements. The recently proposed Block- Windowed Burst Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (BWB-OFDM) transceiver proved to be a reliable alternative scheme to face these current demands. BWB-OFDM employs smoother, non- rectangular windows, allowing a power spectral density similar to the filtered OFDM approach; also, it packs together several OFDM symbols, with the addition of a sole zero- padding to accommodate the multipath channel's propagation delay. This means better overall power and spectral efficiencies. Nevertheless, the system has the same drawback of OFDM when transmitting over hostile channel conditions, such as deep fading in time-dispersive channels. To overcome this problem, a new Time-Interleaved BWB- OFDM (TIBWB- OFDM) transceiver is proposed. This scheme employs interleaving on the time-samples of each BWB- OFDM block, thus creating a sort of diversity at the frequency domain, aiming to preserve the data symbols severely corrupted by the channel's deep fades. The new TIBWB-OFDM transceiver presents considerable power gains relatively to the BWB-OFDM,while maintaining their spectral efficiency."
2895176,20178,369,Optimal Repair for Distributed Storage Codes in Vehicular Networks,2016,"Erasure codes are introduced to reduce file downloaded latency for content distribution in vehicle networks. Since node failure happens frequently, naive repair will lead to network traffic (bandwidth) congestion. In this work, we employ a mutual information based approach to improve the minimal repair bandwidth by considering the relative generalized Hamming weight. Compared with naive repair, this approach improves about 30% repair bandwidth. Although the approach is in the form of recovering one single node, it can be extended to any failed nodes. Finally, simulations are conducted to support our results."
3040830,20178,369,Characterization of Intersection Topologies in Urban Areas for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication,2016,"The vehicle-to-vehicle communication through exchange of information between vehicles and their neighborhood provides great opportunity to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. Consequently, safety-based V2V applications have to fulfill quality requirements in order to help drivers in critical situations on rural and motorway roads, as well as in urban and inner-city areas. However, due to the inevitable presence of stationary radio shadowing, especially in inner-city intersections, a significant contingent of message transmissions will be susceptible to recurrent signal attenuation caused by building obstructions. In this paper, we characterize the intersection topologies in urban areas by analyzing the presence and placement of buildings around intersections from a data set covering more than twenty five big cities selected worldwide. For the evaluation, we consider real data gathered from a free available online map that provides geographical data and street networks. Moreover, a simple approach allowing a meticulous characterization, and dealing with the high computational time and memory constraints is introduced."
3058022,20178,369,Hotspot Identification through Call Trace Analysis,2016,"Network-collected call trace data has the potential to provide relevant information that can be leveraged to enhance the accuracy of network planning and optimization algorithms.In this paper, we present a geolocation technique that relies on prediction-based RF Pattern Matching (RFPM) and its application in the generation of high-accuracy traffic hotspot maps. The method relies solely on call trace data and an uptodate configuration of the cellular network. We demonstrate the value of this algorithm over existing solutions and validate the approach with LTE measurements collected in a very dense urban environment (Tokyo center). Unlike existing techniques, the proposed solution is capable of identifying traffic hotspots at the level of individual buildings and the resulting map is consistent with building heights."
3048260,20178,369,User Matching with Relation to the Stable Marriage Problem in Cognitive Radio Networks,2016,"We consider a network comprised of multiple primary users (PUs) and multiple secondary users (SUs), where the SUs seek access to a set of orthogonal channels each occupied by one PU. Only one SU is allowed to coexist with a given PU. We propose a distributed matching algorithm to pair the network users, where a Stackelberg game model is assumed for the interaction between the paired PU and SU. The selected secondary is given access in exchange for monetary compensation to the primary. The PU optimizes the interference price it charges to a given SU and the power allocation to maintain communication. The SU optimizes its power demand so as to maximize its utility. Our algorithm provides a unique stable matching. Numerical results indicate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over other reference schemes."
2867374,20178,369,Modeling the Evolution of Line-of-Sight Blockage for V2V Channels,2016,"We investigate the evolution of line of sight (LOS) blockage over both time and space for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels. Using realistic vehicular mobility and building and foliage locations from maps, we first perform LOS blockage analysis to extract LOS probabilities in real cities and on highways for varying vehicular densities. Next, to model the time evolution of LOS blockage for V2V links, we employ a three- state discrete-time Markov chain comprised of the following states: i) LOS; ii) non-LOS due to static objects (e.g., buildings, trees, etc.); and iii) non-LOS due to mobile objects (vehicles). We obtain state transition probabilities based on the evolution of LOS blockage. Finally, we perform curve fitting and obtain a set of distance- dependent equations for both LOS and transition probabilities. These equations can be used to generate time-evolved V2V channel realizations for representative urban and highway environments. Our results can be used to perform highly efficient and accurate simulations without the need to employ complex geometry-based models for link evolution."
1257620,20178,208,Area-Based Dissemination in Vehicular Networks,2014,Pure opportunistic dissemination of content in a vehicular network can incur high delays if the number of vehicles is relatively low. We consider in this paper an areabased approach to information broadcast in which vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications is supplemented with vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications in order to improve the delay performance. We show how area-based dissemination can analyzed mathematically using a Markovian model. We also investigate through trace-based simulations how different area partitioning approaches affect the total dissemination time.
3047858,20178,369,SPARTAN: A Solution to Prevent Traffic Jam with Real-Time Alert and Re-Routing for Smart City,2016,"As an important component of Smart Cities, transportation system plays a critical role to address the sustainability and mobility of the society. One key concern is that the number of vehicles continuously increases faster than the available infrastructure, as well as the traffic congestion is a difficult issue to deal with. Several solutions to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been proposed to identify congestion and re-route the vehicles afterwards. In this direction, this work introduces SPARTAN, a fully distributed ITS solution, which notifies drivers about congested areas through Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication and employs a real-time decision making mechanism used to reroute vehicles to avoid the congested areas. Simulation results show the effectiveness of SPARTAN in calculating new routes and disseminating them to vehicles that approaching a congestion area. As a consequence, SPARTAN reduces the travel time and the congestion time in urban scenarios when compared to existing approaches."
3020787,20178,369,Gaussian Modeling of Spatially Correlated LOS/NLOS Maps for Mobile Communications,2016,"The wireless channel behaves markedly different depending on whether a line-of-sight (LOS) between transmitter and receiver exists or not. State-of-the-art wireless channel models for mobile communications, such as, IST WINNER-II and the 3GPP 3D channel model specified in TR 36.873, define distinct macro- and microscopic fading parameters for LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) situations. Whether a user is in LOS/NLOS is randomly determined by a distance-dependent LOS probability; commonly, for each position in the network, the random realization of LOS/NLOS propagation is independently determined from this distance-dependent LOS probability. Since in this case random draws of neighboring positions are statistically independent, base station assignment regions in system-level simulations become highly irregular. To mitigate this problem, we propose an efficient method to generate spatially correlated LOS/NLOS channel maps that follow predefined distance-dependent LOS probability and additionally enable spatial clustering of LOS positions."
2895385,20178,369,Resource Allocation and Performance Measures in Multi-User Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks,2016,"In a cognitive radio network (CRN) of multiple secondary users (SUs) and multiple primary user channels, the protocol of allocating channel resources to SUs and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the protocol are still open issues.In this paper, we developed a novel protocol to allocate channels to SUs and an analytical criterion to evaluate the performance of this protocol.The system settings and environmental parameters, including spectrum sensing errors of SUs, adaptive modulation and coding schemes, and finite SU buffer size, are taken into consideration in our framework.By modeling the behavior of each SU as a discrete-time queue, we obtained a performance evaluation function (PEF) considering the rejected packets, collision packets and error packets.Simulation and numerical results showed that the protocol is better than random allocation in terms of PEF. The impact of different system settings on the optimal protocol settings and the optimal PEF was also investigated."
2844037,20178,369,Index Modulated OFDM with ICI Self-Cancellation,2016,"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is prone to frequency offset which gives rise to intercarrier interference (ICI). Recently, a novel OFDM transmission scheme called OFDM with index modulation (IMOFDM) is proposed, which outperforms conventional OFDM in the absence of frequency offset. As in IM-OFDM, partial subcarriers are set to be idle by spatial modulation, the potential of IM-OFDM in ICI reduction is expected. In this paper, we find that this potential vanishes in some real scenarios with ICI, which leads to IM-OFDM exhibiting even worse performance than conventional OFDM. To improve this situation, a novel ICI cancellation scheme is designed, which integrates the ICI self-cancellation technique into the IM-OFDM framework. Via careful designs, the proposed scheme not only provides a solution to ICI problems of IM- OFDM, but also achieves an attractive tradeoff between the spectral efficiency and ICI cancellation performance of the system. Simulations validate that in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO), the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing IM-OFDM and more importantly shows better performance than the conventional OFDM with ICI self-cancellation."
2991121,20178,369,An Energy-Saving Algorithm Based on Base Station Sleeping in Multi-Hop D2D Communication,2016,"Nowadays, with the increasing awareness of environmental and economic issues, energy efficiency has received an enormous amount of attention. In this paper, we investigate an energy-saving algorithm called Greedy Base Station Sleeping (G- BSS), based on clustering for Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in cellular network and derive the energy utility function to evaluate energy consumption of the implementation scenario. In addition, a novel user association scheme is developed for the first time to solve the communication problem of users in sleep cells, in which the D2D clusters in sleep cells associate to the selected inter-CH (Cluster Head) in neighbor cells according to location information and residual energy, namely forming a merger cluster. Extensive simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm reduces efficiently energy consumption and achieves low delay."
3038738,20178,369,Multicarrier Air to Ground MIMO Communication System Performance,2016,"The use of aeronautical vehicles and consequently their communication traffic are growing rapidly, and soon there will be demands for channels with larger bandwidths. The L-band digital aeronautical communication system (L-DACS1) was proposed by EUROCONTROL as an OFDM based multicarrier communication system candidate, with channels inlayed between distance measuring equipment (DME) channels. We previously proposed a similar communication system based on the Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) technique, which has some significant advantages over L-DACS1. In this paper several diversity and multiple antenna techniques for L-DACS1 and FBMC AG communication systems are investigated. The correlation coefficient between realistic receiver aircraft antenna channels is computed, and using these realistic channels-based upon NASA channel measurements-link performance is simulated to generate BER results. Simulation results show the advantages of using multiple antennas at the receiver, and the antenna separations required (as a function of link distance) to attain nearly uncorrelated channels for two suburban areas. MIMO performance gains are quantified and show significant improvement over single-antenna systems, especially for higher order modulations."
3119105,20178,369,Automatic Blind Modulation Recognition of Analog and Digital Signals in Cognitive Radios,2016,"In cognitive radio networks, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a fundamental step to perform the classification of different modulation formats. It plays an important role both in military and civil applications. For a cognitive radio receiver, AMR is the intermediate step between signal detection and demodulation. In this work, we propose a novel blind AMR algorithm to distinguish amongst both digital and analog signals. In particular, we exploit higher order moments as well as some features of the received signals, recognizing not only the modulation formats (amplitude, phase, and frequency) but also the levels of the constellations. We can classify up to 17 different (analog and digital) modulations. The simulation results confirm the validity of our approach for blind modulation recognition in cognitive radio applications."
3198543,20178,369,An Extension of Spatial Channel Model with Spatial Consistency,2016,"Spatial consistency is identified as an important feature for fifth generation (5G) channel model. In this paper, a geometry stochastic approach for spatial consistency is presented under the framework of spatial channel model. The extended stochastic channel model (SCM) realizes large-scale parameters(LSPs) and small- scale parameters (SSPs) in a continuous and realistic manner as a function of position. Channel measurements at 73 GHz are taken in an outdoor scenario, where correlation distances are analyzed, and observation on spatial consistency is found. Simulations of the extended channel model verify that the channel realizations can well present the properties of spatial consistency and match our measurements."
3020674,20178,369,Experimental Verification of Null-Space Expansion for Multiuser Massive MIMO Using Measured Channel State Information,2016,"This paper presents experimental results of our proposed null-space expansion scheme for multiuser massive MIMO in time varying channel.&#12288;Multiuser MIMO transmission with proposed scheme can suppress inter-user interference (IUI) caused by outdated channel state information (CSI).&#12288;The excess degrees of freedom (DoFs) of massive MIMO is exploited to perform additional null-steering using past estimated CSI.&#12288;The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) performance achieved by a null-space expansion scheme that uses measured CSI is experimentally evaluated through CSI measurements.&#12288;It is confirmed that the proposed scheme shows SIR performance superior to the conventional channel prediction scheme.&#12288;In addition, IUI can be stably suppressed even in high mobility environments by further increasing the null-space dimension."
3000765,20178,369,Highly Accurate Distance Estimation Using Spatial Filtering and GNSS in Urban Environments,2016,"In this paper, an algorithm for accurate distance estimation of a vehicle to a road side unit (RSU) in urban multipath environments is presented. The algorithm is based on spatial filtering using a uniform circular array (UCA) antenna and a cross correlation based time delay detection. The time base for the cross correlation is built using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based positioning. Furthermore, an algorithm for non- line-of-sight (NLOS) detection based on a fingerprinting technique is presented to identify shadowing situations. For evaluation purposes, a simulation for a vehicle following a straightway maneuver within an urban orthogonal traffic intersection scenario is carried out. The B1 line- of-sight (LOS) specified in WINNER II is used for multipath channel modeling. Simulation results show that the obtained distance estimation accuracy of a vehicle is better than 50cm within a radius of 500m around the traffic intersection origin and the proposed NLOS detection algorithm exhibits a 0% false alarm probability (FAP) within this range."
3048041,20178,369,Impact of Dynamic Planning on Uplink Service Quality in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks,2016,"In literature, dynamic planning (base station (BS) on-off switching) is proposed as an efficient approach for energy saving at a low call traffic load condition. All related research efforts aim to employ dynamic planning to save energy for the network operators while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) for downlink mobile users. On the other hand, although switching off a BS can save energy for network operators and satisfy the downlink QoS, it may lead to associating uplink mobile users with a faraway BS, and hence, degrade the uplink QoS. Such an impact of dynamic planning on uplink service quality is not well investigated in literature. In this paper, we aim to quantify this impact by considering two QoS metrics, namely, user required throughput and call dropping probability due to mobile terminal battery depletion for uplink data calls. Simulation results demonstrate that BS switching off decisions that do not account for the uplink QoS requirements can result in severe service quality degradation."
3007891,20178,369,Impact of Correlated Group Mobility Modelling in the Context of Realistic Mobile Network Simulation Scenarios,2016,"User mobility in mobile radio networks strongly affects the performance of the whole system. Thus, it is of upmost importance to model mobility patterns as realistically as possible. Several publications w. r. t. individual (realistic) user movements have been made. However, especially in urban scenarios, user mobility is often correlated. In public transportation systems (metro, bus, etc.) the motion of many users is bound to the same vehicle, leading to a far different system performance (e.g. cell load, number of handovers, etc.). Therefore, a new correlated group mobility model is presented in this paper. Results show that the system performance compared to individual user movements is significantly different."
2877148,20178,369,Coexistence of UF-OFDM and CP-OFDM,2016,"Universal Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (UF-OFDM) is considered as a promising 5G waveform candidate. It requires a relatively simple transceiver structure, while achieving much better spectral properties compared to CP-OFDM. During the early deployment of 5G systems, many frequency bands will still be occupied by 4G systems, using the legacy CP-OFDM waveform. The main focus in this work lies on using the uplink shared channel (PUSCH) with both waveforms on the same carrier. We analyze the impact of inter-carrier interference (ICI) leakage on the performance of both receivers for neighboring allocations using the different waveforms. We also propose two techniques to mitigate the effect of ICI between both waveforms, namely: 1-delaying the transmitted UF-OFDM signal relative to the transmitted CPOFDM signal to reduce the ICI on the CP-OFDM receiver and 2- windowing at the UF-OFDM receiver to suppress the power spectral leakage from the CP-OFDM signal."
3047782,20178,369,Weighted Blind Spectrum Sensing Based on Signal Auto-Correlation and Cross-Correlation Characteristics in Rayleigh Fading Channels,2016,"Algorithms based on signal correlation have low computational complexity and require little knowledge on primary signals or noise signals. However, their detection performance becomes relatively terrible in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime with weak signal correlation, which happens to be quite common in practical systems. In this paper, a weighted blind spectrum sensing algorithm based on signal correlation is proposed to effectively improve the detection performance on the basis of above-mentioned advantages of correlation- based detection. This proposed algorithm adequately exploits the auto-correlation (AC) and cross- correlation (CC) characteristics of received signals and assigns a proper weighting coefficient to each term in the test statistic of our algorithm, enlarging the difference of test statistic with or without the existence of primary users (PUs) and thus greatly promoting the detection performance. False alarm and detection probabilities are analyzed thoroughly in the low-SNR regime, and their approximate analytical expressions are derived based on the central limit theorem (CLT). Simulations are presented to verify the analyses. Experiments show that the proposed detection can significantly outperform other correlation-based algorithms."
495889,20178,369,The Final Destination: Building Test Bed Apps for DIL Environments,2015,"Recent years have seen a massive growth in the everyday use of smartphones and tablet (here called smart mobile devices or SMDs) and a turn towards app based software to connect to cloud based services. This has had a huge impact on how people access information and communicate in all spheres of life, with always online now being the default mode for most people. These changes also affect the military, albeit at a slower pace. Moving towards a diversified app-architecture for sharing and processing information has clear operational benefits [1]. However, a key differentiator between civilian and military contexts is the fact that in actual operations the military will, at least on the tactical level, operate on disadvantaged, intermittent and/or limited (DIL) networks. The IST-118 working group is exploring solutions to deal with DIL related issues, and to be able to test these as realistically as possible could be very beneficial. This paper proposes a possible solution, the MLAB App Builder developed at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). MLAB lets nondevelopers create SMD apps for Android, iOS, Windows Phones, etc. simply by using point and click. This means that polished apps can be created easily, and using built-in facilities for monitoring of user interaction will help to test everything from content filtering to offline use. Apps created in MLAB uses an architecture that allow apps to work on and offline when connections are intermittent and allow for transparent connections to external services or local substitutes."
2836234,20178,369,"O White Space, White Space, Whatfore Art Thou White Space?",2016,"A few steps from Shakespeare's spiritual home The Globe Theatre in London, the UK regulator Ofcom is formulating its own well-crafted play based on TV White Spaces (TVWS). We have been leading a major trial under the Ofcom TVWS Pilot in the UK, where it is noted that the same approach to TVWS is employed across Europe through the ETSI EN 301 598 Harmonized European Standard. Our trial has led to numerous observations on white space availability, use cases, and achievable performance in TVWS particularly under aggregation scenarios, among other aspects. This paper expands on some of our prior publications highlighting such outcomes and observations, particularly based on real testing within our trial. It draws fundamental conclusions around scenarios in which TVWS could and should be used. For example, it is observed that TVWS is often most appropriate for below-rooftop receiver or indoor scenarios, and for lower-power (e.g., 20 dBm) deployment scenarios which achieve excellent, and far more consistent, usable channel availability than higher-power alternatives. Further, aggregation in TVWS is heavily covered, attempting to match to various example deployment cases mirroring current and future communication systems. Observations are made on radio design under aggregation, particularly for the European TVWS case."
3119160,20178,369,Real Life LTE In-Building Deployment Demonstrating Multi-Cell Capacity,2016,"In Building Solutions (IBS) are a well-established approach to providing indoor cellular coverage. The increasing wireless mobile broadband traffic and the fact that most broadband data is consumed indoors increases the interest to understand the IBS capacity potential. For a given available spectrum, a straightforward capacity solution is cell-splitting. In this paper, measurement results from a full-scale real life deployment with a Long Term Evolution (LTE) IBS solution are presented. Two cell-splitting scenarios in a three floor, 7500 m2 office building have been tested, both by collecting traffic and radio statistics from actual users, as well as performing controlled walk-tests in the building. It is found that cell splitting is an excellent way to enable increased indoor capacity. The isolation between floors as well as within a floor is higher than in a typical macro scenario. High throughput and fraction of spatial multiplexing is maintained even with artificially generated 100% activity. The capacity is assessed to around 2 kbps/m2/MHz with a 6 cell solution."
2896543,20178,369,A Simple Statistical Signal Loss Model for Deep Underground Garage,2016,"In this paper we address the channel modeling aspects for a deep-indoor scenario with extreme coverage conditions in terms of signal losses, namely underground garage areas. We provide an in- depth analysis with regard to the path loss (gain) and large-scale signal shadow fading, and propose a simple propagation model which can be used to predict cellular signal levels in similar deep- indoor scenarios. The measurement results indicate that the signal at 800 MHz band penetrates external concrete walls to reach the lower levels, while for 2000 MHz wall openings are required for the signal to propagate. It is also evident from the study that the shadow fading at different levels of an underground garage are highly correlated. The proposed frequency-independent floor attenuation factor (FAF) is shown to be in range of 5.2 dB per meter deep. Therefore, the attenuation rate in the z dimension is much higher than the in-building attenuation in x and y dimension, which is often assumed at 0.6 dB/m."

Hence, any mobile device seeking a new service can search and discover for nearby services with the help of the LTE-A network. From an implementation point of view, our solution fits very well within the 3GPP standards as it utilizes its network elements designated for offering proximity based services. Our experimental results proved the efficiency of our system in helping mobile users discover needed services offered by nearby providers."
3058116,20178,369,Cooperative Sensing with Dependent Observations on BPSK Signal: To Quantize Amplitude or Sign,2016,"This paper discusses a typical cooperative sensing model where the local observations are conditionally dependent. The primary user sends a binary phase-shifted keying modulated signal and the hard combining strategy is implemented among second users. Two low-complexity local quantization schemes corresponding to the choice of quantizing either the amplitude or the sign as the one-bit reported message are compared. We show that the optimal fusion rule for quantizing the sign is non-monotone, which is different from the design for quantizing amplitude scheme. Based on large deviation theory, we finish the parameter optimization for both schemes and use the error exponent to evaluate the asymptotical performance. Several closed-form expressions are derived. Numerical results show that to quantize the sign is asymptotically optimal in low-SNR regime, while to quantize the amplitude performs well in high-SNR regime. This work shows that the dependence among local observations may greatly help the final decision in some case, and the non-monotone fusion rule may achieve better performance than the monotone one for dependent observations."
3031108,20178,369,Lane-Level Vehicular Localization Utilizing Smartphones,2016,"Lane-level vehicular localization has been regarded as a critical technology component for future vehicle navigation services. Current lane-level vehicular localization systems require dedicated devices, making the systems difficult to popularize. Moreover, most systems depend heavily on continuous accurate GPS data, which may be interfered under specific environments. Efficient lane-level map building is another problem to deal with. In this paper, we propose an integrated system with the capability of map building and lane- level localization using smartphones. This system employs a crowdsourcing-based approach to collect information from multiple sensors (including GPS, orientation sensor and acceleration sensor), such as lane changes and turns. Based on the information, a lane localization schemes is designed using the tool of machine learning. The experimental results show that the proposed system achieves high accuracy of map building and lane-level localization."
3001973,20178,369,Joint Beamforming and Remote Radio Head Selection in Limited Fronthaul C-RAN,2016,"This paper considers the power minimization problem in downlink of cloud radio access networks with limited fronthaul capacity. A joint design of beamforming, remote radio head (RRH) selection and RRH-user association that explicitly takes into account per- fronthaul capacity constraints is considered. The problem of interest is in fact a combinatorial program which is generally NP- hard. We naturally write the considered problem as a mixed integer program by introducing binary selection variables. The challenge is that even if these binary selection variables are relaxed to be continuous, the resulting problem is still nonconvex. For such a problem, finding a high- quality solution, rather than an optimal one, is a more realistic goal. Towards this end we propose two iterative algorithms to deal with combinatorial nature of the joint design problem. In the first method, by novel transformations, we iteratively approximate the continuous nonconvex constraints by convex conic ones using successive convex approximation framework. More explicitly the problem arrived at each iteration of the first method is a mixed-integer second order cone program (MISOCP) for which dedicated solvers are available. The second method is a simplified variant of the first one where we further relax the binary variables in each iteration to be continuous. That is to say, the second method merely requires solving a sequence of SOCPs. After convergence, we then perform a postprocessing procedure on the relaxed selection variables to search for a high-performance solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over existing methods based on sparse-inducing norm."
3038781,20178,369,Simplified Performance Analysis for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Diversity Optimal Detection of Binary Signals with Symmetric Alpha-Stable Noise,2016,"For a wide range of wireless channels, symmetric alpha- stable (S&#945;2642S) is shown to be applicable to model the noise and/or the interference. However, the ongoing research of the optimal detection of the cooperative diversity in alpha- stable noise is limited to few closed-form expressions for special values of the characteristic exponent &#945;2642 due to the unavailability of the probability density function of the noise. This limits the performance analysis of such networks. In this paper, to overcome this difficulty, we use the compound property of the S2642&#945;S distribution to derive an approximate analytical expression for the error probability. This facilitates the calculation of the error performance of the cooperative amplify-and-forward diversity with optimal detection of binary signals in S2642&#945;S noise for any value of 2642&#945;. Computer simulations are used to verify the correctness and accuracy of the derived analytical error results. Our mathematical modeling and simulations prove that asymptotic maximum diversity order is achievable."

This is critical for vehicle-to-infrastructure networks which are cellular networks designed to support emerging vehicular applications. Motivated by measurement and ray tracing results in urban microcells, instead of characterizing the pathloss by Euclidean distance, we calculate it by the weighted sum of segment length along the propagation path, i.e., Manhattan distance, and a certain corner loss at the intersections along the path. We analyze network performance by modeling the urban microcell network by a Manhattan Poisson line process. Our results show significant differences between Manhattan and Euclidean distance- based pathloss models. Assuming the receiver is associated with the base station (BS) with the smallest pathloss, we derive closed-form expression of the distribution of the associated link pathloss. We obtain the coverage probability and reveal the impacts of interference from the LOS and NLOS BSs. It is shown that in this scenario the interference from a NLOS parallel street is negligible."
3198695,20178,369,A Roadside Unit-Based Localization Scheme to Improve Positioning for Vehicular Networks,2016,"Many Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) applications require that each vehicle knows precisely its current position in real time. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is technology most widely used to determine the positioning of vehicles in VANETs. However, the GPS has several drawbacks, one of them is the lack of accuracy of the measurement of impact is the most unacceptable disadvantage. In this work, we propose a roadside unit- based localization scheme to improve the accuracy level of the vehicles' position for VANETs. In this way, each one of roadside units fix the relative position error and informs all vehicles that are within of the coverage area. The proposed solution requires few roadside units, which represents a low-cost of deployment, and it was able to reduce GPS error in this critical area from 7.21 m to 0.74 m."
3040957,20178,369,Controlled Inter-Carrier Interference for Physical Layer Security in OFDM Systems,2016,"Performance of OFDM is known to be very sensitive to frequency synchronization errors. By exploiting this feature, a novel technique is proposed to provide secure communication against eavesdropping. The technique is based on introducing self inter-carrier interference to pre-compensate the carrier offset only for the legitimate user. This pre-compensation process depends on both the channel and the local carrier offset of the legitimate user, hence provides another degree of freedom for secrecy. Since an eavesdropper experiences an uncorrelated channel, his performance is expected to be degraded. Also our approach converts the simple one-tap frequency domain channel equalization to a very complex receiver operation for the eavesdropper. Moreover, the power aspects of this technique are discussed. By setting a threshold in the pre-compensation stage, we provide an acceptable trade-off between the transmitted power and the error performance."
3040976,20178,369,Arbitrary Constellations with Coded Maximum Ratio Transmission over Downlink Nakagami-m Fading Channels,2016,"There has been a rejuvenated interest in the use of arbitrary constellations (non-equally spaced) after promising performance results were demonstrated compared to conventional grid and circular constellations. To enable the development of such constellations, in this contribution we derive an upper bound bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for coded transmit maximum ratio combining (TMRC) systems operating in Nakagami-\textit{m} fading environments with arbitrary constellations and encoder types. Unlike most existing works on error performance analysis for coded systems, a chosen pair of constellation and encoder need not be quasi-regular. Furthermore, the system model includes a provision for multiple orthogonal transmission phases with different number of transmit antennas. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the derived analytical results for a range of system scenarios."

This network is compared to a similarly dimensioned 3GPP-like deployment, in order to emphasize the correlations and the differences between these two environments. Furthermore, different expansion stages of the small-cell deployments in both environments are discussed with respect to the coverage and interference situations."
3198652,20178,369,Particle-Based Message Compression for Cooperative Localization,2016,"We propose a novel message compression scheme for distributed nonparametric belief propagation in the context of cooperative localization. The messages to be exchanged in nonparametric belief propagation are given as particle representations. Communication constraints on the links make the transmission of entire particle representations prohibitive and require compressed (approximated) messages. We tackle the problem of compressing messages in an information-theoretic manner. For that reason, we define a relevant random variable and consider the mutual information shared with it for particle selection. We show that the shared mutual information depends on the choice of the particles. We propose a particle-based message compression algorithm that flexibly trades localization accuracy for communications, i.e. we incorporate a scalar parameter to adjust the degree of compression. We show that the proposed message compression method outperforms its parametrized counterpart in terms of localization accuracy for a well-chosen degree of compression, but comes at the expense of somewhat increased communications."

A new geolocation algorithm of interference source based on Taylor series expansion is proposed. This algorithm firstly gets the Taylor series expansion of FDOA measurements of interference signal, and then the original iterative location is corrected. It secondly gets the Taylor series expansion of earth constraint which original iterative location is the correction location of FDOA, and then the iterative location is corrected again. This iterative process repeats until it reaches to the convergence threshold. The simulation results show that the algorithm can achieve the CRLB and has a fast convergence speed. The introduction of earth constraint could improve the locating accuracy or reduces the least number of satellites in the positioning system."

To realize that the renewable energy supply traces the dynamically changing traffic, the traffic aware inventory policy of renewable energy at each BS is proposed. For each BS at each time period, the optimal inventory quantity of renewable energy which has the lowest inventory cost is derived and numerically simulated. Numerical results show that the optimal inventory quantity of renewable energy for each BS, changes along with the traffic quantity, and shortage cost and holding cost of renewable energy, and provides a baseline for energy cooperation between BSs."
2991437,20178,369,Enhancing Improved Heuristic Drift Elimination for Wrist-Worn PDR Systems in Buildings,2016,"Location based services are limited due to the weakness of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to work properly in indoor and dense urban environments. Among the different technologies proposed to provide indoor positioning, inertial sensors based pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) is one of the more cost- effective solutions thanks to no additional infrastructure is needed to be installed, but its performance is time-limited by drift problems. Regarding the heading drift, some heuristics make use of the buildings' dominant directions in order to reduce this problem. In this paper, the method known as improved heuristic drift elimination (iHDE) is enhanced to be implemented in a Step- and-Heading (SHS) based PDR system, that allows to place the inertial sensors in almost any location of the user's body. Particularly, wrist-worn sensors will be used. Tests on synthetically generated and real data show that the iHDE method can be used in a SHS-based PDR without losing its heading drift reduction capability."

We describe an approach in which nodes are logically partitioned into a number of zones so that nodes in a closer zone act as relays for nodes in the next more distant zone. We show that the optimum partitioning can be found through exhaustive search, and propose a simple heuristic algorithm that can improve the performance without undue deterioration of the network bandwidth."
2991243,20178,369,Transmission Protocol Design in Cognitive Cellular Heterogeneous Networks,2016,"The cellular heterogeneous networks (CHNs) are of great interest for the great potential of improving the network capacity by employing low-power, easy- deployment short-range mini-base stations (BSs). To cope with the challenge of inter-layer/inner-layer interference environment in such heterogeneous architecture, we introduce cognitive Radio (CR) in CHNs, and named it as CR Enabled cellular heterogeneous networks (CCHNs). However, the transmission protocol deign is crucial for the implement of CCHSs. For one thing, the division of sensing and access phase is vital for the sensing accuracy and spectrum efficiency; For another, the power spend on the spectrum sensing cuts the transmission power allocation budget. In this paper, such coupled problem is solved by a Bi-level optimization method, by which the joint problem is decoupled to the upper level power allocation subproblem and lower level slot partition subproblem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal jointing optimization of spectrum sensing and access, which alleviates the inter-layer interference between heterogeneous cells and improve the performance of entire network."

We show that ACLR exceeding -57 dBc @ 5 MHz offset, which completely satisfy the requirement defined in the 3GPP technical specification, can be achieved for a 20 W class Doherty power amplifier linearized through 1 km fiber with commercial RoF links. With the experimental results, we show that the achieved ACLR strongly depends on the RoF link noise figure; meanwhile most of the nonlinear distortions caused by RoF can be successively suppressed with the proposed joint linearization approach."
3031091,20178,369,Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithm for Spectrum Sensing in Sparse Satellite Cognitive Systems,2016,"We study the improved cuckoo search algorithm to promote the capability of spectrum sensing in satellite cognitive systems in this paper. We consider the application scenario of satellite network, which has relatively concise structures and flexible networking modes. The sharable frequency bands are divided into a number of subchannels, and cognitive users should discover unoccupied channels to access. In this case, the actual utilization of the spectrum is sparse as well as the changes in spectrum usage, so we propose an improved cuckoo search algorithm that adjusts dynamically the step size and switching/discovery probability in order to avoid redundant search and increase the convergence rate. Furthermore, we use simulations to study the performance of our proposed algorithm, which show the proposed scheme is noticeably efficient compared with the sequential search and a cuckoo search scheme with fixed step size and switching/discovery probability."

To materialize these opportunities, satellite communications services have to be provisioned and operated in a more flexible, agile and cost-effective manner than done today. In this context, this paper describes a solution for the virtualization and dynamic orchestration of satellite communication services that builds on the introduction of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies within the satellite ground segment systems. Along with the description of the main system architecture traits, the flowchart of a general procedure for the dynamic instantiation of virtualized satellite networks on top of a SDN/NFV-enabled satellite ground segment system is provided. The paper also presents experimental results for the dynamic customization of satellite network services through the implementation of a set of virtualized satellite network functions that can be orchestrated over general purpose open virtual platforms."
3041147,20178,369,Non-Cooperative Wi-Fi Localization via Monitoring Probe Request Frames,2016,"Most Wi-Fi based localization algorithms are cooperative as user device is required to associate with an AP. However, user may not associate with AP in scenarios such as supermarkets which calls for non-cooperative localization. In this paper, the probe request (PR) frame sent by device is analyzed and the weighted kernel density estimation assisted Bayes (w-KAB) algorithm is utilized for localization. The PR frame is sent in a sparse manner in time and the probability distribution of its receiving signal strength is complicated due to channel misalignment. Therefore kernel density estimation is adopted in the training stage to estimate the distribution of signal strength accurately with a limited amount of training data. In the localization stage, a weighted naive Bayes algorithm is used to estimate the location of user. Experiments are also conducted using off the shelf devices to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm."

In this paper, we propose a fast primary code acquisition technique for the Galileo E5 signal to reduce both hardware and algorithm complexities, while achieving a similar or better performance in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and mean acquisition time (MAT), respectively. The proposed technique employs a sub- Nyquist sampling scheme followed by a sample compression scheme to cause a complete aliasing between the spectra of E5a and E5b signals to minimize the signal bandwidth and to reduce the number of code phase hypothesis to search. We demonstrate with numerous Monte Carlo simulations that the MAT of the proposed technique is about a half of the conventional AltBOC acquisition techniques."
3007897,20178,369,Higher-Order Circularity Based I/Q Imbalance Compensation in Direct-Conversion Receivers,2016,"In-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance is a critical issue limit the achievable operating signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver in direct conversion architecture. In recent literatures, the second- and fourth-order circularity property of communication signals have been used for designing compensator to eliminate the I/Q imbalance. In this paper, we investigate whether moment circularity of an order higher than four can be used in receiver I/Q imbalance compensation. It is shown that the sixth- order moment E[z4z*2]$ is a suitable statistic for measuring the sixth-order circularity of representative communication signals such as M-QAM and M-PSK with M&#62;2. Two blind algorithms are then proposed to update the coefficients of I/Q imbalance compensator by restoring the sixth-order circularity of the compensator output signal. Simulation results show that the new proposed methods based on sixth-order statistic converges faster or gives lower steady-state variance than the reference methods that are based on second- and fourth-order statistics."

We propose two different sequential sensing schemes, i.e., detection before recognition and recognition before detection, and also derive the closed form decision regions. Performance of both schemes are compared. Numerical examples are then provided to corroborate the proposed studies."
3048024,20178,369,Intelligent Traffic Signal Duration Adaptation Using Q-Learning with an Evolving State Space,2016,"Vehicular traffic congestion is a major problem all over the world with significant economic and environmental impact. Adapting traffic signal durations is one method to alleviate this problem and has the advantage that it does not require any significant changes to existing infrastructure such as traffic poles and roads. Reinforcement learning is suitable for adapting the traffic signal durations since it does not require any prior knowledge of traffic patterns, which are time-varying and a priori unknown. In reinforcement learning based schemes proposed in previous studies, the algorithm for adapting the durations of a traffic signal takes into account only the vehicle queue lengths at that signal. In this paper, we propose a novel Q-Learning based algorithm, which adapts the durations of a signal by taking into account the vehicle queue lengths at all the signals that are n or fewer hops away from the signal, where n is a parameter that enables us to trade performance with computational complexity. In particular, our simulations show that as n increases, the performance of the algorithm improves in terms of travelling time, number of moving vehicles as well as Carbon dioxide emissions, albeit at the expense of an increase in computation time. Further, we consider the case in which n is increased gradually as time progresses, and show that the performance achieved is significantly better than in the case where n is a constant."

Numerical results demonstrate that the pulse shapes generated by this method, under certain settings, do converge to the known short perfect reconstruction (PR) prototype filters with the optimal time-frequency localization (TFL) property, whose coefficients are obtained from independently derived closed-form expressions. Moreover, the flexibility of the proposed method along with its efficiency makes it be a promising technique for the pulse shape design for future OFDM-based communication systems."

In this paper, we describe the operation of CE Mode B for the supported physical data and control channels, and study the dimensioning of this mode for each of these channels. We provide link-level simulation results for CE Mode B, which illustrate the possibility of MTC operation at a coupling loss up to 160 dB. Further, we study the achievable uplink capacity in terms of the blocking probability of new scheduling requests. Finally for a few representative scenarios, we show that the existing LTE configurations can provide sufficient uplink capacity."
3058073,20178,369,Throughput and Cost-Effectiveness of Vehicular Mesh Networks for Internet Access,2016,"Vehicular mesh networks can be used to carry Internet data traffic for mobile users. We use data from a real vehicular network that is operating in Portugal to estimate the relationship between network throughput and offered load of Internet traffic, quantity of vehicles, quantity of infrastructure and the use of Request-to-Send/Clear-to- Send (RTS/CTS) handshaking. We show that achievable throughput remains close to its maximum even for high levels of offered load per vehicle or high density of vehicles, so congestion control mechanisms in mesh networks can effectively prevent throughput from collapsing as these factors increase over time. This achievable throughput can be increased with the deployment of additional roadside infrastructure that serves as a gateway to the Internet, although the throughput gain per gateway decreases as more are added. Deploying these gateways is cost-effective, i.e. economic benefits of the resulting throughput exceed costs of infrastructure, when vehicle density is sufficiently high. We also find that use of RTS/CTS decreases achievable throughput in this scenario."
3107186,20178,369,Power Allocation for Cognitive Energy Harvesting and Smart Power Grid Coexisting System,2016,"Cognitive radio (CR) lifts efficiency of information resource. As one way of utilizing the renewable energy resources, energy harvesting makes use of energy from the environment. Due to intermitted feature of the renewable energy, the power grid needs to be integrated to regulate the harvested energy supply of the system. Thus, the transmit power of the second user (SU), including the power from both the renewable energy and the power grid is often subject to a peak power constraint to control the interference level of the SU to the primary user (PU). The combination of these three types of emerging communication machineries renders great challenge to provide exact optimal power allocation solution with rapid computation. To the best knowledge of the authors, no such kind of solutions were reported in the open literature. In this paper, our recently proposed geometric water-filling with peak power constraints (GWFPP) and recursion machinery are applied and exploited to solve the throughput maximization problems, making the power grid smart. The proposed algorithms are precisely defined. They provide the exact optimal solution with efficient finite computation. Their optimality is strictly proved. Numerical examples and computational complexity analysis are presented to illustrate the procedures and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

This scarcity can be solved by enabling secondary access to the licensed spectrum. The interference at the primary receiver can be avoided by employing a detector (spectrum sensing) at the Secondary Transmitter (ST). Energy detection is widely used due to its low complexity and applicability to a large range of primary user signals. Recently, antenna diversity techniques such as square-law selector and square-law combiner have been used to enhance the detection performance at the ST. In this context, the detector's performance pertaining to the antenna diversity techniques has been characterized analytically. However, issues such as RF impairments and deploying a fading model render hardware implementation of such techniques challenging. Motivated by this fact, this paper presents the deployment of a hardware, and subsequently utilize the theoretical expressions to validate the performance of a multi-antenna system at the ST that exploits antenna diversity techniques in a realistic environment. Finally, we emphasize the challenges faced during the hardware implementation and present our approach to address these challenges."

3198887,20178,369,A Novel QAM-FBMC without Intrinsic Time-Domain Interference,2016,"In the recent fifth generation (5G) research, filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) technique is one of the competitive substitutes to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The conventional FBMC schemes, such as FBMC staggered-modulated multitone (FBMC-SMT) and frequency spreading FBMC (FS-FBMC), have the intrinsic time-domain interference which is caused by the overlap of symbols and depend on offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM). In order to overcome the two drawbacks, a non-overlapping QAM-FBMC scheme is proposed based on the FBMC-SMT and analyzed in this paper. Moreover, the non-overlapping QAM-FBMC scheme not only discards cyclic prefix (CP) as other FBMC schemes, but also shortens the duration length of symbol waveforms compared with that of FS-FBMC. Therefore, its spectrum efficiency (SE) outperforms other multi-carrier systems. Simulation results indicate that non-overlapping QAM-FBMC scheme indeed improves the SE and obtains almost the same bit error rate performance as that of the FBMC-SMT as well as OFDM in multi-path fading channel."

3198496,20178,369,Energy-Aware Optimal Data Offloading over Unlicensed Spectrums,2016,"In this paper, we investigate the energy-aware data- offloading of mobile user (MU) which schedules its traffic demand to a macro Base Station (BS) and a small-cell access point (AP) simultaneously. For saving the usage of licensed spectrum, we consider that the MU uses unlicensed spectrum to offload data. The open access of unlicensed spectrum, however, results in that the MU's data offloading suffer from uncontrollable interference, which comprises the benefit of data offloading. We propose an outage-probability to quantify such an adverse influence and formulate a joint rate-splitting and power allocation problem to minimize a system-wise cost accounting for both the MU's power consumption and the BS's licensed channel usage. Despite the non-convexity of the joint optimization problem, we transform it into three rate- allocation problems under different cases and derive the respective optimal solutions, which yield the globally optimal solution for the original problem. Numerical results are provided to validate the optimal offloading-solution."

In this paper, we try to maximize secure energy efficiency (SEE) by allocating power for those User Equipments (UEs) meeting the security transmission requirements, where SEE is defined as the ratio of the total secrecy throughput to the total transmission power in the whole network. Concretely, we propose an efficient algorithm which uses the parametric programming and Difference of Convex (DC) function to solve the optimization problem (i.e. maximize secure energy efficiency). Finally, we compare the secure energy efficiency of our scheme with that of fixed power allocation schemes and show the results through simulations at different system conditions."

2991160,20178,369,A Sparsity-Aware Approach for NBI Estimation and Mitigation in Large Cognitive Radio Networks,2016,"Underlay cognitive networks should follow strict interference thresholds to operate in parallel with primary networks. This constraint limits their transmission power and eventually the coverage area. Therefore, in this paper, we first design a new approach for asynchronous narrow-band interference (NBI) estimation and mitigation in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing cognitive radio networks that does not require prior knowledge of the NBI characteristics. Our proposed approach allows the primary user to exploit the sparsity of the secondary users' interference signal to recover it and cancel it based on sparse signal recovery theory. We also propose two subcarrier selection schemes that allow the primary user to further reduce the effect of the secondary users' interference based on sparse signal recovery algorithms. We show that although the primary and secondary transmissions are performed at the same time, the performance of our proposed techniques approach the interference- free limit over practical ranges of NBI power levels."

We recently reported a weighted CAF diversity combining technique, however, the weight factor has a noise component, which negatively affects the performance. This technique reduces the noise component included in weight factors, by averaging a large number of CAFs, and we attempt to improve the performance of spectrum sensing.

1082542,20178,369,Distributed Computing Through Web Browser,2007,"This paper proposes a new approach for distributed computing. The main novelty consists in the exploitation of web browsers as clients, thanks to the availability of Javascript and AJAX. The described solution has two main advantages: it is client- free, so no additional programs have to be installed to perform the computation, and it requires low CPU usage, so clientside computation is no invasive for users. The solution is developed using AJAX technology embedding a pseudoclient into a web page that hosts che computation. While users browse the hosting web page, computation takes place resolving single subproblems and sending the solution to the serverside part of the system. The new architecture has been tested through various performance metrics by implementing two examples of distributed computing, the RSA crack and the correlation index between genetic data sets. Results have shown good feasibility of this approach."
3119093,20178,369,Network Coding Based BSM Broadcasting at Road Intersection in V2V Communication,2016,"Basic safety message(BSM) or heartbeat message is periodically broadcast by each vehicle on the road, conveying vehicle's instantaneous position and driving state. The vehicular communication network enables the fast exchange of BSMs with neighboring vehicles which assists drivers in acquiring the local driving environment and maneuvering promptly in case of any potential hazard. Such message is exceptionally crucial for vehicles at road intersection to avoid collisions. In this paper, we propose a novel BSM broadcast scheme using random linear network coding (NCB-RI) to address the message dissemination at road intersection. Considering each BSM packet broadcast occupies one broadcast slot, our objective is to reduce the required number of broadcast slots and lower the total transmission time for exchanging all BSMs among the studied vehicles. The coding overhead caused by the random linear network coding is further deducted by using coefficient seeds. The upper bounds regarding the broadcast slots for both NCB-RI and traditional broadcast scheme without network coding are discussed.

Due to this, signalling mechanisms are inefficient for small packet payloads. Future trends predict an explosion of sporadic small packet transmissions due to machine type and always-ON type applications. Therefore, we target signalling minimization in 5G. In particular, we define user and service centric connection and mobility management by 5G radio access network (5G-RAN). The key idea is to anchor the core network connection for a user in 5G-RAN with the help of a user centric mobility area. This area is dynamically managed by 5G-RAN for each user. For a mobile user within this area, we minimize the core network signalling related to connection transitions, paging and handover. We present the performance assessment of our proposal with the help of simulations. The results show significant gains in terms of signalling reduction with respect to 4G-LTE approach."
3021369,20178,369,A Study of the Ranging Error for Parallel Double Sided-Two Way Ranging Protocol,2016,"Indicating its own position is an important ability for a mobile wireless node. As a matter of fact, it is a key enabler for future applications in fields as diverse as routing, security, logistics, entertainment and so on. This position can be computed in many different ways. In a protocol-based approach to positionning, the foundation of this localisation service is the ranging protocol. In this paper, we focus on Time of Flight (ToF)-based localisation. We investigate the performance in terms of ranging precision of our proposed protocol, Parallel Double Sided-Two Way Ranging. We define the mathematical model which allows prediction of the error behaviour and derive a dynamic correction tool. We then implement our solution using the Decaduino platform and verify our model's ability to identify the real distance. Using the correction method derived from the model in a real indoor environment, we were able to reduce the ranging error by at least 90%."
3248278,20178,369,A Novel Spectrum Sensing Mechanism Based on Distribution Discontinuity Estimation within Cognitive Radio,2016,"A novel spectrum sensing approach based on distribution discontinuity estimation facilitated by change-point (CP) detection algorithm has been presented in this work. Specifically, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based CP detection algorithm to estimate the variations in the distribution over the received signal is developed. Primary User (PU) activity, autonomous classification of modulation and detection of PU emulation attempts are detected using the CP- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) framework. Specifically, the CP based approach facilitates PU activity detection and initiates the MLE based mechanism to discern or reveal the underlying modulation scheme within the received signal. Thus, the proposed joint CP-MLE framework not only aims at detecting the discontinuity or the variations in the underlying distribution over the sensed signal, but also helps in attributing those variations to distinct modulation schemes, in an effort to identify PU emulation attempts. This CP- MLE framework has been extensively validated using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices for various types of scenarios involving real-time modulation classification and identification of PU emulation type attacks."
2885670,20178,369,Cyclic Prefix Adaptation with Constant Overall Symbol Time for DFT-Spread-OFDM and OFDM,2016,"For DFT-spread-OFDM or OFDM, if the delay spread varies in a wide range and the symbol duration is relatively short, adapting the cyclic prefix (CP) duration rather than using a fixed one may significantly improve the spectral efficiency while preventing inter-symbol interference (ISI). In practice, it may be beneficial to have a constant overall DFT-spread-OFDM/OFDM symbol time, which is the sum of the duration of a CP and the duration of a data portion. We propose to adapt the CP duration to the delay spread without changing the overall symbol time for DFT-spread-OFDM or OFDM, and address implementation challenges. In particular, we propose changing the clocking rate of ADC and DAC or using a Farrow filter to reduce the computational complexity of arbitrary-size DFT/IDFT resulting from the adaptation."
3021511,20178,369,Self-Interference Mitigation Using Active Signal Injection for Full-Duplex MIMO-OFDM Systems,2016,"This paper presents two self-interference (SI) cancellation methods using active signal injection (ASI) for full-duplex MIMO-OFDM systems. Specifically, the ASI approach considers adding an appropriate cancelling signal to the transmitted signal to reduce the SI at the receiver input to avoid overloading the receiver low-noise amplifier (LNA) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) while ensuring proper signal detection. In the first method, the cancelling signal uses some reserved subcarriers that are not used for data transmission. In the second method, the constellation points are dynamically extended within the cancellation boundary in order to minimize the SI. The proposed techniques appear to be simple to implement and do not require any change on the receiver structure."
3047877,20178,369,Terrain Based GPS Independent Lane-Level Vehicle Localization Using Particle Filter and Dead Reckoning,2016,"The need of accurate and reliable positioning in various location-aware safety critical transportation applications is increasing day by day. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is not able to provide lane-level vehicle localization without the aid of differential corrections. It also suffers from signal outages in urban areas resulting in a complete loss of location information. Therefore, GPS independent localization methods are now being developed. In this domain, inertial sensors along with a terrain map have been successfully deployed to achieve sub-meter level accuracy in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle in an urban environment. However, lateral localization of the vehicle with good accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenging topic. Existing algorithms are computationally intensive, and do not provide location information during the process of lane change by the vehicle. This information is very crucial as the risk of potential conflict with nearby vehicles is higher during lane changes. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient method for achieving lane-level localization in a multi-lane scenario by combining the particle filter with dead- reckoning. The particle filter provides the location information about a single lane while location information during the lane change maneuvers is provided by dead-reckoning. Lane- change maneuvers are detected by constantly observing the yaw rate of the vehicle. Developing a computationally efficient algorithm enables the GPS independent localization algorithm to be run on low cost micro-controllers making its deployment feasible for packaged devices. Experiments performed on an instrumented vehicle show the superiority of the proposed algorithm on the existing ones."
2991375,20178,369,Optimal Approach to Provide Electric Vehicles with Charging Service by Using Mobile Charging Stations in Heterogeneous Networks,2016,"Mobile charging stations (MCSs) can provide electric vehicles (EVs) with better charging services than the fixed charging stations, as the flexible and efficient charging sites can be available. However, how to schedule the tasks from the EVs and optimally place the MCSs becomes a new challenge. Therefore, in this paper we present a novel approach to help EVs$^{'}$ charging with MCSs through heterogeneous networks. Firstly, a novel heterogeneous network model is presented to improve the communication between EVs and MCSs by using macro cells and small cells. Next, a novel model is developed to make optimal decisions for MCSs to schedule the tasks from EVs. Then, a chaotic evolution particle swarm optimization (CEPSO) algorithm is presented to determine the optimal placement of MCSs based on the charging demand and the maintenance cost. Finally, the simulation experiments prove that the proposed approach can outperform the conventional methods."
3000768,20178,369,A Scalable Application and System Level-Based Communication Scheme for V2V Communications,2016,"To deal with the congestion problem in a broadcast environment like V2V communication, we believe that receiving nodes should take a role in guiding transmitting nodes to set their transmission parameters e.g., Tx rate and power. This is important because only receiving nodes can evaluate whether or not safety applications requirements have been fulfilled. While most congestion control protocols rely on network-level metrics to optimize their transmission parameters, our proposed method uses a combination of application and network level performance metrics to assign transmission parameters. In the proposed method, nodes calculate the max tolerable time between periodic messages as well as the channel load, and share it with others. The shared data is used to guide neighboring nodes in regulating their messaging rate and Tx power. Receiving nodes adapt their rate or/and power based on their locations w.r.t to the node with degraded safety applications performance. The evaluation shows that our method maintains low inter packet reception time."

3198804,20178,369,Game Theory-Based Energy Efficiency Optimization for Multi-User Cognitive Radio over MIMO Interference Channels,2016,"A non-cooperative game approach is employed to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) for multi-user cognitive radio over multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) interference channels (ICs). Both the per-secondary-user (SU) power constraints and the total interference threshold are taken into consideration in the problem formulation. Although optimizing EE for the formulated multi-constraint fractional problem is non-convex and multi-objective, we show that it can be reformulated as an equivalent multi-objective unconstrained non-fractional problem. A distributed iterative EE optimization algorithm (DIEEOA) for multi-user cognitive radio over MIMO ICs is proposed to achieve the Nash Equilibrium of the non-cooperative game. Effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through computer simulation, and system parameters' impact on the EE is discussed."

We add a new function to current hybrid systems, which is responsible for operation mode selection (OMS). A dynamic OMS policy is proposed by taking intelligent control decisions at the transmitter taking into account states of both queue and channel (i.e. queue-aware and channel- aware). System performance metrics are analytically studied based on a combination of queuing and Markov chain theories. Numerical results quantitatively show how the proposed operation outperforms the conventional ones."

We develop a multi-charger framework considering both the customers' and charging station's interests. First, an admission control mechanism is proposed to guarantee that all admitted EVs' charging requirements can be satisfied before their departure time. Then, under the premise of declining the customers' requirements as little as possible, a Joint Searching (JS) scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the profit of the charging station. Extensive simulations based on realistic EV charging information and TOU pricing have been conducted. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art solution in terms of up to 30% profit and similar service declining probability."

In this paper, we investigate the joint impact. First, we obtain the closed-form expression of SU's capacity considering both limited energy supply and imperfect spectrum sensing. Then, we maximize SU's capacity while satisfying detection probability constraint and guaranteeing that the harvested energy is sufficient to transmit a certain amount of data payload. Simulation results prove that the optimized energy harvesting duration and spectrum sensing parameters dramatically improve SU's capacity."
3039019,20178,369,Cluster-Based Joint Cell Association and Interference Coordination Control in Heterogeneous Networks,2016,"In this paper, a joint control method for the user association and almost blank sub-frame (ABSF) based interference coordination (IC) technique in heterogeneous cellular networks is proposed. The optimization objective is simultaneously improving system throughput and guaranteeing proportionally fairness. Usually, user and base station (UE-BS) association is performed before ABSF rate determination, which is suboptimal with respect to UE- BS association. We formulate the joint optimization of UE-BS association and ABSF rate as a combinatorial optimization problem. To deal with it, we proposed an iterative method to discover the ABSF rate, the optimal association and the optimal resource blocks(RBs) allocation that can maximum long-term average throughput. Besides, as we cannot know the interference before user-association and resource allocation, we proposed a graph-based BS clustering method to estimate the interference before user-association and resource allocation. Simulation results show the efficiency of our proposed scheme."

This vehicle is in worldwide services and especially for the European sites, CENELEC compliance is required. Traditional input filter design for both the propulsion inverter and the aux inverter based on the power device's switching frequency, input filter parameters and harmonic limits calculation are not adequate when line resonance is included. Parasitic capacitance between the IGBT devices and the grounded inverter's heatsink can lead the switching harmonic current sneak out to the power rails and not attenuated by the input filters. The power rails which need to be treated as transmission lines resonant with the leaked out high frequency switching current and causing radiated emission exceeding the limits. Because of this, shielding of the inverter boxes or the car body would not work. An investigation is described and a shunting capacitor and ferrite core formed common mode (CM) filter solution is proven to be effective."
3107185,20178,369,A Lithium-Ion Battery Electro-Thermal Model of Parallellized Cells,2016,"Often groups of cells in parallel are assumed to behave as one single larger unit, with homogeneous properties. Although this assumption may seem correct , it is partly false because it neglects the impact of cell to cell current variations and the self balancing currents on pack characteristics. Modeling small cells into one larger unit hinders the possibility of studying the effects of internal resistance or state-of- charge variations between cells, on current distribution and heat generation. A better understanding of the subtle interactions that usually goes unwhitnessed inside a pack is necessary to design better battery systems. This article presents a simple electro-thermal battery model based on experimental data of electrical and thermal properties of single cells., useful for design purposes or reliability assesment. The model integrates state-of -the-art cell submodels, linked together via thermal and electrical networks. Model parameters such as the entropic coefficient, internal resistance correction and open circuit voltage are interpolated using experimental lookup tables. Simulation results of a full discharge, a full recharge and an interrupted discharge are presented, as examples."
3052159,20178,369,Throughput Evaluation of Dynamic Frame Slotted ALOHA for Spatially Distributed RFID Tags,2016,"In this paper, we evaluate throughput performance of spatially distributed RFID tags where tags closer to the reader will be at an advantage of having the possibility of being captured more frequently by the reader. We provide an analysis of the optimal frame length during reader interrogation rounds and show that it depends on the probability of capture. Over successive rounds of Dynamic Frame Slotted ALOHA, DFSA, the reader tends to finalize interrogation of closer tags with stronger received power and leaves the reading field to be predominantly populated by farther ones with relatively weaker received power. As a result, it is anticipated that capture probability decreases after each DFSA round. Accordingly, a Linear Frame Length Stepping Algorithm LFLSA for frame length selection in each DFSA round is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the capture probability is linearly varied from its initial value of the first DFSA round until it reaches zero at the final rounds where all remaining tags are essentially received with equal power. Simulation results show that applying LFLSA introduces a (7% - 11%) gain in the achieved slot throughput depending on the RFID system environment when compared to other frame length setting that has been widely utilized in the literature that assumes 100% successful capture of any scenario of two-tags collision timeslots."
3198859,20178,369,An Adaptive Ternary Query Splitting Based Tag Anti-Collision Protocol for Mobile RFID Systems,2016,"Tag collision occurs easily when the multiple tags respond to the same reader query simultaneously over a shared wireless channel. The solution of tag collision is a significant issue in the mobile RFID environment, because of the random mobility of tags. For the purpose of object tracking, locating and monitoring, the reader will repeatedly identify the same tags which still stay within its read range, which will waste a lot of resources and add some new collisions. To handle the above case well, we propose a tag anti-collision protocol based on adaptive ternary query splitting (ATQS), which can effectively avoid the collisions between the new arriving tags and the original staying tags by the blocking technique. Using the formula for the conversion of binary to ternary, the number and length of queries are simplified by a ternary query tree. Using the ternary resolution technique, the new processing procedure of tag identification is designed, in which the reader can use only one prefix of ID to identify at most three staying tags having the same prefix. From the simulation and performance analysis, it obtains that our protocol can effectively decrease the identification delay, which outperforms the previous protocols with the impacts of the staying ratio, the arriving radio and the number of tags."

With the help of vehicular global positioning system (GPS) data, the taxi demand distribution of city can be analyzed to provide advice for drivers. A clustering algorithm called Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is suitable for discovering demand hotspots. However, the execution efficiency is still a big challenge when DBSCAN is applied on big databases. In this paper, we propose an improved density-based clustering algorithm called Grid and Kd-tree for DBSCAN (GD-DBSCAN), which integrates partitioning method with kd-tree structure to improve the computational performance of DBSCAN. Furthermore, this algorithm can take advantages of multi cores and shared memory to parallelize related functions. The experiment shows GD- DBSCAN is efficient, it has an improvement of at least 10% in performance compared with DBSCAN."
3106974,20178,369,Mitigating Power Consumption in Mobile Devices with Dynamic Triggering of XMPP Ping Requests,2016,"With the penetration of smart phone usage, IP based Chat and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications is increasing very rapidly. Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is one of the highly used protocols for instant messaging and presence information. XMPP employs pinging at regular interval of times for checking the connection status, to avoid server idle connection time. These pinging messages consume more battery power in mobile devices. In this paper we proposed an algorithm to reduce the number of pinging messages between two XMPP entities by dynamically triggering the XMPP ping requests, based on sending and receiving of other XMPP messages, signal strength, Round Trip Times, Timeouts and mobility. Relative priorities for Round Trip Time, Timeouts and Signal Strength are calculated using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Using Simulation method, we analyzed the impact of dynamic triggering of ping requests algorithm for mitigating power consumption, with best case, worst case and compared with that of the existing system. Expected battery life has been increased, varying between 3 minutes to 34 minutes in different scenarios. Data usage is also reduced from 2.07 MB to 0.064 MB during a period of 24 hours."
3198746,20178,369,Risk Assessment for Traffic Safety Applications with V2V Communications,2016,"Vehicle-to-others (V2X) communication systems intend to increase safety and efficiency of our transportation networks. However, wireless communication imperfections such as missed messages due to collisions and fading in the wireless channel, may affect safety application reliability and lead to risky situations. Thus metrics are required to evaluate the impact of communication inadequacies on the safety applications. In this paper we perform analyses of various existing safety application reliability metrics and conclude that they do not reflect safety application risk and vulnerability of individual nodes effectively. We propose a new metric called Effective Risk Factor (ERF), which quantifies the risk at a node for each link, to identify dangers due to poor awareness of their neighbors. The ERF evaluation considers links of its neighbors, thus detecting risky situations over existing neighbor links on runtime making the ERF assessment realistic. The ERF metric is evaluated and compared with other reliability metrics for a stationary vehicle warning application in a simulated highway scenario. The results show that the ERF evaluation performed at each node on runtime is able to capture a fine time scale fluctuations in the risk experienced by an application precisely. The ERF also enables prediction of higher risk situations. The results also demonstrate that the ERF captures application risk experienced by nodes effectively compared to other reliability metrics."

In the x-EV system, electric traction motor is the most important part act as the engine of the conventional vehicle. The design trend of the electric motor for EV traction is the high-speed low-torque with the reduction gear. For this reason, high speed operating condition should be considered in the design process. In this paper, some design factor study was done, considering both the electrical performance and the mechanical stress. Using these study results and response surface method (RSM) optimum design was conducted. From the optimum designed motor, mechanical stress simulation was done considering about the 15% margin of the maximum operating speed of the electric motor.

2991174,20178,369,A Complete Observation Model for Tracking Vehicles from Mobile Phone Signal Strengths and Its Potential in Travel-Time Estimation,2016,"Tracking vehicles from mobile phones has applications, among others, in traffic monitoring, location-based services, and personal navigation. We address the problem of tracking vehicles from received signal strength (RSS) sequences generated by mobile phones carried by passengers. A mobile phone periodically measures the RSS levels from the associated cell tower and several (six for GSM) strongest neighbor cell towers. Each such measurement is known as an RSS fingerprint. However, due to various effects, the contents of fingerprints may vary over time even when measured at the same location. These variations have two components. First is the fluctuation of the RSS levels. Second is the variation of the set of cell towers reported in fingerprints. The latter is not properly modeled by traditional methods. To address both components of variation, we propose a probabilistic model for RSS fingerprints that specifies for each gird-location in the area of interest, the distribution of the probability of observing any fingerprint at that location. We then use it as the observation model of a Dynamic Bayesian Network to track vehicles. Experiments on several roads demonstrate a 40% reduction in average error with our method compared to its traditional counterparts. Using RSS sequences of phone calls made by road users, our algorithm produced better travel-time estimates than comparison methods for a selected road segment with an average error of 13% with respect to travel-times computed through manual license plate recognition."

GPS-based positioning is reliable and accurate for outdoor situations, but it does not provide acceptable performance indoors. In indoor environments or when GPS functionality is turned off, fingerprinting geolocation techniques using available network measurements are a very promising alternative. In this paper, a 3D geolocation algorithm for Long Term Evolution (LTE) call traces is presented,one that enhances 2D geolocation methods and uses available measurement reports to locate mobile users in three dimensional space.

In order to deal with the high outage possibilities caused by penetration loss and signaling storm of group handover when communicating with the wayside cellular network directly. The High-Speed Train (HST) WiFi network, which provides passengers` information access within the carriages, emerges at the moment. However, there are still some issues which are not well addressed. With more users accessing to the WiFi network, the onboard relay connecting both of wayside cellular network and carriage WiFi network becomes a bottleneck, which significantly affects the network performance. Furthermore, by abstracting each carriage as a sub-network, the HST WiFi network can be seen as a tandem multi-hop network which will raise other challenges such as the end-to-end error accumulation and the bandwidth progressive loss carriage by carriage. In this paper, we obtain the arrival process of each sub-network by using a decomposition method and a parameter fitting algorithm. Then, we model the sub-network as a discrete-time finite capacity queuing system with packets splitting by a Markov Modulated Bernoulli Process (MMBP)/G/1/K queue. In addition, we use Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) in each sub- network to relieve the end-to-end error accumulation. Through the analysis of the stationary queue length distribution, average delay and packet loss probability, we obtain the optimal buffer size to ease the traffic congestion and give some suggestions on resource allocation of HST WiFi network."

In general, SIC performance is degraded by the estimation errors in CSI caused by interference and temporal channel variations. This paper introduces a scheme to appropriately weight and combine pre-CSI, defined as CSI estimated for transmitting power control (TPC), and post-CSI, defined as CSI estimated in the SIC process. The combined CSI is more robust against interference and temporal channel variation because pre-CSI and post-CSI resist the former and the latter, respectively. Simulation results show that the combined CSI improves the number of simultaneous transmitting terminals (directly related to interference) 17% (vs. post-CSI) and 5% (vs. pre-CSI), and the allowable environmental speed (directly related to temporal channel variation) 50% (vs. pre-CSI)."
3248222,20178,369,Asymptotic Analysis of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing under Noise Uncertainty,2016,"In Cognitive Radio (CR), secondary radios are allowed to use the spectrum allocated to primary radios (PR) only if the spectrum is sensed to be unused by the PR users. Cooperative spectrum sensing is a sensing methodology in which secondary users send their detection results to a central fusion node for global decision. It has been shown that for single node detection, SNR wall provides a hard threshold on the sensed SNR for robust signal detection. In this paper, asymptotic performance of cooperative spectrum sensing with Hard Decision Combining (HDC) will be studied under noise uncertainty. It is first shown that under noise uncertainty, SNR wall is yet a substantial constraint on the performance of the cooperative spectrum sensing when applying HDC. We then show that k-out-of-n fusion rule with finite k (e.g., OR rule) does not result in robust detection of the PR signal, even for SNR values greater than SNR wall. Finally, it is shown that for SNR values greater than the SNR wall, the PR signal can be robustly detected by the k-out-of-n fusion rule with finite n &#8722; k (e.g., AND rule)."
2897576,20178,369,Online Power Allocation for Opportunistic Radio Access in Dynamic OFDM Networks,2016,"User mobility has become a key attribute in the design of optimal resource allocation policies for future wireless networks. This has become increasingly apparent in cognitive radio (CR) systems where the licensed, primary users (PU) of the network must be protected from harmful interference by the network's opportunistic, secondary users (SU): here, unpredictability due to mobility requires the implementation of safety net mechanisms that are provably capable of adapting to changes in the users' wireless environment. In this context, we propose a distributed learning algorithm that allows SUs to adjust their power allocation profile (over the available frequency carriers) ``on the fly'', relying only on strictly causal channel state information. To account for the interference caused to the network's PUs, we incorporate a penalty function in the rate-driven objectives of the SUs, and we show that the proposed scheme matches asymptotically the performance of the best fixed power allocation policy in hindsight. Specifically, in a system with S orthogonal subcarriers and transmission horizon T, this performance gap (known as the algorithm's average regret) is bounded from above as &#959;(T^{-1} log(S)). We also validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations which confirm that the network's SUs rapidly achieve a ``no-regret'' state under realistic wireless cellular conditions. Moreover, by finetuning the choice of penalty function, the interference induced by the SUs can be kept at a sufficiently low level, thus guaranteeing the PUs' requirements."
3031059,20178,369,Disaster Management and Response for Modern Cellular Networks Using Flow-Based Multi-Hop Device-to-Device Communications,2016,"Modern wireless broadband networks are crucial for different mission-critical applications and public safety agencies. Various natural disasters and physical attacks would result in the malfunction or failure of wireless and cellular infrastructures. This subsequently affects the correct functioning of the dependent mission- critical applications. Thus, disaster management and response is of great importance. In this paper, we focus on disaster response using D2D communications to extend the coverage of base stations, and on controller-assisted routing to maximize the total end-to-end throughput for all of the current flows from the area without network coverage using the ant colony optimization. The proposed routing scheme outperforms the schemes based on the shortest path routing in terms of the total throughput as well as fairness in allocating the rates to the flows."
3198508,20178,369,Redundancy Adaptation for Multi-Path Intra-Flow Network Coding in Wireless Mesh Networks,2016,"Network coding can significantly enhance throughput and reliability in loss prone wireless networks. Adapting network coding redundancy is critical, since over-redundancy wastes network resources and hurts performance and under-estimated redundancy prevents decoding at destination. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between application tolerated loss rate and network overhead introduced by network coding redundancy. We first propose an analytic model that determines a simple redundancy bound to adapt network coding redundancy according to the measured packet loss rate and the targeted maximum application loss rate. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm with adaptive redundancy for reliable data delivery in wireless meshes. In the algorithm, each node opportunistically makes use of multiple paths available in the network to deliver data to the destination. We demonstrate the benefits of our schemes through simulation in various network scenarios."
3001997,20178,369,Design and Characterization of a 77 GHz Six-Port Modulator for an Automobile Radar,2016,"A quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 16 Quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) modulator based on the six-port technique were designed and simulated at the center frequency of 77 GHz over 10 GHz bandwidth. It is composed of a six-port passive microwave network to implement the modulation scheme with suitable variable load as impedance terminations. Its most important application of this modulator is for the automotive industry. It perform accurate distance and Doppler frequency measurements by means of the phase difference between transmitted and received signals. It has potentially the advantage of low power consumption, high signal to noise ratio, compactness and simplicity in realization. Harmonic balance, qi points analysis, and homodyne quadratic modulation were performed to analysis the performance of the six-port correlator. It is shown that the proposed six-port modulator offers accurate QPSK and 16-QAM symbol modulations at high symbol rate across a bandwidth from 72 to 82 GHz."
2910017,20178,369,Validation of Tilt Gain under Realistic Path Loss Model and Network Scenario,2013,"Despite being a simple and commonly-applied radio optimization technique, the impact on practical network performance from base station antenna downtilt is not well understood. Most published studies based on empirical path loss models report tilt angles and performance gains that are far higher than practical experience suggests. We motivate in this paper, based on a practical LTE scenario, that the discrepancy partly lies in the path loss model, and shows that a more detailed semi-deterministic model leads to both lower gains in terms of SINR, outage probability and downlink throughput and lower optimum tilt settings. Furthermore, we show that a simple geometrically based tilt optimization algorithm can outperform other tilt profiles, including the setting applied by the cellular operator in the specific case. In general, the network performance is not highly sensitive to the tilt settings, including the use of electrical and/or mechanical antenna downtilt, and therefore it is possible to find multiple optimum tilt profiles in a practical case. A broader implication of this study is that care must be taken when using the 3GPP model to evaluate advanced adaptive antenna techniques, especially those operating in the elevation dimension."
3023908,20178,369,Asynchronous Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio,2016,"We consider a cognitive radio network of nodes with full duplex capability where Self-Interference Suppression (SIS) is not perfect. We have proposed a new scheme for sensing and transmission of Secondary Users (SUs) with two modes of operation; Cooperative Sensing (CS) mode and Full Duplex Transmit and Receive (FDTR) mode. Cooperative sensing is applied to reduce misdetection probability and to avoid collision with primary users. Upon successful detection of a spectrum hole, both SUs start bidirectional communication in the FDTR mode in an asynchronous manner to decrease average collision duration while doubling throughput. Analytical closed forms for collision probability, average collision duration, and throughput of SUs are derived and impact of imperfect SIS and SUs' frame duration on network performance are investigated."
3047789,20178,369,Traffic Profile Based Clustering for Dynamic TDD in Dense Mobile Networks,2016,"The traffic profile of future mobile networks is foreseen as becoming more variable both in time and among base stations (BSs) due to the widespread heterogeneity in applications and services. Dynamic time division duplex (TDD) has been recognized as an important enabler to cope with this traffic variability, especially in dense networks with many BSs and a small number of user equipments (UEs) served by each BS. In this context, one of the main issues is to develop an incisive scheme to manage the BS-to-BS and UE-to- UE interference that arises. In this work, we propose a novel long-term BS clustering scheme that groups BSs that have a similar traffic profile and would be characterized, without clustering, by strong BS-to-BS interference. Due to the complexity of the optimal solution, we propose a heuristic algorithm which solves the optimization problem efficiently. Numerical evaluations in a dense homogeneous pico BS network show that the proposed scheme strongly outperforms even the baseline dynamic TDD without clustering by ensuring a reduction in packet delay of up to 55% and a gain in the UE packet throughput of about 75%."
2864223,20178,369,Propagation Characteristics of Mobile Channel in Urban Micro-Cells at 3.5 GHz and 6 GHz,2016,"In this paper, the mobile channel propagation measurements at 3.5 GHz and 6 GHz have been performed in urban micro-cell scenario in the city of China. The measured cases include line-of-sight (LOS) and non- line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Statistical results and comparative analysis are presented in this paper, including power delay profiles (PDPs), path loss (PL), coverage, and root mean square (rms) delay spread (DS). It can be found that PDPs measured from campaign keep similarity in these two bands. The result based on PDPs demonstrates that, in mobile condition, the PL exponent of 6 GHz is a little greater than that of 3.5 GHz in both LOS and NLOS propagation. Moreover, as the frequency increases, the path loss will increase and the coverage will remarkably degrade. Last, the rms DS of 3.5 GHz and 6 GHz are similar in LOS case, while that of 3.5 GHz is higher in NLOS case."
3040916,20178,369,System Capacity of 72 GHz mmWave Transmission in Hybrid Networks,2016,"Applying 6-100 GHz spectrum to mobile communications is a promising topic in 5G. In this paper, a hybrid network is presented where LTE system at low frequency works for seamless coverage and a mmWave system at 72 GHz works in hotspots for capacity enhancement. The scheme for the hybrid network includes: 1) frame structure and OFDM-based numerology for 72 GHz; 2) time-space beam switching method for beamforming; 3) zero-forcing MIMO precoding for interference cancellation; 4) a channel model based on measurements in [1] for simulation. System-level simulations show that the hybrid network can achieve the system throughput over 1600 times higher than that in 2 GHz frequency band in case of two streams. MIMO precoding is not mandatory for capacity enhancements because the effect of intra-cell interference is not severe. Thus, 72 GHz is a promising spectrum band that can well meet 5G requirements from the aspects of capacity and maximum data rate."
3007450,20178,369,PLC Performance Evaluation with Non-Uniform Background Noise Phase,2016,"Power line communication (PLC) has recently grabbed the attention of the researchers owing to its huge potential to provide high speed access to video and data. Since power lines were not initially designed for communication purposes, they offer a difficult communication environment in the form of impulsive noise and multiplicative noise, in addition to the background noise. This elucidates the need for evaluating the performance of PLC systems by taking into account all these factors. In this paper, we study the performance of a PLC system in the presence of Rayleigh channel gain under the combined effects of Nakagami-m distributed background noise with non- uniformly distributed phase and Middleton class A distributed impulsive noise. We evaluate closed- form expressions of the analytical average bit error rate for different cases depending on the presence or absence of impulsive noise and channel gain. We provide a further insight into the system by obtaining the diversity of the PLC system. Our analysis is validated by a close matching with the simulation results."
3248191,20178,369,Propagation Characteristics of Indoor Radio Channel from 3.5 GHz to 28 GHz,2016,"In this paper, the channel propagation measurements have been performed in indoor scenario at 3.5, 6, 14, 23, 26 and 28 GHz. The measured cases include line-of- sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Statistical results and comparative analysis are presented in this paper, including path loss (PL) and root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS). Both floating-intercept (FI) path loss model and alpha-beta- gamma (ABG) path loss model are provided. For the LOS propagation, path loss exponents at different bands are less than or closed to 2. PL exponents range from 2.7 to 4.2 in NLOS case. By fitting ABG PL model for each frequency band, the frequency dependent factors are observed as 2.21 and 2.33 in LOS and NLOS environments respectively. However, no tendency is found between the RMS DS and frequency in indoor scenarios. RMS DS seem not decreases with the increment of frequency bands. We also find that the RMS DS at any given location increases with separation distance and fluctuates seriously at larger distance."
3041005,20178,369,5G Experimental Trial Achieving over 20 Gbps Using Advanced Multi-Antenna Solutions,2016,"We propose a trial concept that utilizes advanced multi-antenna solutions such as beamforming and spatial multiplexing with a massive number of antenna elements for use in a previously established trial system for the fifth generation (5G) mobile broadband communications system.

329123,20178,369,Prescriptive Analytics Based Autonomic Networking for Urban Streams Services Provisioning,2015,"Smart Cities represents a large living lab environment. Due to intensively interconnected and overlapped types of systems the approach to extract effective paths to the right information on the right time raise large problems in terms of data processing capabilities. Streams acquired from all around a city raise specific challenges regarding appropriate ways to use, to extract valuable insights. In this paper is presented an ongoing work in CityPulse project regarding a new approach to look on the convergence between autonomic networking and stream based prescriptive analytics applied to dynamic city problems. Research presented aim to highlight the possible role of prescriptive analytics inside the autonomic loop, with an obvious focus on analysis step.

3002070,20178,369,Angular Resolved Pathloss Measurements in Urban Macrocell Scenarios at 28 GHz,2016,"This paper presents angular resolved measurements in two urban macro scenarios at 28 GHz. The result confirms that the propagation at this relatively high frequency is mainly driven by line-of-sight (LOS) and reflections/scattering. The majority of the energy was contained either in a LOS path or in specular reflections or reflections off smaller objects such as scaffolding, drain pipes, light poles, bikes, and balconies. At all 200 randomly chosen receiver locations up to 350 meters from the transmitter a detectable signal was received in both scenarios and an excess loss of up to 55 dB was measured."
2844010,20178,369,Terrain-Based Vehicle Localization Using Low Cost MEMS-IMU Sensors,2016,"This paper presents a method for localizing a land vehicle using low cost MEMS IMU sensors and a terrain map in global positioning system (GPS) denied environment. Previous attempts to localize a vehicle based on terrain information used a tactical grade IMU which is not cost-effective on a commercial scale. On the other hand, MEMS sensors are very cheap but cannot provide accurate attitude estimation for a moving vehicle as the sensor measurements are influenced by the kinematic motion of the vehicle. Acceleration and braking corrupt the longitudinal sensor measurements and turning corrupts the lateral sensor measurements. In this paper, we formulate a Kalman filter which is able to compensate the external acceleration acting in the lateral direction using a gyroscope and odometery providing an accurate estimate of the vehicle's roll angle. A particle filter then uses this roll angle estimate along with a pre-determined terrain map of the driving region to localize the vehicle. Experimental results performed on an instrumented test vehicle show that the corrected roll measurements from MEMS IMU data using the proposed Kalman filter can localize a land vehicle very accurately."
3020794,20178,369,"A Primer on Vehicle-to-Barrier Communications: Effects of Roadside Barriers, Encroachment, and Vehicle Braking",2016,"Today, more than half of the traffic fatalities are a result of run-off- road (RoR) crashes, which usually involve a single vehicle. Roadside barriers are often the last means to mitigate the severity of a RwD crashes into hazardous objects or features. While the recent research on vehicular communications primarily focus on safety related wireless communications for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I) scenarios, the interactions between vehicles and barriers in next-generation vehicular systems have not been well- studied. In this paper, vehicle-to-barrier (V2B) wireless communication paradigm is introduced as a potential missing link in preventing single-vehicle RoR fatalities. V2B communications, which take place between vehicles and radios embedded in roadside barriers can contribute to keeping cars on the road and help mitigate RwD crashes. The realization of V2B communication services necessitates an in-depth understanding of the underlying physical characteristics of the environment and channel. To this end, in this paper, some of the first real world field test measurement results of V2B communications are presented. More specifically, the effects of two types of commonly-utilized barriers (rigid concrete barrier and corrugated-beam guardrail) on the V2B channel communications are illustrated. The results show that guardrail barriers exhibit a waveguiding effect on signal transmission, while higher signal attenuation is observed with rigid barriers. Moreover, experiments illustrate the characteristics of V2B orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication during vehicle encroachment and braking. The results highlight the adverse effects of vehicle braking on OFDM signal transmission in terms of received signal strength, peak to average power ratio, and error vector magnitude."

Meta-heuristics can be an adequate approach to solve this problem with a mild computational effort. In this work, different meta-heuristics are implemented and applied to this problem, with Differential Evolution presenting promising connection setup time results that expectedly would enable its use in m-MIMO systems."
2863591,20178,369,Enhanced Position Verification for VANETs Using Subjective Logic,2016,"The integrity of messages in vehicular ad-hoc networks has been extensively studied by the research community, resulting in the IEEE&#126;1609.2 standard, which provides typical integrity guarantees. However, the correctness of message contents is still one of the main challenges of applying dependable and secure vehicular ad-hoc networks. One important use case is the validity of position information contained in messages: position verification mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide this functionality. A more general approach to validate such information is by applying misbehavior detection mechanisms. In this paper, we consider misbehavior detection by enhancing two position verification mechanisms and fusing their results in a generalized framework using subjective logic. We conduct extensive simulations using VEINS to study the impact of traffic density, as well as several types of attackers and fractions of attackers on our mechanisms. The obtained results show the proposed framework can validate position information as effectively as existing approaches in the literature, without tailoring the framework specifically for this use case."
3020709,20178,369,Proactive Cognitive Networks with Predictable Demand,2016,"In this paper we characterize the proactive diversity gain of a cognitive network with predictable primary and secondary requests. Network performance is analyzed under two proposed proactive service policies that preserve higher priority for the primary user. The first policy preserves the primary diversity bound as if there is no secondary user in the network, whereas the second policy boosts the secondary diversity with guaranteed higher primary diversity. For each policy, we derive diversity gain bounds for primary and secondary users. We show that the predictability of secondary requests can remarkably boost quality of service (QoS) of the secondary user compared to the previous literature when secondary requests are nonpredictable. We provide numerical simulations to validate our analytical findings and demonstrate performance merits."
3020926,20178,369,Use of the Recursive Least Squares Filter for Self Interference Channel Estimation,2016,"This paper presents the use of recursive least squares for online estimation of the self interference channel for an In Band Full Duplex communications link without the use of half duplex pilot signals. By using a long effective filter length it is possible to overcome the extra interference of the receieved signal, and it proves to be an effective way to estimate the channel in all scenarios, but it provides the greatest efficiency gain over current methods with a short channel coherence time. Recursive least squares estimation provides a way to take advantage of the constant knowledge of the transmitted signal to track the channel while consuming relatively few computational resources. Introducing online RLS estimation for In-Band Full Duplex communication provides a way to take advantage of the self interference cancellation gains from digital cancellation without introducing additional protocol overhead to the transmissions."
3007826,20178,369,Scheduling in D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks with Deadline Constraints,2016,"In this paper, we develop a scheduling algorithm for device-to-device (D2D) cellular networks with deadline constraints via the convex delay cost approach. At the beginning of each time slot, the algorithm allocates all available channels to the users, and each user can choose to transmit in different modes. After characterizing the transmission rates and defining the utility for each possible scheduling decision, we propose power optimization algorithms to maximize the utility for each type of decision. Our scheduling algorithm allocates each channel according to the decision that provides the maximum utility value, and it manages mode selection, channel allocation and power optimization. Via simulation results, we discuss the parameter selection for our algorithm and verify the performance improvements by allowing D2D users to share channels with other users."
3030987,20178,369,Noise Estimation for Spectrum Sensing Schemes,2016,"In this paper, a noise estimation method is proposed and examined for spectrum sensing purposes. The proposed method is based on the use of the first Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF), which is the output of the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This technique is blind and a priori knowledge of the received signal characteristics are not required. Two well known noise-dependent spectrum sensing techniques, namely Energy Detector (ED) and Maximum Eigenvalue Detector (MED), are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The simulated results show an improvement in the detection rate for both techniques, ED and MED, in contrast with scenarios with noise uncertainty."
2991522,20178,369,Theoretical Shannon Capacity Performance of Nonlinearly Amplified Uplink OFDMA Signals in the Presence of Terminal Mobility,2016,"This paper proposes the theoretical derivation method of the Shannon capacity for nonlinearly amplified uplink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in the presence of terminal mobility. In our theoretical derivation, the impact of the intercarrier interference (ICI) arising from terminal mobility as well as the multiuser interference (MUI) caused by nonlinear amplification of the mobile stations (MSs) on OFDMA signals is taken into account. Considering the fact that these interferences differ with the sub-carrier allocation methods such as localized FDMA (LFDMA) and interleaved FDMA (IFDMA), we derive the probability density function (PDF) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise-plus-distortion-plus-interference ratio (SNDIR) for each sub-carrier allocation method. Since the SNDIR is successfully expressed in the closed form, the proposed formula enables us to evaluate the Shannon capacity without conducting time consuming computer simulations."

We use the coefficient of variation of three spatial properties of point processes to measure the regularity of two common types of PTL: uniform on disc and Gaussian. From these measurements, we are able to derive a simple formula that allows matching and interchanging the two PTL models, within about 0.1 dB error in SIR."
3040822,20178,369,D2D Neighbor Discovery and Resource Scheduling through Demodulation Reference Signal,2016,"3GPP has recently accelerated the standardization process for Device-to-Device communications. Sidelink, which refers to the radio link between two user equipments (UEs), is a major update in 3GPP Release 12. In this paper, we will first introduce sidelink related structures and procedures in Release 12. Based on basic LTE signaling schemes, we propose methods of using demodulation reference signal (DMRS), which is used as reference signal in both uplink and sidelink, for advance D2D neighbor discovery and resource scheduling of D2D transmissions. Our study shows that reference signal of normal LTE channels can be well exploited to facilitate the newly proposed sidelink communications."
3002145,20178,369,Mean Spectral Radius Detection for Cognitive Radio,2016,"In this paper, a new spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed based on the eigenvalue distribution of the covariance matrix of sensing nodes. The received signals of all the nodes can be denoted by a non- Hermitian random matrix. A recent research indicates that the eigenvalue distribution for the product of non-Hermitian random matrices follows Single Ring Theorem for the noise-only case. However, for the signal-present case, the inner radius of the eigenvalue distribution is smaller than that of the noise-only case. Then mean spectral radius (MSR) can be utilized to detect the signal. The proposed method overcomes the noise uncertainty and has higher detection performance than the maximum- minimum eigenvalue (MME) detection when the primary signals among sensing nodes are uncorrelated. Finally, Simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
3020701,20178,369,Experimental Verification of Spectrum Superposing in Two Different Systems by Blind Adaptive Array with Subcarrier Transmission Power Assignment,2016,"We previously proposed blind adaptive array (BAA) with subcarrier transmission power assignment (STPA) that enables spectrum superposing without any channel state information. This paper experimentally validates the basic feasibility of the proposed scheme using fabricated prototype; interference suppression performance of the proposed system with STPA-BAA and its interference reduction performance to the conventional system. Exploiting characteristics of constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and power inversion (PI), the transmitter of the proposed system provides two levels of power density for each subcarrier: high and low level. The receiver then uses CMA or PI to appropriately suppress interference on each subcarrier. Low-level subcarrier by the proposed system is also effective in reducing interference to the conventional system which has no interference suppression function. This paper conducts indoor experiments by wired setup of spectrum superposition in two multicarrier systems. Though the practical performance of STPA-BAA is limited due to the quantization level or dynamic range of the transceiver, effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed. Improved operational SIR range of the proposed and the conventional system are presented."

Based on the conventional pilot design used in the intra-cell, we design the pilots which can make the power of inter-cell interference distribute in all paths of the channel uniformly, and result in a variation coefficient of zero, then the better performance on system level will be derived. The properties of these pilots are described, and the simulation results are presented."
