2272818,21212,9856,Reliable telemetry in white spaces using remote attestation,2011,"We consider reliable telemetry in white spaces in the form of protecting the integrity of distributed spectrum measurements against coordinated misreporting attacks. Our focus is on the case where a subset of the sensors can be remotely attested. We propose a practical framework for using statistical sequential estimation coupled with machine learning classifiers to deter attacks and achieve quantifiably precise outcome. We provide an application-oriented case study in the context of spectrum measurements in the white spaces. The study includes a cost analysis for remote attestation, as well as an evaluation using real transmitter and terrain data from the FCC and NASA for Southwest Pennsylvania. The results show that with as low as 15% penetration of attestation-capable nodes, more than 94% of the attempts from omniscient attackers can be thwarted."
2953439,21212,8228,Remote control of base station antenna systems based on two-dimensional electrically adjustable technology,2012,"The adjustments of vertical angle and horizontal azimuth angle of base station antenna are the most frequent and most enormous workload in the operation and maintenance of base station. Based on two-dimensional electrically adjustable technology, RCU with AISG2.0 protocol can remote control vertical beam and horizontal coverage area of the entire base station network. With the automated optimization software, the rational allocation of each base station antenna can be done smartly. Compared with the traditional base station systems, this one has the advantages such as smart remote to adjust, the two-dimensional electrical adjustment, and work around the clock."
892438,21212,369,Collision-Balancing Frequency Hopping in Single-Hop Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,2012,"We consider a single-hop frequency hopping (FH) mobile ad hoc network (MANET). To increase throughput orthogonal FH (O-FH) with hop-synchronous hopping can be used, thereby allowing collision-free transmissions under certain circumstances. However, as the MANET grows, hopping sequences must be re-used. As a result, nodes sharing the same sequence will experience deterministic collisions while others having a unique sequence will still communicate collision-free. This results in an \emph{unfair} interference situation and makes performance guarantees difficult to meet for all nodes simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a \emph{collision-balancing} FH (CB-FH) scheme to overcome this drawback. The CB scheme builds on O-FH and adapts the sequence set to balance interference among the nodes. We analytically study the characteristics of the adaptive sequences and analyze the resulting interference situation at the nodes. The performance is compared to uncoordinated FH (U-FH) and O-FH. It is found that CB-FH solves the problem of unfairness present in O-FH. Compared to U-FH, CB-FH yields considerable improvements in a wide range. Practical issues are discussed."

Different from most of the papers that appeared on this topic, here the impact of collisions on the performance provided by several LA solutions is assessed through accurate simulations. Two original LA solutions are also suggested, which outperform previously proposed strategies"
1995150,21212,369,Iterative (TURBO) IQ Imbalance Estimation and Correction in BICM-ID for Flat Fading Channels,2007,"TURBO principle has been exploited gainfully to implement many receiver functions. RF front-end impairments are a serious issue in high spectral efficient applications. IQ imbalance is one of these impairments and in this work, we study the issue of IQ imbalance correction using baseband signal processing techniques. In particular, we propose an estimation technique based on EM algorithm. Such a technique is developed rather intuitively for the case of a Bit Interleaved Coded modulation - Iterative Detection (BICM-ID) receiver for burst mode communications. The resulting TURBO IQ Decorrelator is embedded in the BICM-ID loop, is blind in the sense that it does not require any training symbols or tones. Performance is simulated for 64QAM under flat fading channel conditions."

Simulation results show that this method provides a good throughput performance, and it can be generalized for other application cases easily."
1989290,21212,369,VoIP and Tracking Capacity over WiFi Networks,2011,"Wireless VoIP is becoming an increasingly important application in recent years. This fact, coupled with the increasing interest in location based services, strongly suggest that tracking of wireless VoIP clients will become a widely deployed feature in emerging wireless applications. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of WiFi networks carrying VoIP and tracking sessions for our novel architectures developed specifically to support such applications. We first present an upper bound on a maximum number of users who can be supported by the proposed architecture for tracking only applications via simulations and experiments. We then vary the transmission frequency of tracking data and observe that it has a significant impact on the tracking capacity. Finally, we utilize one of our other locations tracking architecture that is designed for wireless VoIP to investigate how the transmission frequency affects the capacity of combined VoIP and tracking sessions. We develop an insight that at high packetization intervals (e.g. 60 ms) of VoIP traffic, there is a 30% decrease in combined VoIP and tracking capacity in comparison to VoIP only capacity. We further evaluate the capacity of proposed architecture using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) in the presence of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) traffic. Our studies suggest that compared to UDP, DCCP not only improves the combined VoIP and tracking capacity but also enables TCP to get a reasonable bandwidth share."
2300678,21212,369,Optimal Number of Secondary Users through Maximizing Utility in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing,2009,"Spectrum sensing is a key technology in Cognitive Radio (CR) and cooperative spectrum sensing is derived due to the effects of channel fading. In this paper, we focus on the optimal number of secondary users in cooperative spectrum sensing to maximize the utility in CR network. By considering both the detection error probability and the resource used by the secondary users in cooperation, we derive the analytical suboptimal number of secondary users in a special CR network where all the SUs have the same SNR. The simulation results show that the utility of suboptimal scheme is greater than that of other schemes and nearly the same as that of the optimal scheme with exhaust search. causes interference to the PU. Also, each SU in the cooperation should pay for the resource used in the process of detection such as sensing power and bandwidth in report to fusion center. We define the utility of the network with consideration of all the above aspects. Then we present the problem of selecting the number of SUs to maximize the utility in a special CR network with all SUs having the same SNR. It is found hard to get an analytical result because the equation is a transcendental equation. So we derive an approximate analytical result by ignoring the cost of the resource in the cooperation. The simulation results show that the utility of the suboptimal analytical results is nearly the same as that of the optimal results with exhaust research. Moreover, the utility of the suboptimal result is greater than other schemes even its detection performance is not optimal."
2440335,21212,369,Introduction of an Analytical Figure of Merit for Quality of Service Measurement,2006,"Investigations performed for future applications in various research areas allow users to communicate over more than one radio access technology with one single device. Thus, user terminals need methods to specify the quality of service provided by a radio access technology in order to decide about the radio access technology being used for a certain service or even to consider a possible change of an operator. In this paper a quality of service measure is proposed that allows the evaluation of services by certain service parameters, as, for example, a data transmission may be judged by the bit error rate, the overall network data rate or the delay. The measure defined in this paper bases on simple observation of frames resp. packets and can be applied for the assessment of any service property whose validity can be characterized by a simple decision whether or not a given quality of service was fulfilled."
1794189,21212,369,Energy Efficient Timing Synchronizer for MB-OFDM UWB,2011,"A cross-correlation function (CCF) based timing synchronization algorithm of low complexity, applicable for single-band transmission is presented. Novelty of the synchronizer lies in utilization of specific preamble structure of the Multi-band OFDM frame format. This threshold based algorithm also takes care of the fact that stronger multipath components frequently appear on the later clusters. Performance of the algorithm is measured in terms of mean-squared-error and synchronization probability. Performance is compared with another single-band based timing algorithm by Yak et al. [2]. The probability of correct detection is analyzed mathematically to verify the experimental results."
1842363,21212,369,Linear Precoders for Parallel Gaussian Channels with Low Decoding Complexity,2011,"Consider the transmission of complex-valued symbols over $N$ parallell channels in additive white Gaussian noise. It is well known that linear precoding of the complex-valued data improves system performance (e.g. symbol error rate, information rate, MMSE, etc.) at a cost of increased decoding complexity at the receiver. This work constructs precoders that are constrained to have a decoding complexity which equals that of no precoding, while still improving the system performance significantly compared with the no precoding case. This is achieved by designing the precoder so that it precodes the complex data streams separately, by utilizing the latest result from optimal real-valued precoding, and transmitting the real and complex parts of one symbol over different antennas."
1887356,21212,369,Joint Detection and CFO Compensation in Asynchronous Multi-User MIMO OFDM Systems,2009,"It is well known that carrier frequency offsets caused by inaccuracies of local oscillators between transmitter and receiver stations destroy the orthogonality among OFDM subcarriers and induce additional intercarrier interference. In conjunction with MIMO transmission where different users interfere with each other, this effect strongly degrades the signal detection performance if it is not compensated beforehand. In the uplink of multi-user systems different CFOs between all mobile terminals occur whereas its correction is more difficult. In this paper we consider the uplink of a fully asynchronous system with different transmitter and receiver CFOs which appears in distributed MIMO systems with separate users and base stations. We describe a combined scheme for joint CFO correction and spatial layer detection in frequency domain. The detection performance is shown for some selected equaliser concepts. In this way we present interference cancellation algorithms with low and scalable complexity. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided to compare the detection performance."
1388920,21212,369,Moment-based and Maximum Likelihood-based Quotiential estimation of the Nakagami-m fading parameter,2007,"In order to estimate m-parameter of Nakagami-m multipath fading, different estimation models have been proposed and simulated, and their performances have already been compared. In this paper, we propose new method for estimation of m-parameter, which is not based on estimation from signal envelope samples, but on quotient of successive samples. For that purpose, analytical model which describes statistics of successive samples quotients has been developed. Two models have been treated, these are moment based method (MM) and maximum likelihood method (MLM). Numerical simulations will demonstrate performances of proposed methods and will compare them with some known methods in cases of presence and absence of shadow fading with arbitrary distribution."
1098819,21212,369,Adaptive Predistortion Techniques for Non-Linearly Amplified FBMC-OQAM Signals,2014,"The Filter Bank Multicarrier with Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (FBMC-OQAM) is emerging as one of the alternatives to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for next generation broadband wireless access systems. In this paper, we focus on the nonlinear distortion effects in a FBMC-OQAM system when the signal is passed through a nonlinear High Power Amplifier (HPA) which is modeled as Saleh's one exhibiting amplitude and phase distortions. First, we develop an analysis showing that the FBMC-OQAM signals are more sensitive to the phase distortion than OFDM signals. Then, we address the problem of the compensation of these distortions in FBMC-OQAM systems using digital predistortion (DPD) at the transmitter. Therefore, two DPD schemes are considered in this investigation and their performance are compared in OFDM and FBMC-OQAM systems."
1459393,21212,369,Energy Efficiency Analysis of Soft and Hard Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks,2014,"Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) represents a key factor in the success of cognitive radio networks. CSS implies that users report their local sensing results to a fusion center in order to process them. The two popular reporting schemes are soft and hard schemes. In hard scheme, local sensing result is conveyed by a single bit, whereas the sensing result is reported as it is in the soft scheme. The more detection accuracy attained by soft scheme is confronted by more resource efficiency in hard scheme. This paper provides analytic comparison between both schemes in terms of throughput, energy consumption and energy efficiency. Our work includes deriving the sufficient conditions on the frame length by which the hard scheme outperforms soft scheme for each comparison aspect. Our results show that hard scheme always achieves higher throughput, while, at short frames and large number of users, it consumes less energy and attains higher energy efficiency."
2381893,21212,369,Enhanced Lattice-Reduction-Based Precoder with List Quantizer in Broadcast Channel,2007,"In the multiple-antenna broadcast channel, each user is not allowed to cooperate with other users, so the efficient and well-designed preceding scheme to reduce other users' interferences is required. Recently, the use of lattice basis reduction(LR) has been shown to be a very effective method for preceding in multiuser multiple antenna systems. Lattice basis reduction helps to reduce the average transmitted energy by modifying the region which includes the constellation points. Even though the LR precoding method achieves a full diversity order, the performance loss caused by quantization error still remains. In this paper, we propose a simple precoding technique to reduce the quantization error. The proposed scheme establishes a lattice list to provide more candidates for transmission power reduction based on the analysis of the patterns of the error. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the BER performance as good as that of more complex precedents (such as the vector perturbation using sphere-encoding) with significant saving in complexity.remains."
2447030,21212,369,Dynamic Carrier Allocation for Cognitive Radio Networks,2011,"Cognitive radios have been introduced as a dynamic way to share the frequency spectrum within wireless networks. After sensing its environment to discover the available frequency resources, a cognitive network allocates the locally available carriers among its nodes, under the constraint of negligible interference on licensed operators. The allocation, based on partial knowledge of the network parameters, must be optimized in order to provide maximum rates in the cognitive network. In addition, having a stable allocation reduces the control traffic inherent in dynamic networks. This paper presents a new and fast iterative way to allocate the available carriers, that reduces the control traffic and provides fairness at the same time. Using the properties of a proportionally fair objective function, we fasten the optimum search in the space of possible allocations, and reach that optimum with no approximation. Numerical results show that the proposed iterative algorithm is less complex than an analytical solution in usual dynamic carrier allocation scenarios."
2245874,21212,369,Throughput Enhancement of IEEE 802.11e WLAN by Transmission Power Randomization,2011,"In this paper, we evaluate the effect of power randomization on the saturation throughput of a WLAN comprised of four classes of users, corresponding to four access categories (ACs) of IEEE 802.11e EDCA. To this end, we consider a specific number of power levels for all users. By some simplifications, we find the probability distributions for the power levels at each class in order to optimize the saturation throughput of a specific class. We evaluate the effect of such optimization onto the saturation throughput of other ACs as well as the saturation throughput of the whole network. Finally, we present some numerical results to show the effect of our optimization in different conditions."
1092068,21212,369,Scatternet Formation for IEEE 802.15.3 WPANs,2006,"In this paper, we consider the unique properties of the scatternet formation problem for IEEE 802.15.3 wireless personal area networks and formulate it as a set covering problem. We propose a fully distributed stochastic scatternet formation algorithm and compare its performance against a greedy algorithm and idealized best/worst case scenarios. The stochastic algorithm avoids using weight information and hence saves the cost of message exchange incurred in other clustering algorithms while achieving better connectivity and requiring less maintenance. Simulation results show that the stochastic algorithm results in only 20% more piconets than the ideal but impracticable greedy algorithm, and the resulting scatternet topology scales well with network size and is robust and stable."
2421273,21212,369,On the Detection of Unknown Signals Using Welch Overlapped Segmented Averaging Method,2011,"In this paper, the problem of spectrum sensing for cognitive radios is investigated when the decision statistic is computed using Welch Overlapped Segmented Averaging (WOSA). A novel analysis is presented using the performance measures which are the probability of false alarm and the probability of detection. First, we present a novel investigation of the hermitian form of Welch's estimate. Using the theory of quadratic forms, we investigate the hermitian matrix of the hermitian form and exploit its characteristics to obtain the eigenvalues of the diagonalized representation of the hermitian form. Second, the obtained results are used to derive mathematical expressions for the probabilities of false alarm and detection over Rayleigh fading. The numerical results have revealed the high accuracy of the obtained mathematical models."
2873115,21212,369,Weighted Sum Rate Maximization of Correlated MISO Interference Broadcast Channels under Linear Precoding: A Large System Analysis,2016,"The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximizing linear precoder algorithm is studied in large correlated multiple-input single output (MISO) interference broadcast channels (IBC). We consider an iterative WSR design which exploits the connection with Weighted sum Minimum Mean Squared Error (WMMSE) designs as in [1], [2] and [3], focusing on the version in [1]. We propose an asymptotic approximation of the signal- tointerference plus noise ratio (SINR) at every iteration. We also propose asymptotic approximations for Matched Filter (MF) precoders. Simulations show that the approximations are accurate, especially when the channels are correlated."

We utilize cross entropy (CE) optimization techniques together with convex optimization to design training sequence that minimizes the channel estimate mean squared error (MSE) as well as estimating the effect of I/Q mismatch while lowering the peak power of the training signals. The proposed design provide better channel estimate MSE and bit error rate (BER) performances. The efficacies of the proposed designs are corroborated by analysis and simulation results."

892911,21212,339,Blind Transmitter Authentication for Spectrum Security and Enforcement,2014,"Recent advances in spectrum access technologies, such as cognitive radios, have made spectrum sharing a viable option for addressing the spectrum shortage problem. However, these advances have also contributed to the increased possibility of hacked or rogue radios causing harm to the spectrum sharing ecosystem by causing significant interference to other wireless devices. One approach for countering such threats is to employ a scheme that can be used by a regulatory entity (e.g., FCC) to uniquely identify a transmitter by authenticating its waveform. This enables the regulatory entity to collect solid evidence of rogue transmissions that can be used later during an adjudication process. We coin the term Blind Transmitter Authentication (BTA) to refer to this approach. Unlike in the existing techniques for PHY-layer authentication, in BTA, the entity that is authenticating the waveform is not the intended receiver. Hence, it has to extract and decode the authentication signal blindly with little or no knowledge of the transmission parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel BTA scheme called Frequency offset Embedding for Authenticating Transmitters (FEAT). FEAT embeds the authentication information into the transmitted waveform by inserting an intentional frequency offset. Our results indicate that FEAT is a practically viable approach and is very robust to harsh channel conditions. Our evaluation of FEAT is based on theoretical bounds, simulations, and indoor experiments using an actual implementation."

In this paper, UL CoMP for HSPA networks is considered. UL CoMP for HSPA may be deployed without changes to the standard, and may be applied also for legacy UEs. Comparisons and contrasts of CoMP with conventional soft/soft handover are discussed as well as practical receiver structures incorporating antenna selection within the pool of antennas available in a CoMP cell. Radio resource management issues are discussed including mobility, power control, load control, and scheduling. It is concluded that UL CoMP requires only minimal changes to these algorithms. In a practical scenario, gains in cell-edge throughput of at least 118% and 144% are demonstrated for CoMP-3 and CoMP-6, respectively, for the case of full buffer traffic. The gains are even larger for the case of short files uploads where the conventional network suffers from the inability to exploit soft/softer handover due to latencies involved in updating a UE's active set."

IntroductionAccording to a survey conducted by International Telecom-munication Union (ITU) in 2003, more than 2.5 billion people(which is 40% of the total population) still live in remoteand rural areas with limited communication access [1]. Worsemore, electricity supply in most rural areas is always insuﬃ-cient or even non-existent. Therefore, how to power the BSs inrural areas is a challenging issue facing developing countriesand even the world.To address this challenge, energy harvesting has been in-troduced into communication industry as the power source ofBSs in rural areas. Now BSs that harvest renewable energy,such as solar and wind, are gradually deployed in some ruralareas throughout the world. For instance, China Mobile hadestablished the world’s largest solar energy BS cluster inTibet [2]. Moreover, among the 1000+BSs in Tibet, about80% of them are powered by solar energy. This reveals thepotential of energy harvesting techniques to be applied in ruralcommunications and future’s green communications.If the traﬃc has no large variations, energy output of BSsshould be stable to guarantee high QoS and high energyeﬃciency. In this work, we consider that BSs only use theharvested energy and have no alternative energy source toback up. In this case, the prediction of future energy arrivalsis important, since it can balance the energy storage andenergy output in the temporal domain. More accurately, traﬃcmodeling will be considered in our future work, such thatenergy output matches the traﬃc. Notably, when the batterycapacity is large enough, we can use a constant energy outputrate that equals to the average energy input rate. However,batteries with very large capacity increase the deployment costdramatically. Therefore, with limited battery capacity, goodenergy allocation algorithms are needed to best allocate theharvested energy.In this paper, we only consider BSs equipped with solarpanel. Solar energy models have been systematically studiedby geographers and meteorologists since 1970s. However,most models are too complex to be applied, and not allof the parameters are always available. For instance, in themodel contributed by [3]–[6], air pressure, temperature, watervapor, oxygen, ozone, aerosol and spectrum are all included.Therefore, our work begins by presenting a simple and generalsolar energy model.For resource scheduling in energy harvesting communica-tions, much work has been done either in diﬀerent scenarios, orwith diﬀerent targets, or in diﬀerent methods. For instance, [7]proposes energy-neural mode that can use as much energy aspossible from the environment in sensor networks. [8] presentsoptimal energy management schemes in energy harvestingsystems with fading channels to maximize the number of bitssent within a deadline. Moreover, the duration that all thepackets are delivered is minimized by changing transmissionrate according to traﬃc load and available energy in [9], andthe short-term throughput is maximized for a link with anenergy harvesting transmitter in [10]. However, most of thework just assumes random energy arrivals and doesn’t takeinto account the energy arrival prediction, which will be solvedin our work.The main contributions of this work are:"
1323252,21212,8228,Is backhaul becoming a bottleneck for green wireless access networks,2014,"Wireless access networks today consume 0.5 percent of the global energy. Rapidly growing demand for new services and ubiqutious connectivity, will further increase the energy consumption. This situation imposes a big challenge for mobile operators not only due to soaring cost of energy, but also increasing concern for global warming and sustainable development.This thesis focuses on the energy efficiency issue at the system level and studies how to incorporate energy-awareness into the design of future wireless access networks. The main contributions have been given in the areas of energy efficiency assessment, architectural and operational solutions, and total cost of investment analysis.The precise evaluation of energy efficiency is the first essential step to determine optimized solutions where metrics and models constitute the two key elements.We show that maximizing energy efficiency is not always equivalent to minimizing energy consumption which is one of the main reasons behind the presented contradictory and disputable conclusions in the literature. Further we indicate that in order to avoid the debatable directions, energy efficient network design problems should be formulated with well defined coverage and capacity requirements. Moreover, we propose novel backhaul power consumption models considering various technology and architectural options relevant for urban and rural environments and show that backhaul will potentially become a bottleneck in future ultra-high capacity wireless access networks.Second, we focus on clean-slate network deployment solutions satisfying different quality of service requirements in a more energy efficient manner. We identify that the ratio between idle- and transmit power dependent power consumption of a base station as well as the network capacity requirement are the two key parameters that affect the energy-optimum design.While results show that macro cellular systems are the most energy efficient solution for moderate average traffic density, Hetnet solutions prevail homogeneous deployment due to their ability to increase the capacity with a relatively lower energy consumption and thus enable significant energy savings in medium and high capacity demand regions.Moreover, we investigate the energy saving potential of short-term energy aware management approach, i.e., cell DTX, taking advantage of low resource utilization in the current networks arising from strict QoS requirements. With the help of developed novel quantitative method, we show that Cell DTX brings striking reduction in energy consumption and further savings are achievable if the networks are designed taking into account the fact that network deployment and operation are closely related.Finally, we develop a general framework for investigating the main cost elements and for evaluating the viability of energy efficient solutions.We first reveal the strong positive impact of spectrum on both energy and infrastructure cost and further indicate that applying sustainable solutions might also bring total cost reduction, but the viability highly depends on unit cost values as well as the indirect cost benefits of energy efficiency.Results obtained in this dissertation might provide guidelines for the network designers to achieve future high-capacity and sustainable wireless access networks."
1145556,21212,8228,Cost modeling of backhaul for mobile networks,2014,"“Connected society” where everything and everyone are connected at any time and on any location brings new challenges for the network operators. This leads to the need of upgrading the transport networks as the segment of Internet infrastructure connecting the fixed users and mobile base stations to the core/aggregation in order to provide high sustainable bandwidth, as well as supporting a massive number of connected devices. To do this, operators need to change the way that access networks are currently deployed. The future access network technologies will need to support very high capacity and very long distances, which are the inherited characteristics of optical transmission. Hence, optical fiber technology is recognized as the only future proof technology for broadband access.Capacity upgrade in the access networks can lead to a huge capacity demand in the backbone network. One promising solution to address this problem, is to keep the local traffic close to the end users as much as possible, and prevent unnecessary propagation of this type of traffic through the backbone. In this way, operators would be able to expand their access network without the significant capacity upgrade in the higher aggregation layers. Motivated by this need, a comprehensive evaluation of optical access networks is carried out in this thesis regarding ability of accommodating local traffic and amount of possible saving in the backbone by implementing locality awareness schemes.Meanwhile, next generation optical access (NGOA) networks have to provide high capacity at low cost while fulfilling the increasing reliability requirements of future services and customers. Therefore, finding cost-efficient and reliable alternative for future broadband access is one of the most important contributions of this thesis. We analyzed the tradeoff between the cost needed to deploy backup resources and the reliability performance improvement obtained by the proposed protection mechanism.Among different NGOA architectures, hybrid time and wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (TWDM PON) is considered as a proper candidate providing high capacity and large coverage. Therefore, this approach is further analyzed and several tailored protection schemes with high flexibility are proposed to statisfy different requirements from the residential and business users in the same PON. The work carried out in the thesis has proved that TWDM PON can also offer high reliability performance while keeping the network expenditures at an acceptable level. Considering some other advantages such as low power consumption and high flexibility in resource allocation of this architecture, it has high potential to be the best candidate for NGOA networks. Moreover, new deployments of radio access networks supporting the increasing capacity demand of mobile users lead to the upgrade of the backhaul segment as a part of broadband access infrastructure. Hence, this thesis also contributes with a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation methodology for mobile backhaul. Several technologies are investigated in order to find the most cost-efficient solution for backhauling the high capacity mobile networks. Finally, a PON-based mobile backhaul with high capacity and low latency has been proposed for handling coordinated multipoint transmission systems in order to achieve high quality of experience for mobile users."
1951675,21212,369,Low Complexity FFT Based Spectrum Sensing in Bluetooth System,2009,"In this paper, we propose a complexity reduced spectrum sensing technique for Bluetooth to find channels free from the use of other communication devices in 2.4 GHz ISM band. By exploiting the spectrum characteristics of interference sources, the proposed scheme detects the availability of chan- nels by comparing the power spectrum density (PSD) with a threshold. To reduce the implementation complexity, the PSD is calculated by means of fast Fourier transform and linear interpolation. The threshold for the detection is determined to maximize the detection probability. To further improve the trans- mission performance, the proposed scheme dynamically changes the channels by measuring the transmission performance. I. INTRODUCTION source nearby by measuring the PER. Adaptive control action mitigates interference sources based on the channel classifica- tion result. The AFH can outperform the RFH by only utilizing channels in good condition. However, it is required to blindly transmit packets for the channel classification, causing possible packet loss and PER performance degradation. Problems with the use of conventional RFH and AFH techniques can be alleviated by means of efficient spectrum sensing. The spectrum sensing is often achieved by three detection techniques: energy detection, matched filter coherent detection, and cyclo-stationary feature detection (7). Since non-coherent energy detection is simple and is able to quickly locate the spectrum occupancy information, it is widely used for the spectrum sensing. Previous works considered the en- ergy detection by cooperating among multiple radios (8), (9), but they can be applied to the detection of signals in a single channel. The signal detection in multiple channels can be achieved by estimating the power spectrum density (PSD) of a wideband signal. The PSD of a wideband signal can be estimated by means of fast Fourier transform (FFT). The existence of interference was detected by approximating the PSD of each channel as a Gaussian model (10). However, it may take a long time to get a desired PSD from the FFT results. When applied to Bluetooth, it may need to perform FFT for all Bluetooth channels, resulting in huge computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a complexity reduced FFT based spectrum sensing scheme to detect the existence of WLAN signal. The proposed scheme performs the FFT exactly once only for selected channels to cope with rapidly varying wire- less channel environment. The PSD of other channels can be estimated by a simple linear interpolation technique. Since the proposed scheme performs the FFT only once, the PSD of each channel cannot be approximated as a Gaussian model. In the propose scheme, it is described by using a probability density function (pdf) of each channel condition (i.e., busy or idle). The threshold for the spectrum sensing is determined by a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion to maximize the detection probability. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system model in consideration. The proposed scheme for the mitigation of interference is described in Section III. Section IV verifies the performance of the proposed scheme by computer simulation. Finally, conclusions are given in Section V."
1848826,21212,8228,On the Comparison of Real-Time Rate Control Schemes for H.264/AVC Video Streams over IP-Based Networks Using Network Feedbacks,2011,"Abstract —Real-time rate control techniques are necessary to applications such as video streaming in order to adapt video sending rate to network conditions so that the perceived video quality is optimised. In this paper two real- time rate control schemes, are presented. The first one uses the currently available bandwidth in order to perform rate control by selecting the optimum QP (Quantization Parameter). The second rate control scheme is based on measurements of the current packet loss in order to select the optimum QP parameter. Through extensive simulations on a test-bed environment both schemes are studied under diverse network conditions and are compared against the commonly used Rate-Distortion optimization scheme, which is embedded on a video encoder. Keywords-real time video rate control, perceived video QoS optimization, PSNR I. I NTRODUCTION Advances in video coding standards, along with rapid developments and improvements of network infrastructures, storage capacity, and computing power are enabling an increasing number of video applications. Real time video networking over IP based wired and wireless networks are constantly becoming more popular and more demanding. Unlike previous coding standards (i.e. MPEG-1/2/4), H.264/AVC (standard jointly by ITU-T and ISO [1]) offers advanced features such as variable block sizes, multi-reference frames, improved coding efficient and better quality. Video Rate control is an important element in order to adapt video to the varying network conditions across heterogeneous wireless and wire-line networks. Rate control within the H.264 codec has been studied extensively in the literature [2], [3]. Rate control algorithms can be grouped in two major categories. The first category deals with the optimisation of Rate-Distortion at the encoder [4]-[6]. The second category deals with the determination of an optimum QP by taking into account rate-distortion and frame complexity [7], [8]. Many of these algorithms do not take into account the variation of network conditions. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance two new real time video rate control schemes that achieve maximum perceived video quality based on the currently available bandwidth (BW) and the measured packet loss, respectively. Unlike the previous methods, this paper proposes a rate control method in real-time where QP is determined by taking into account the network conditions. Two algorithms are examined. In particularly, the first rate control scheme considers current available BW that is estimated based on RTCP feedback from the user terminal. An entity named Rate Control Module (RCM) resided in the video encoder is responsible for selecting a new quantization parameter (QP) that can be used by the encoder and result in a higher perceived video quality (PSNR), as compared to the current one. The second rate-control scheme takes into account the current packet loss that is measured at the user terminal and is sent as a feedback to RCM via RTCP messages, periodically. This scheme maximizes perceived video quality by selecting a new QP that reduces the sending bit rate and at the same time minimizes the current packet loss. The performance of both schemes is compared against the standard method of rate-distortion optimisation (The encoder decides by itself about the QP parameter by taking as an input the available bandwidth). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II includes an analytical description of the proposed adaptation schemes. In Section III the test-bed environment is presented and the simulation results are discussed. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper. II. R"
1814231,21212,8228,Worst Case and Expected Peak-to-Average Power Ratio for Orthonormal Systems,2011,"We present several results that show, according to several criteria, that the large peaks that occur in OFDM are common to all orthonormal systems that are uniformly bounded. In particular, worst case peak-to-average values are always at least the square-root of the number of signals, and the expected peak value of a signal always increases logarithmically with the number of signals. The same growth also occurs for single-user signals with the appropriate normalization. Further, we investigate peak-to-average power properties of the prolate spheroidal wave functions and the Walsh functions, which are used in DS-CDMA. I. INTRODUCTION Large signal peak values are one of the main drawbacks of OFDM systems and, thus, their study is currently an area of much research. In this paper we show in a number of statements that the behavior seen in the OFDM system is common to all bounded orthonormal systems. This is true of typical single-user as well as multi-carrier systems. In fact, OFDM offers ideal performance by several measures, in that its behavior achieves the best possible. This is true for the worst-case deterministic peak as well as the expected value of the peaks. We show that analogous behavior occurs for the set of prolate spheroidal wave functions and for the Walsh functions, which are the signals used in DS-CDMA. These observations are timely since it is expected that 5G wireless systems will move from strict OFDM signals to other waveforms. We begin Section II by showing that the peak-values of single-user signals can grow logarithmically with the signal length. We then give several propositions that demonstrate that all orthonormal systems can lead to peak values of at least the same order as OFDM signals. We give several variations of this result. In the OFDM case, it is well-known that expected signal peaks grow logarithmically in the number of signals. We show that a powerful result from probability in Banach spaces yields the same behavior for all uniformly bounded orthonormal systems. This shows that there does not exist another orthonormal systems that immediately has a better peak value behavior than the OFDM system. In B. Farrell was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under Project BO 1734/18-1, and H. Boche was supported by a start-up fund of the Technische UniversitM¨ unchen. doing so, we hope to make a significant mathematical result with direct application to multi-carrier systems familiar to the communications community. In Section III we address peak value properties of the prolate spheroidal wave functions. There are two motivations for doing this. First, they are defined for long time intervals, and so it is valuable to determine if they have enough overlap among signals to lead to a high peak value. Secondly, these signals were used by Pollak, Slepian and Landau to prove Shannon's fundamental theorems of information theory. Proving that they have a strong peak growth then means that the approach taken by Pollak, Slepian and Landau would be insufficient if a peak value constraint were imposed. In Section IV we address the signals used in DS-CDMA, namely the Walsh functions. While the results of Section II apply to DS-CDMA, we show explicitly how peak values of the square-root of the number of signals can occur there. We use 'Theorem' to denote results cited from the mathematics literature and 'Lemma' or 'Proposition' for our results."
2129831,21212,369,Throughput-Based Antenna Selection Measurements,2009,"In this work, we provide a new throughput-based antenna selection criterion that considers the entire system design rather than only the channel state information. The performance evaluation was carried out in a measurement campaign in a common outdoor urban scenario. We present our results in terms of physical layer throughput over transmit power. In addition to diversity gains, we also see gains due to the selection of differently polarized antennas. In terms of SNR, the results show a gain of several decibels depending on the number of antennas selected. I. INTRODUCTION The utilization of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technologies is continuously growing due to the drastic in- crease in the channel capacity and the enormous improvement in the communication link reliability. Despite these advan- tages, MIMO has been slow in getting adopted in practical wireless systems. Currently, MIMO can be found as an option in High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), future modes of IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), and will be mandatory in next generation cellular systems. One of the main reasons for the slow introduction of MIMO technologies in commercial wireless systems is the required increment in complexity and hardware costs. While antenna elements are cheap and usually small, each one requires a complete radio frequency (RF) chain (low-noise amplifier, frequency down-converter, analog to digital converter, filters, and so on). Unfortunately, RF hardware is expensive compared to the cost of the the digital hardware and does not follow Moore's law (1). Also, introducing new hardware consumes more energy which is very inconvenient for today's hand-held mobile devices. Antenna subset selection (AS) is a promising technique that reduces the MIMO hardware complexity problem. AS adaptively chooses a specific subset of all available antennas, i.e., an Nt × Nr system can be constructed while only Lt × Lr complete RF chains are used at the same time (Lt <N t and Lr <N r). The antenna subset selection is based on a selection criterion depending on the application. It has been shown that under most circumstances, AS systems can achieve the same diversity gains as full-complexity systems. On the downside, AS suffers from a loss in array gain (mean SNR gain) but this loss can be avoided by preprocessing in the RF chain (2-6). A. State of the art"
2068693,21212,8228,The impact of source traffic distribution on quality of service (QoS) in ATM networks,2001,"A principal attraction of ATM networks is that the key QoS parameters of every call are guaranteed by the network when appropriate cell-level traffic controls are imposed at the user network interface (UNI) on a per call basis, utilizing the peak cell rate (PCR) and sustainable cell rate (SCR) values for the traffic sources. The issue of providing QoS guarantees in the real world, through traffic controls applied on a per call basis, is rendered uncertain. This paper adopts a radically different, high level approach to the issue of QoS guarantees. It aims at uncovering through systematic experimentation a relationship, if any exists, between the key high level user traffic characteristics and the resulting QoS measures in a realistic operational environment. Based on the observation that the network provider cares for two factors, namely, to maximize the link utilization and to ensure the QoS guarantees for every user traffic, this paper proposes a two-phase strategy. Under the first phase, the average link utilization computed over all the links in a network is maintained within a range, specified by the underlying network provider, through high level call admission control, i.e. by limiting the volume of the incident traffic on the network, at any time. The second phase is based on the hypothesis that the number of traffic sources, their nature-audio, video, or data, and the bandwidth distribution of the source traffic, admitted subject to a specific chosen value of link utilization in the network, will exert a unique influence on the cumulative delay distribution at the buffers of the representative nodes and, hence, on the QoS guarantees of each call. Extensive simulations reveal that, for a given link utilization level held uniform throughout the network, while the QoS metrics are superior in the presence of many calls each with low bandwidth requirement, they are significantly worse when the network carries fewer calls of very high bandwidths. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of guaranteeing QoS for each and every call through high level traffic controls. The findings also underscore two additional important contributions of this paper. First, the network provider may guide and maintain the network at a desired network operating point (NOP) by exercising control over the input and system parameters including link utilization, call admittance etc. Second, the finding constitutes a vulnerability of ATM networks which a perpetrator may exploit to launch a performance attack."
1830899,21212,369,Improved Spectrum Sensing by Utilizing Signal Autocorrelation,2009,"A method that exploits the autocorrelation of trans- mission signals for primary user detection in cognitive radio is proposed. A closed-form analysis of the method is presented and compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Analytical and simulation results indicate that the method provides significant improvement in the probability of detection for moderate SNR scenarios where fast sensing is required. Simulation results indicate the better performance in fading environment and collaborative sensing as well. I. INTRODUCTION Cognitive radio was suggested in (1) to realize a flexible and efficient usage of spectrum. An important component of cognitive radio is spectrum sensing to detect the presence or absence of a primary (licensed) user in the spectrum of inter- est. Some existing spectrum sensing techniques are matched filtering, waveform-based sensing (2), cyclostationarity-based sensing (3), (4), and energy detection (5)- (8). Matched filtering and waveform-based sensing can only be used for known signals, which may be unrealistic for cognitive radio. Energy detection is perhaps the most common method for detecting unknown signals. Recently, cyclostationarity-based sensing has gained significant attention due to better immunity to noise uncertainty, especially at very low SNR (4). Interest- ingly, at moderate SNR values, energy detection outperforms the cyclostationary method, suggesting that energy detection should be used for fast sensing above -18 dB SNR (4). In this paper we propose a new autocorrelation-based method (CorrSum method) and compare its performance with energy detection. The benefit of the new method lies in its ability to exploit the difference between the signal spectrum and noise spectrum over the sensing bandwidth, which arises due to higher autocorrelation of the signal. The use of prac- tical modulation schemes and the existence of RF channel guard bands tend to increase signal correlation. Also, certain primary systems are allocated much more bandwidth than the bandwidth they use to transmit symbols (e.g. radar), making the signal spectrum significantly different from flat spectrum of noise. Finally, partially occupied bands (e.g. in multichannel systems) exhibit large deviation in spectrum from that of noise. If the new CorrSum method is employed in such scenarios, significant performance improvement in sensing compared to energy detection can be achieved. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the problem of spectrum sensing and reviews energy detection method. Section III describes the proposed autocorrelation-based method (CorrSum method) for spectrum sensing along with closed-form analysis of its performance. Section IV gives some results comparing the CorrSum method with the energy detection method. Conclusion and some further works are discussed in Section V."
2011152,21212,8228,Analysis of Delay Statistics for the Queued-Code,2009,"Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in mobile wire- less networks are typically provided through queuing analysis, which uses an idealized model for the physical layer, leading to optimistic guarantees. A queued-code combines ideas from queuing theory and information/coding theory, to allow rate adaptation, while enabling accurate modeling of the physical layer. Previous work showed the benefit of using a queued-code, in achieving lower error probabilities while satisfying a fixed delay bound. This paper analyzes the queued-code when some function of delay statistics must be optimized while guaranteeing a fixed error probability. A practical implementation of queued-codes based on low density parity check (LDPC) convolutional codes is also presented. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the benefit of using the queued-code in obtaining a better QoS. Quality of Service (QoS) for delay sensitive applications is typically specified in terms of data rate, error rate and delay (e.g., absolute delay, mean delay, delay jitter). Guaranteeing QoS is especially challenging in wireless networks, where low reliability of wireless links, along with their time varying nature, may result in severe QoS violations. Traditionally, QoS guarantees have been through queuing analysis, which uses an abstract model for the physical layer, for tractability. This anal- ysis ignores the decoding errors and the encoding/decoding variance of delay, such that the probability of decoding error is bounded. The trade-off is made possible by the presence of the queue+server system in the transmitter, which allows for rate adaptation. We compare this system with another system which is typically used to reduce jitter, i.e., where the buffer (queue) is located at the receiver, instead of the transmitter. The buffer can again be used to minimize the delay variance for the same QoS requirements. However, the buffer can no longer use the feedback of CSI. Thus, this paper also evaluates the utility of having a buffer at the receiver versus at the transmitter, for delay sensitive applications. Finally, we present a practical queued-code based on low density parity check (LDPC) convolutional codes, which is inspired by the information theoretic queued-code. Several papers have explored trade-offs between average power/throughput and average delay (3), (4). Problems with constraint on absolute delay are considered in (3), (5). How- ever, each of these papers assumes that capacity achieving channel codes can be used. (6) presented an interesting com- bination of ideas from queuing theory and information theory to analyze mean delay in a multiaccess communication system. Section II presents the system model, and the problem setup. Section III presents the design and analysis of the queued- code when a fixed bound on probability of error is desired. The design of a queued-code based on LDPC convolutional codes is presented in Section IV. Some illustrative results, which show the benefit of using a queued-code, are presented in Section V. Simulation results for LDPC convolutional code based queued-codes are presented in Section VI. Section VII concludes the paper."
2192281,21212,8228,Algorithms for Constrained Bulk-Transfer of Delay-Tolerant Data,2010,"In recent years there has been renewed interest in the problem of transferring bulk data (terabytes) utilizing commercial ISPs. The need to transfer bulk data arises in various scientific and industrial applications. Today, this data is moved using postal service in conjunction with hard drives and DVDs or special high performance dedicated networks. The key insight underlying the recent work was that many of the applications are delay- tolerant and hence the bulk data can be transferred at minimal cost, utilizing already paid-for off-peak bandwidth resulting from diurnal traffic patterns, using store-and-forward through intermediate storage nodes. In this paper we expand on this theme and consider the computational complexity of transferring data over a network whose links have time-varying capacities. We show that the general problem of finding a cost-optimal transfer of the bulk data can be solved in polynomial-time using minimum cost flow algorithms on a time-expanded version of the underlying network. Our solution involves graph transformations. We present additional transformations that enable the handling of half-duplex links (e.g. fiber-optic links) as well as node processing constraints (e.g. limitations on the processing power available for filtering or archiving). An important characteristic of our solution is the ability to handle nodes with storage. We consider nodes with storage that varies over time in terms of both capacity and cost. We show that our approach provably extends to cover the case of linear costs, providing polynomial- time algorithms. However, the flat-fee storage model is NP- complete and hence unlikely to be tractable in polynomial-time. Interestingly, with constrained storage, the optimal solutions may involve loops, i.e. the data may pass through the same node more than once on its way from the destination to the source along the optimal route. We use data from one of the world's leading ISPs and perform a comprehensive evaluation of our algorithm. We show that there exists a huge potential for cost savings in real-world networks with time-varying costs for both link capacities and node storage."
2199431,21212,8228,Scalable multicast MPLS protocol for next generation broadband service convergence network,2004,"With explosive dissemination of broadband IP access services, like xDSL and FTTH, many service providers seek a chance for deploying new IP based broadband services networks for their customers. Among multiple candidates, content distribution (CD), interactive multi-media (IMM) and virtual private network (VPN) services are the most attractive broadband services for service provider and their customers. The quality of service (QoS) control and traffic engineering (TE) mechanism with strict reliability are essential functions to differentiate these services from conventional best effort IP access service and to make this broadband services network as a new communication infrastructure. Because MPLS already has all of these mechanisms in its protocol architecture, it is assumed that developing broadband IP service network by MPLS technology is the most promising way. But many of these services, such as video broadcasting, video conference and VPN multicast service require not only point-to-point (P2P) transmission capability but also point-to-multipoint (P2MP) transmission capability with much stricter QoS control, more sophisticated TE and more stable reliability control requirement. Therefore, P2MP capability extension is required to conventional MPLS. This paper proposes a scalable multicast MPLS protocol that can establish P2P and P2MP LSP simultaneously. The P2MP extension is realized on RSVP-TE (RFC3209). By introducing tree explicit route object (TERO) and enhancing conventional Path/Resv signaling procedures to enable tree based LSP setup, the proposed protocol can set any kind of P2MP LSPs; cost minimum (Steiner) P2MP LSP, delay-constrained P2MP LSP according to application demands. The proposed protocol also supports dynamic partial tree modification mechanism; Grafting and Pruning to handle dynamic multicast traffic. Therefore, P2MP LSP is modified easily. Several scalability and performance evaluations are conducted in this paper to prove its feasibility. This paper also proposes a multicast constrained shortest path fast (CSPF) mechanism to support dynamic QoS constrained P2MP LSPs setup. We confirmed that proposed schemes are scalable and has enough performance to be applied to future large scale IP service convergence network."
2399665,21212,369,Resource Allocation for Two-Way OFDM Relay Networks with Fairness Constraints,2009,"In this paper, a new resource allocation scheme is proposed for a two-way OFDM relay network. In the proposed scheme, two terminals exchange information with the help of multiple relays, and subcarriers and their power are successively allocated to the relays to maximize sum capacity. To achieve fairness for the relays, power constraint on each relay is imposed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves sum capacity and fairness significantly. I. INTRODUCTION Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pro- vides reliable and high data rate communications in wireless networks (1). In an OFDM system, bandwidth for data trans- mission is divided into a number of orthogonal subcarriers and each subcarrier experiences independent frequency-flat fading. In the multiuser OFDM system, frequency diversity and multiuser diversity are obtained by adaptive resource allocation (2), (3). Cooperative relaying obtains spatial diversity without hav- ing a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna array but additional channel resources are required for relay trans- mission (4). By combining cooperative relaying with either superposition coding or network coding, two-way relaying provides improved spectral efficiency compared with one-way cooperative relaying (5). In two-way relaying, two terminals exchange information with each other via a single or multiple relays. In a single relay network, various relaying protocols are proposed to reduce the required channel resources (5). In (6), two-way relaying is combined with OFDM so that sum capacity is increased by power allocation and tone permutation. In a multiple relay network, it is known that diversity gain is increased as the number of relays increases, and the distributed space time coding scheme and the opportunistic relaying scheme are proposed for two-way relaying (7), (8). However, combining two-way relaying with OFDM in the multiple relay network has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a new resource allocation scheme for a two-way OFDM relay network. In the proposed scheme, a number of relays in good channel condition are selected, and the subcarriers and their power are successively allocated to the selected relays based on the instantaneous channel condition. Compared with the opportunistic relaying scheme in which a single best relay is selected, multiuser diversity may be exploited as the number of selected relays increases. To achieve fairness for the relays, maximum power constraint is imposed on each relay. This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes a system model and problem formulation. A new resource allocation scheme is proposed in Section III. Section IV shows simulation results and Section V concludes this paper. II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION"
1839185,21212,8228,Non-Weighted Interface Specific Routing for Load-Balanced Fast Local Protection in IP Networks,2011,"As a failure occurs, the affected traffic is quickly rerouted to backup paths for a network performing a fast protection scheme. Such a prompt reaction is aimed to reduce the damages caused by a failure. However, in some cases, the rerouted traffic may cause congestion along the backup paths which would lead to more packet losses than purely discarded affected flows. In this paper, we propose a load-balanced fast local protection scheme called Non-Weighted Interface Specific Routing (NISR) for determining the working and backup routing tables of IP routers. We jointly consider protection switching time, network survivability, and traffic load distribution together in the proposed scheme. In NISR, once a failure occurs, only the nodes adjacent to a failure divert affected traffic to backup paths. This local reaction process guarantees fast protection switching and reduces failure recovery time. Unlike the conventional IP routing, our approach relaxes the shortest path routing in computing working and backup routing tables. Most importantly, each interface in a router has its own routing tables. Combining the interface specific routing with the shortest path relaxation provides greater routing flexibility to enhance network survivability and load balancing. We formulate this as a mixed integer programming problem in which the traffic load on the most congested link is to be minimized. Since this problem is intractable by its NP-hard nature, we further decompose it into several sub-problems which are solved optimally and their solutions combined to provide a solution to the original problem. We perform experiments on some benchmark networks and compare the proposed scheme to several well-known schemes (including LFA, ECMP, OSPF, and NLB) on survivability ratio, link load distribution, and average path length for both normal and failure states. Through numerical results, we delineate that the proposed scheme achieves a sub-optimal solution, which is better for its high survivability and load balancing at the expense of slightly raising the average path hop count."
1926916,21212,369,Detection of Primary Users with Distributed Spectrum Sensors over Rayleigh Fading Channel,2009,"This study addresses detection of primary users (PUs) for cognitive radio system (CRS) with distributed spectrum sensors (DSSs) in Rayleigh fading environment. Two sensing schemes using DSSs that employ energy detection (ED) are investigated as cooperative sensing and collaborative sensing. For the cooperative sensing, each DSS makes hard decision after sensing and transmits the information by on-off keying (OOK) singling to a secondary user (SU) that performs data fusion. In collaborative sensing DSSs exchange the hard decision information after sensing and make data fusion at a selected DSS. Then, the selected DSS transmits the decision information to the SU with OOK signaling. In this paper, a closed-form expression for the probability of detection (PD) of ED with selective combining (SC) in Rayleigh fading environment is derived. Applying this expression to the PU detection problem, analytical models for evaluating the two sensing schemes are obtained. Results show that at 5-dB signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) and using 3 DSSs, the PD is increased from 0.02 to 0.3 and 0.4 by collaborative sensing and collaborative sensing, respectively. I. INTRODUCTION Many existing wireless systems are regulated by a fixed spectrum assignment strategy. The policy partitions the whole spectrum into a large number of different ranges. Each piece is specified for a particular system. This leads to undesirable situations where a large portion of frequency bands is unoc- cupied or only partially occupied (1). Cognitive radio system (CRS) (2) has the potential to boost the evolution of wireless communication by allowing unlicensed users or secondary users (SUs) to dynamically access those temporally unused frequency spectrum in licensed band of primary users (PUs). The functionalities of the CRS can be classified into cognitive engine (CE), sensing and interface. Sensing as a key functional entity measures the radio frequency environment. Then, the sensing information is passed from the sensing entity to CE through the interface. Based on the sensing information, the CE residing in SUs determines the presence of PUs and makes spectrum access decision. Currently, the IEEE P1900.6 working group is ac- tively developing the standard of sensing interface and data structure required for sensing information exchange among CEs and sensing entities (3). The standard supports the sensing functionality to be realized by distributed spectrum sensors (DSSs) (4). This promotes innovation of sensing technologies. In this study, we consider two sensing schemes, cooperative sensing and collaborative sensing, for PU detection using DSSs where there are N number of spectrum sensors, Si,"
1219422,21212,21066,Using stochastic approximation to design OSPF routing areas that satisfy multiple and diverse end-to-end performance requirements,2008,"Dividing an open shortest path first (OSPF) autonomous system (AS) into independent routing areas allows area topology abstraction, reducing route overhead, table size, and convergence time, while providing some isolation from bad routing data. On the contrary, areas reduce connectivity, while increasing configuration complexity, routing path length, and traffic concentration. The formation of performance efficient OSPF areas subject to multiple requirements is known to be NP-complete problem; however, some simple heuristics have been used to optimize for particular routing metrics. For example, a min-cut can be used to ensure balanced number of nodes per area. However, no existing tools can optimize for actual end-to- end performance requirements or take into account the characteristics of network topology. This paper describes a fast and flexible optimization tool that automates the design of open shortest path first (OSPF) routing areas to meet heterogeneous end-to-end performance requirements. The tool is based on an enhanced version of simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, which is a general stochastic approximation method capable of handling multiple, diverse and conflicting requirements (multi-objective optimization). The simulated annealing based tool can provide from highly optimized solutions for network planners designing conventional wired OSPF networks with known application flows to scalability and robust solutions in wireless networks using MANET OSPF extensions with changing application needs. This paper formulates the OSPF areas design as a weighted-sum multi-objective optimization of routing metrics to maximize user capacity, while minimizing the increased delay and lost connectivity. For diverse topologies, we show significantly reduced user delay (over 25%) and increased available bandwidth (by over 400%). Further, we show that by simply adjusting the weights, the tool can prioritize the performance requirements and adapt to heterogeneous network environments."
545583,21212,8228,Dynamic SIR based admission control algorithm for 3G wireless networks,2003,"Next generation wireless systems, as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), aim at revolutionizing the actual wireless communication paradigm offering real time multimedia services now available on fixed terminals whose quality of service (QoS) requirements could be satisfied by network resources adaptation to traffic conditions. Since radio interface is based on CDMA technology, this system suffers form mutual interference among active connections. Approximately, the communication quality decreases at the increasing of active users number. As a consequence, there exists an active user threshold below which an intolerable QoS degradation is produces, especially for those applications named in 3GPP standard as interactive or background. Therefore, proper admission control (AC) algorithm that mitigates mutual interference by keeping active users under a dynamic threshold, is a crucial topic in UMTS system optimization. This paper deals with an advanced AC scheme proposal that estimates the requesting connections signal to noise plus interference ratio (SINR) by means of accurate multiple access interference (MAI) analysis results. Basically, this algorithm verifies the possibility of a new call admission by valuating if an overall power configuration there exists, whose predicted SINR values satisfy each QoS constraints. Whenever a new connection is accepted, a further optimization is performed in order to allow a QoS higher than the requested value under a maximum radiated power constraint. This value is delivered to power control (PC) algorithm jointly with the associated SINR value. Numerical simulations, closely related to an UMTS system, underline a remarkable number of active users increase up to four times traditional AC policies, together with the maximization of QoS requirements."
1228748,21212,8228,Power-efficient downlink communication using large antenna arrays: The doughnut channel,2012,"Large antenna arrays at the base station can facilitate power efficient single user downlink communication due to the inherent array power gain, i.e., under an average only total transmit power constraint, for a fixed desired information rate, the required total transmit power can be reduced by increasing the number of base station antennas (e.g. with i.i.d. fading, the required total transmit power can be reduced by roughly 3 dB with every doubling in the number of base station antennas, i.e., an O(N) array power gain can be achieved with N antennas). However, in practice, building power efficient large antenna arrays would require power efficient amplifiers/analog RF components. With current technology, highly linear power amplifiers generally have low power efficiency, and therefore linearity constraints on power amplifiers must be relaxed. Under such relaxed linearity constraints, the transmit signal that suffers the least distortion is a signal with constant envelope (CE). In this paper, we consider a single user Gaussian multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink channel where the signal transmitted from each antenna is constrained to have a constant envelope (i.e., for every channel-use the amplitude of the signal transmitted from each antenna is constant, irrespective of the channel realization). We show that under such a per-antenna CE constraint, the complex noise-free received signal lies in the interior of a “doughnut” shaped region in the complex plane. The per-antenna CE constrained MISO channel is therefore equivalent to a doughnut channel, i.e., a single-input single-output (SISO) AWGN channel where the channel input is constrained to lie inside a “doughnut” shaped region. Using this equivalence, we analytically compute a closed-form expression for an achievable information rate under the per-antenna CE constraint. We then show that, for a broad class of fading channels (i.i.d. and direct-line-of-sight (DLOS)), even under the more stringent per-antenna CE constraint (compared to the average only total power constraint), an O(N) array power gain can still be achieved with N base station antennas. We also show that with N ≫1, compared to the average only total transmit power constrained channel, the extra total transmit power required under the per-antenna CE constraint, to achieve a desired information rate is small and bounded for a broad class of fading channels (i.i.d. and DLOS). We also propose novel CE precoding algorithms. The analysis and algorithms presented are general and therefore applicable to conventional systems with a small number of antennas. Analytical results are supported with numerical results for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel."
2868586,21212,8228,Waveform design for massive MISO downlink with energy-efficient receivers adopting 1-bit ADCs,2016,"In high-density low-bitrate Internet-of-Things (IoT) use case of 5G networks, the terminals and sensors are to be of extremely low-cost and low energy-consuming. Typically, the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) dominate the power-budget of receiver chains, in particular if the quantization resolution is high. Hence, receiver architectures deploying 1-bit ADCs are of high interest towards realizing low-cost, high energy-efficiency device solutions. In this paper, we study the waveform design and optimization for a narrowband low-bitrate massive MISO downlink targeting to achieve rates higher than 1 bits/sec (per real-dimension) where the terminal receivers adopt only simple 1-bit quantization (per real-dimension) with oversampling. In this respect, first we show that for a particular precoder structure, the overall link is equivalent to that of an AWGN SISO with controlled intersymbol interference (ISI). The filter design problem for generating the desired ISI in such SISO links has been studied in previous works, however, the only known method in literature is a computationally demanding brute force search method. As a novel contribution, we develop models and tools that elaborate on the conditions to be satisfied for unique detection and existence of solution for the filter coefficients. Then, as a concrete example, the developed models and tools are utilized to show that in the absence of noise, five-times oversampling is required for unique detection of 16-QAM input alphabet. Building on these findings, we then develop novel algorithms that can efficiently design the filter coefficients. Examples and simulations are provided to elaborate on filter coefficient design and optimization, and to illustrate good SER performance of the MISO link with 1-bit receiver even at SNRs down to 5 dB."
634017,21212,8228,Communications using ubiquitous antennas: Free-space propagation,2015,"The inefficiency of the cellular-network architecture has prevented the promising theoretic gains of communication technologies such as network MIMO, massive MIMO and distributed antennas from fully materializing in practice. The revolutionary cell-less cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) are under active development to overcome the drawbacks of cellular networks. In C-RANs, centralized cloud signal processing and minimum onsite hardware make it possible to deploy ubiquitous distributed antennas and coordinate them to form a gigantic array, called the ubiquitous array (UA). This paper focuses on designing techniques for UA communications and characterizing their performance. To this end, the UA is modeled as a continuous circular array enclosing target mobiles and free-space propagation is assumed, which allows the use of mathematical tools including Fourier series and Bessel functions in the analysis. First, exploiting the UA's large circular structure, a novel scheme for multiuser channel estimation is proposed to support noiseless channel estimation using only single pilot symbols. Channel estimation errors due to interference are proved to be Bessel functions of inter-user distances normalized by the wavelength. Besides increasing the distances, it is shown that the errors can be also suppressed by using pilot sequences and eliminated if the sequence length is longer than the number of mobiles. Next, for data communication, we first consider channel conjugate transmission that compensates the phase shift in propagation and thereby allows receive coherent combining. The multiuser interference powers are derived as Bessel functions of normalized inter-user distances. Last, we propose the design of multiuser precoders in the form of Fourier series whose coefficients excite different phase modes of the UA. Under the zero-forcing constraints, the precoder coefficients are proved to lie in the null space of a derived matrix with elements being Bessel functions of normalized inter-user distances."
1586813,21212,369,Aggregate Interference Analysis for Interweave Cognitive Networks,2014,"This paper investigates the aggregate interference from interweave cognitive secondary nodes spatially distributed in a finite Poisson field. These secondary nodes sense an out- of-band beacon to initiate their transmissions, which can be concurrent with those of the primary system if a sensing error is made. The resulting aggregate interference is analyzed in this paper. For this purpose, general Nakagami-m fading and path-loss are assumed for all relevant channels. Moreover, we incorporate random secondary node transmit powers with any probability distribution. The analysis includes the exact moment generating function (MGF) of the aggregate interference along with the exact outage probability of the primary system. Furthermore, we develop a simple MGF approximation which is valid for severely fading channels and for lower beacon reception threshold to beacon transmit power ratios. Finally, we show that a lower fading severity significantly improves the diversity order of the PR due to more accurate spectrum sensing by the secondary nodes. I. INTRODUCTION Secondary nodes of interweave cognitive radio (CR) net- works sense unused frequency chunks (1) by processing a bea- con signal (pilot channel) transmitted from either the primary transmitter or the primary receiver (PR) (2). If the beacon is detected, the secondary nodes will cease transmission within that particular frequency slot. If not, they are allowed to use it. Consequently, if secondary nodes misdetect the beacon signal, their concurrent transmissions with those of the primary system interfere with and degrade the performance of the PR. Beacon misdetection may be caused by wireless signals undergoing path-loss, fading, and shadowing. The aggregate interference due to beacon misdetection also depends on the random secondary node distribution (numbers and locations). Statistical characterization of the aggregate interference helps in the design of system parameters (suitable node densities, ge- ographical areas for deployment etc.), power control schemes, and sensing schemes in practical CR standards such as IEEE 802.22 (3). To this end, this paper analyzes the aggregate interference, and PR performance for interweave CR networks. A. Previous Research"
1405337,21212,8228,Unidirectional error correction by crypto functions,2013,"Asymmetric errors are observed in many communication channels or memory systems. Some non-volatile memory systems and optical media exhibit such error behavior in a unidirectional fashion. The lifetime of such units depends often on aging, and especially on the number of access cycles performed resulting with such unidirectional error behavior. In many applications, error correcting codes are not deployed in order to save redundancy, costs and complexity. However in many applications, there are security operations such as encryption or hash functions providing strict rules which can serve to detect and even correct errors. Error correcting codes use basically linear mappings, whereas crypto functions involve highly nonlinear confusion and diffusion randomizing functions. In this paper, some hash functions used for authentication are investigated to check experimentally their symmetric and especially unidirectional error correctability. Good hash functions and ciphers are designed to attain a high degree of pseudo-randomizing mappings. Our experimental results on such hash functions showed that, it is possible to efficiently correct a class of selected unidirectional errors by deploying a portion of the hash bits which are typically used solely for authentication. The proposed correction procedure is a hard decision trade-off operation which would improve the system-survivability by slightly reducing its authenticity level without changing the system configuration. This procedure allows a sort of best-effort salvation in some existing systems. The procedure simply modifies the corrupted data experimentally until the hash value becomes valid. This procedure may however turn out to become equivalent to a successful authentication attack. This is however less probable if only a part of the hash bits is deployed in the error correction procedure and if the corrected error-class is kept as small as possible."
2261962,21212,8228,Wireless switch protocol,2003,"In IEEE 802.11 infrastructure wireless local area networks (WLAN), all mobile stations (STAs) are coordinated by an access point (AP), which is a static device and plays the role of the bridge between wired and wireless networks. Such coordination is achieved by restricting all STAs to access the channel listened by AP. Within the 2.4 GHz unlicensed industry, science, and medicine (ISM) band defined in the IEEE 802.11 2.4 GHz physical layer (PHY) specifications, three of fourteen channels, which are independent and exclusive, can be used to transfer data packets at a same area concurrently. However, in most small/medium enterprises or home environments, one AP is sufficient for covering whole service area. This implies that the other two channels' capacity has being wasted by the single channel operation defined in standard. In order to overcome the drawback, we propose a new and simple CSMA based media access control (MAC) protocol, named wireless switch protocol (WSP), for promoting the IEEE 802.11 aggregate network throughput. This is simply achieved by allowing any pair of STAs in WLAN to exchange data packets in another idle channel after their handshaking with each other in the common channel, which is specified by AP. Simulation results show that the total network throughput of WSP is obviously depending on the time taken by the changing frequency channel and the intranet and Internet traffic distribution, where the intranet and Internet mean the data exchanged between mobile STAs, and between STA and wired host, respectively. If all data packets are intranet traffic and the traffic load is heavy, the improving ratio of derived goodput of proposed WSP and that of the IEEE 802.11 standard approximates 400%. In the worse case that all traffic is Internet traffic, the proposed WSP still obtains the similar throughput as that of IEEE 802.11 standard."
1763525,21212,8228,Improving performance of rate control mechanism for UDP traffic over heterogeneous networks,2013,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an application-driven heterogeneous network, being rapidly deployed across the world. The proposed session layer for IoT is the upcoming standard for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The transport layer of choice for IoT is emerging to be UDP. CoAP itself mandates usage of UDP only as the transport layer. It is well-known that practical usage of UDP requires extra employment of congestion control, generally in form of rate control. For bursty source data that is generated most of the while in IoT, usage of rate control is a must. Configuring the rate control parameters requires knowledge of the performance of the underlying network. In this paper, we first experimentally measure, analyze and model performance parameters, e.g. avg. bandwidth, round-trip delay and jitter, of a real heterogeneous wide area network. Based on the analysis, we then provide two novel, intuitive algorithms for source node rate control, and destination node timer management. These algorithms were found to improve the reception performance over that achievable using guidelines provided in RFC 5405. For delivery of urgent/critical data in IoT, we had earlier proposed usage of session-level forward error control (FEC) of the communicated data. Usage of our algorithms ensured that the deployment of the FEC scheme, which employed lightweight rate-10/11 Reed-Solomon codes, succeeded 98% of the while, while sending as many as 10 packets per burst. The algorithms can be re-used with similar high performance levels, in many other communication contexts also, that entail low-volume, bursty data traffic visualized in RFC 5405. Hence the algorithms may be considered for augmentation of CoAP standard."
2385181,21212,8228,Spectrum Sensing for OFDM Systems Employing Pilot Tones and Application to DVB-T OFDM,2008,"Spectrum sensing is one of the core technologies of cognitive radio (CR) systems which provide a viable solution to the problem of sparsity of wireless spectrum. Nowadays, OFDM techniques are adopted by many existing or progressing wireless communication standards. Thus, a robust spectrum sensing algorithm for OFDM modulated signals is highly desired to implement CR when the primary signal uses OFDM modulation. Motivated by this demand, a time-domain symbol cross-correlation based spectrum sensing algorithm (TDSC method) is presented in this paper. The algorithm makes use of the property that the mean of the TDSC of two OFDM symbols is not zero if they have embedded the same frequency-domain pilot tones. The statistical behavior of the proposed spectrum sensor is explicitly analyzed and a theoretical lower bound on the misdetection probability is derived in this paper. An intuitive spectrum sensing method which utilizes the cyclic prefix nature of the OFDM modulated signals (CP method) is also described in this paper as a reference for comparison. Finally, we use the DVB-T Standard [8] as an application example to illustrate the proposed spectrum sensing algorithm. The simulated channel environments are the Ricean and Rayleigh channels defined in the DVB-T Standard and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Four CP ratios defined in the DVB-T Standard are simulated for the probability of false alarm equaling 0.01 and the sensing time set equal to 50 ms. Simulation results show that the TDSC method can achieve a misdetection probability of 0.1 when the SNR equals -20.5 dB for all four CP ratios. The TDSC method outperforms the CP method in all cases. Furthermore, the proposed method has approximately the same detection performance for different CP ratios while the detection performance of the CP method degrades dramatically when the CP ratio becomes small. Results also reveal that the simulated performance is very close to the theoretical lower bound indicating that the lower bound can be used as a good prediction of performance."
2222459,21212,10192,Improving the Bit-per-Joule Performance of IEEE 802.11 Based Wireless Networks through High Power Transmissions,2008,"Energy consumption is of utmost importance in ad hoc wireless networks where battery-operated nodes have limited power resources. Energy consumption is also important in meshed WLAN networks such as emerging home entertainment networks and meshed WiMax metropolitan area networks. So far, it has been advocated that nodes have to operate at the lowest possible power level that keeps the network connected in order to best conserve energy in the system. This approach however results in increased internal traffic and forces more nodes to be awake to relay information to the intended receivers. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the transmit power and the transmit data rate on the bit-per-joule performance of IEEE 802.11 based ad hoc wireless networks. We assume nodes to use software controlled radios whose modulation/coding scheme and rate parameters can be dynamically selected. We then develop an analytical model to calculate the energy consumption rate in the network. Our model takes into account the energy spent when the nodes are idle or asleep, when transmitting control packets, as well as when relaying, retransmitting and receiving packets. We examine the performance efficiency of the throughput per unit energy consumed attained under the employment of different jointly selected transmit power levels and data rates. We then compare the results attained using our analytical model with results attained via simulation using transmit power levels and data rate values found in commercially available IEEE 802.11b WLAN cards. Our results show that, when traffic is uniformly distributed across the area of operations, increasing the nodal transmit power level increases the bits/sec per watt, (or, equivalently, the bit per joule) performance of the network."
360847,21212,8228,Forwarding interfering signals in wireless ad hoc networks under MRC receiver processing,2015,"Cooperation in wireless networks is embraced today both from cellular and device-to-device (D2D) communication standards. The reason is that this communication paradigm offers much-needed improvements in the spectral efficiency of wireless communication. Its foundation is the cooperation between nodes that are physically in close proximity. This means that it can fit very well in modern networks that are characterized by increased densities of both infrastructure and users. However, higher node density and higher number of opportunities for cooperation means also more interference. In this paper we investigate the potential throughput gain in a densely deployed interference-limited wireless network when the nodes cooperate. We consider a simple cooperative protocol that allows the relays to overhear the interfering signals and then they amplify and forward (AF) the received composite signal. We consider that the final destination employs maximum ratio combining (MRC) of the directly received signal and the forwarded interference. Given the previous protocol and decoding algorithm, we formulate the problem of link scheduling and cooperative interference forwarding (LSCIF) as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) that is solved numerically. In the proposed problem formulation the aggregate signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) expression is decomposed into two separate SIR constraints. In practice this means that the signal that is received at a relay is allowed to be forwarded (the relay link is scheduled) even if the SIR of this particular signal is below the level that the final receiver can decode. Results are presented for the optimal solution and a polynomial time approximation algorithm for different traffic loads, number of relays, and demonstrate significant performance gains."
1898479,21212,8228,Triage-based automated analysis of evidence in court cases of copyright infringement,2012,"Over the past few years, the number of crimes related to the worldwide diffusion of digital devices with large storage and broadband network connections has increased dramatically. In order to better address the problem, law enforcement specialists have developed new ideas and methods for retrieving evidence more effectively. In accordance with this trend, our research aims to add new pieces of information to the automated analysis of evidence according to Machine Learning-based “post mortem” triage. The scope consists of some copyright infringement court cases coming from the Italian Cybercrime Police Unit database. We draw our inspiration from this “low level” crime which is normally sat at the bottom of the forensic analyst's queue, behind higher priority cases and dealt with the lowest priority. The present work aims to bring order back in the analyst's queue by providing a method to rank each queued item, e.g. a seized device, before being analyzed in detail. The paper draws the guidelines for drive-under-triage classification (e.g. hard disk drive, thumb drive, solid state drive etc.), according to a list of crime-dependent features such as installed software, file statistics and browser history. The model, inspired by the theory of Data Mining and Machine Learning, is able to classify each exhibit by predicting the problem dependent variable (i.e. the class) according to the aforementioned crime-dependent features. In our research context the “class” variable identifies with the likelihood that a drive image may contain evidence concerning the crime and, thus, the associated item must receive an high (or low) ranking in the list."
1866750,21212,8228,Channel quality-based AMC and smart scheduling scheme for SVC video transmission in LTE MBSFN networks,2012,"Mobile TV and Video on Demand (VoD) streaming services represents an important service which will be provided by Fourth Generation (4G) cellular networks. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) is one of the most successful 4G technologies used by most of the 4G operators for delivering mobile broadband. In the past, cellular systems have mostly focused on unicast transmission systems. But, with the adoption of new services which are intended to be delivered to a broad range of users, multicast and broadcast systems are becoming widely popular. Enhanced Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (EMBMS) is defined in 3GPP specification to support download delivery and streaming delivery to group users in LTE mobile networks. In 3GPP Release 8 specification, the EMBMS transmission is classified into single-cell transmission and MBSFN (Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network) transmission. H.264 was the recommended video codec for Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) MBMS service. However, the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of H.264 allows efficient temporal, spatial and quality scalabilities. In this paper, we propose a video streaming method with SVC for MBSFN networks with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and frequency scheduling based on distribution of users in different channel quality regions. Through simulations we demonstrate that spectrum savings in the order of 72 to 82% is achievable in different user distribution scenarios with our proposed scheme. These savings in spectrum can be used for serving other MBSFN, single cell MBMS or unicast bearers, and it can also be used for increasing the video quality of the same MBSFN bearer."
2528431,21212,8228,"Incremental, dynamic, virtual circuit connection (IVCC): a new paradigm for routing in future high-speed networks",2001,"This paper presents a new routing strategy, termed incremental virtual circuit connection (IVCC), that is ideally suited for a class of call requests that promise to underlie future high-speed networks. IVCC aims to reduce the idling of reserved resources, thereby improving the sharing of network resources among users and increasing call success rate. Under IVCC, the subsequent subpaths, starting at the source node, are computed, reserved, and utilized incrementally. Initially, the source node (SN) computes the entire path all the way to the destination node (DN), but propagates the call admission control (CAC) to reserve network resources only for a subset of the entire path, where the choice of the subpath is based on the organization and topology of the network. This paper hypothesizes that the efficient use of resources in IVCC will significantly reduce the probability of failures. Thus, IVCC's uniqueness consists of two key elements. First, the actual route for a source traffic is successively and dynamically refined, utilizing up-to-date information on the state of the network, but always keeping an eye towards the destination. Second, traffic cells are launched from the source node or any of the intermediate nodes only after the network resources along the subsequent subpath have been reserved. IVCC has been modeled for two representative ATM networks, a 15-node network spread over the continental US and a 50-node network extending throughout the world, and extensively simulated for a large number of realistic input traffic stimuli utilizing an asynchronous distributed simulation algorithm running on a network of workstations. For a comparative analysis, ATM Forum's P-NNI is also modeled and simulated for identical networks and under identical traffic conditions."
2432875,21212,8228,A Distributed Scheme for Responsive Network Engineering,2007,"Optimal bandwidth utilisation together with resilience and recovery from failure are two key drivers for traffic engineering (TE) which have been widely addressed by the IP community. Most current IGP routing protocols deployed in the Internet and the extensions proposed to adapt these protocols for TE are concerned either with optimality or with resilience. This leads to a duplication of routing protocols and algorithms where each of these objectives (optimality, resilience) is addressed by its own protocol or algorithm. The interactions among these protocols introduce additional complexities which do not necessarily translate into equivalent performance gains. This paper aims at the integration of these two objectives into a unified network resource controller. At random time instants the NRC computes bandwidth prices which are used in an automated scheme to dynamically adjust the bandwidths of the network paths in response to the traffic and network equipment conditions. The distinguishing features of the NRC are that it works without centralised control and thus scales to large networks, and that rather than using TE to move network flows to where the network bandwidth is located, the NRC uses network engineering (NE) to move network bandwidth to where the network flows are located. We next present an efficient heuristic to find diversely routed backup paths and to provision the network links with the least amount of backup (spare) bandwidth in order to be able to deploy equivalent recovery paths for any failure scenario which leaves the network connected. Simulation results are presented which show that the reallocation scheme provides prompt bandwidth provisioning both for random traffic fluctuations during normal operating conditions, and when provisioning recovery routes in the event of network failure."
2378694,21212,8228,Video Quality Prediction Model for H.264 Video over UMTS Networks and Their Application in Mobile Video Streaming,2010,"Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) is a third generation mobile communication systems that supports wireless wideband multimedia applications. The objective of this paper is to present a new model for non-intrusive prediction of H.264 encoded video quality over UMTS networks and to illustrate their application to video quality monitoring and adaptation in mobile wireless streaming services. First, we present an efficient regression model for predicting video quality non-intrusively for all content types. The model is predicted from a combination of a set of objective parameters in the application and physical layer in terms of the Mean opinion Score (MOS). The application layer parameters considered are the content type, sender bitrate and frame rate and the physical layer parameters are the block error rate modeled with 2-state Markov model for a mean burst length of 1.75. The performance of the proposed metric is evaluated with unseen dataset with good prediction accuracy. Second, we illustrate the application of the model in mobile streaming services by presenting a new Sender Bitrate (SBR) adaptation scheme at pre-encoding stage that is Quality of Experience (QoE) driven. The scheme was tested and evaluated in the NS2 based UMTS simulation network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation scheme in terms of the MOS and especially at the UMTS network bottleneck access where perceived video quality is most affected. The proposed scheme was responsive to available network bandwidth and congestion and adapted the SBR accordingly maintaining acceptable quality in terms of the MOS. The proposed scheme has applications in network planning and content provisioning for network/service providers."
1472174,21212,8228,Ameba network architecture based on advanced multi-layer network and its configuration algorithm,2013,"In future networks, unknown and unintended traffic implosion and hot spot congestion may give serious damage because of heavy traffic implosion and rapid traffic fluctuation. To tackle this issue, the research on virtual network and next-generation network has been advancing. As a result, network control can be much more flexible than before. However, from the perspective of network architecture, the current approaches with fixed IP node/OXC node location still remain larger possibility to enhance the flexibility. Namely, novel solution is eagerly anticipated. For realization of highly advanced next-generation network, this paper suggests novel network architecture that can decrease a network scale, especially, not at the link level but at the entire topology level by adaptively leveraging the underlying OXC networks and by making virtual node function composed of several distantly positioned OXCs, named “Ameba Node”. Main benefits of the proposed Ameba Network include as follows. First, network-level load balancing can be attained by adaptively reconfiguring the Ameba network topology without any other complicated traffic engineering. Second, simple and naive routing algorithm and network controls would be applied thanks to its network level load-balancing capability. Thirdly, IP routing/optical-layer routing processes, and the resultant network resources can be balanced flexibly. Finally, flexibility on node renewal or network scale-up can be realized by not replacing old routers to most advanced brand-new ones but reconfiguring the shape of Ameba nodes in network adaptively. We also evaluate its effectiveness by computer simulation."
389182,21212,8228,QoS aware energy-efficient resource scheduling for HetNet CoMP,2015,"In this paper, the energy-efficient resource scheduling is investigated considering quality of service (QoS) constraints for OFDMA based heterogeneous network (HetNet). The energy efficiency (EE) is measured as “throughput (bits) per Joule”, while the power consumption model includes RF transmit and circuit power (i.e. feeder loss, cite cooling, signal processing). Compared to existing literature on QoS aware method which mainly consider sum throughput or total transmission power as objective function for optimization, we investigate and model an optimization problem to maximize the EE subject to users' QoS requirements. Given QoS (data rate) requirement for maximizing EE, a constrained based optimization problem is devised. Since the optimization problem is non-convex in nature, we reconstruct the optimization problem as a convex one and devise a pragmatically efficient novel resource assignment algorithm for maximizing achievable EE with quick convergence. The considered optimization problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem by redefining the constraint using the cubic inequality satisfying certain conditions to prove non-negativity, which leads to the problem to be solve as a convex optimization method and results in an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the transformed problem is solved by using Lagrangian dual decomposition with a projected gradient method. Analytical insights and numerical results exhibit the potency of the devised scheme for the targeted complex wireless systems. Our analysis also provides design guidelines for the future design and deployment of green wireless networks as approach the 5G era."
668586,21212,8228,Stability analysis of a parallel packet switch with bufferless input demultiplexers,2001,"A class of packet switching systems with inverse multiplexing of switched connections and/or flows (the SCIMUX architecture) has been previously proposed. Such systems open the possibility to use the readily available switch fabrics and port cards in order to build fully-functional packet switches, operating at rates much higher than those of their own components taken in isolation. While a comprehensive analytical study of such systems is in high demand, it remains a largely unexplored research area. We consider the parallel packet switch (PPS) architecture, which is a variation of the SCIMUX architecture with the switching core composed of multiple parallel independent switching planes, restricting our attention to the case with bufferless input demultiplexers. We formalize the notion of comparing degrees of congestion in the switches operating at the different port rates by introducing the concept of relative stability. We describe a family of traffic dispatch algorithms and prove that they are necessary and sufficient to guarantee relative stability of a switching plane in the PPS architecture. Finally, we obtain a tight lower bound on the number of required switching planes K, show that the equivalent core speedup bound is given by S/spl ges/K/[K/2], and prove that meeting these bounds is necessary and sufficient to achieve stability of the entire PPS core. Our results assume a work-conserving behavior of each switching plane without imposing any restrictions on the queuing structure and service discipline. They naturally generalize to the case of multiple traffic flows between the same pair of external ports and may be applied to QoS-aware switches. The described algorithms are fully distributed and do not require state information of any kind to be exchanged between the architecture components."
1356319,21212,8228,Cell switch off technique combined with coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission for energy efficiency in beyond-LTE cellular networks,2012,"With the ever increasing usage of wireless devices, the power consumption and energy efficiency of cellular networks have become important performance indicators. In recent years, various types of energy saving schemes have been proposed for cellular networks. However, most of these schemes do not take advantage of the advanced features offered by the recent cellular standards, such as the 3GPP release 10 (also known as LTE-Advanced) and beyond. One of the recently proposed energy saving schemes in cellular networks is the cell switch off technique in which a lightly loaded cell is completely switched off and the traffic in that region is absorbed by the nearby cells whose transmit powers are increased to enable larger coverage areas. In this paper, we propose to use the cell switch off scheme without increasing the transmit powers of the active cells; instead, we propose to use the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission radio technology, which is being standardized for the beyond-LTE cellular networks, to enable a sufficient received power level from a number of nearby cells whenever possible. Through simulations with realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the above described cell switch off + CoMP combination used with proper CoMP active set degree yields a more energy efficient solution with better received user experience in comparison to the traditional cell switch off schemes. In the proposed scheme, channel estimations are needed in order to determine the CoMP active set accurately. We analyze the performance by modeling the channel estimation error as a Gaussian random variable with 4, 8, and 12 dB standard deviation and observe that perfect channel estimation can provide up to 46% capacity and 24% energy efficiency increase in comparison to the scenarios with the channel estimation errors."
512310,21212,8228,Dynamic time-domain duplexing for self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular networks,2015,"Millimeter wave (mmW) bands between 30 and 300 GHz have attracted considerable attention for nextgeneration cellular networks due to vast quantities of available spectrum and the possibility of very high-dimensional antenna arrays. However, a key issue in these systems is range: mmW signals are extremely vulnerable to shadowing and poor high-frequency propagation. Multi-hop relaying is therefore a natural technology for such systems to improve cell range and cell edge rates without the addition of wired access points. This paper studies the problem of scheduling for a simple infrastructure cellular relay system where communication between wired base stations and User Equipment follow a hierarchical tree structure through fixed relay nodes. Such a systems builds naturally on existing cellular mmW backhaul by adding mmW in the access links. A key feature of the proposed system is that TDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional isolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for centralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the duplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD mmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel conditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved resource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static, globally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based on empirically-derived channel models at 28 GHz."
2084105,21212,20338,On the feasibility of effective opportunistic spectrum access,2010,"Dynamic spectrum access networks are designed to allow today's bandwidth hungry secondary devices to share spectrum allocated to legacy devices, or primary users. The success of this wireless communication model relies on the availability of unused spectrum, and the ability of secondary devices to utilize spectrum without disrupting transmissions of primary users. While recent measurement studies have shown that there is sufficient underutilized spectrum available, little is known about whether secondary devices can efficiently make use of available spectrum while minimizing disruptions to primary users.   In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the presence of usable spectrum in opportunistic spectrum access systems, and whether sufficient spectrum can be extracted by secondary devices to support traditional networking applications. We use for our study fine-grain usage traces of a wide spectrum range (20MHz--6GHz) taken at 4 locations in Germany, the Netherlands, and Santa Barbara, California. Our study shows that on average, 54% of spectrum is never used and 26% is only partially used. Surprisingly, in this 26% of partially used spectrum, secondary devices can utilize very little spectrum using conservative access policies to minimize interference with primary users. Even assuming an optimal access scheme and extensive statistical knowledge of primary user access patterns, a user can only extract between 20-30% of the total available spectrum. To provide better spectrum availability, we propose  frequency bundling , where secondary devices build reliable channels by combining multiple unreliable frequencies into virtual frequency bundles. Analyzing our traces, we find that there is little correlation of spectrum availability across channels, and that bundling random channels together can provide sustained periods of reliable transmission with only short interruptions."
1991796,21212,10228,A Unified QoS-Inspired Load Optimization Framework for Multiple Access Points Based Wireless LANs,2009,"The extensive deployment of 802.11 WLAN has positioned itself as the de-facto wireless access network for the 'last mile' connections. The potential for WLAN to deliver multimedia contents such as VoIP, video conferencing, streaming and data services will become a reality with the advent of 802.11n standard, promising data rate of up to 600Mbps. Although these QoS demanding multimedia applications can be supported by the 802.11e standard, it offers limited QoS guarantee. Further, its possible adoption by the industry remains unclear due to high cost of hardware replacements. In this paper, we give a solution to provision QoS support for multimedia traffic in commercially deployed 802.11a/b/g WLAN operating with fundamental distributed coordination function (DCF) access mechanism in a unifying QoS-inspired load optimization framework. We further postulate the notion of QoS balance as load criterion in heterogeneous WLANs where data rates and channel conditions are radically different. In practice, link adaptation employed to combat diverse channel conditions could lead to multirate operation and consequently the long-term throughput of stations are penalized by the lowest data rate peer. We argue that such rate anomaly can be mitigated by maintaining a QoS-balanced system. Simulations show that our solution provides service QoS guarantee for both real-time and non real-time traffic as well as achieves both throughput and QoS fairness under dynamic network conditions in a self-adjusting manner."
1112207,21212,8228,Implementing and evaluating improved MAC efficiency through payload extension in 802.11n networks,2013,"Currently, the default size of Internet packets is set at a legacy value of 1500 bytes, since Ethernet was the dominant connection technology. Increasing this size, and thus using larger frames, brings several advantages such as less header overhead and CPU processing. However, the transmission of larger frames also raises several issues impacting data transmission, such as packet loss. With the increase in performance gained from recent wireless technology advances, solutions, such as Frame Aggregation, begin to exploit this increased bandwidth. However, the legacy value is still the dominant one. This paper evaluates the feasibility of increasing the Maximum Transfer Unit for a more efficient data transfer and bandwidth consumption in wireless 802.11n networks. We focus particularly in the experimental implementation and evaluation of the usage of Jumbo-Frames between an Access Point and the connected nodes, featuring a modified kernel that allows the usage of larger payloads, via enhancements to the existing wireless kernel modules. Network performance parameters including bandwidth usage, delay and packet losses are used to assess the benefits and drawbacks of the usage of Jumbo Frames in the wireless medium. Obtained results show that a more efficient medium usage can be achieved by increasing the payload size, when compared with standardized aggregation mechanisms. In addition, the measured packet losses decrease due to a considerable reduction on the number of packets sent for the same bandwidth consumption. To conclude, we perform an evaluation of the proposed enhancement in wireless video streaming scenarios and evaluate the performance gains that such module enables."

Albeit this is achieved at the cost of requiring an increased transmit power, they are particularly beneficial, for example in cooperative communication scenarios, where the employment of channel estimation for all the mobile-to-mobile links may become unrealistic. In pursuit of high bandwidth efficiency, differential amplitude and phase shift keying (DAPSK) was devised using constellations of multiple concentric rings. In order to increase resilience against the typical high-Doppler-induced performance degradation of DAPSK and/or enhance the maximum achievable error-free transmission rate for DAPSK modulated systems, multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) may be invoked. However, the complexity of the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) MSDD increases exponentially with the detection window size and hence may become excessive upon increasing the window size, especially in the context of iterative detection aided channel coded system. In order to circumvent this excessive complexity, we conceive a decomposed two-stage iterative amplitude and phase (A/P) detection framework, where the challenge of having a non-constant-modulus constellation is tackled with the aid of a specifically designed information exchange between the independent A/P detection stages, thus allowing the incorporation of reduced-complexity sphere detection (SD). Consequently, a near-MAP-MSDD performance can be achieved at a significantly reduced complexity, which may be five orders of magnitude lower than that imposed by the traditional MAP-MSDD in the 16-DAPSK scenario considered."
2199612,21212,8228,AMNP: ad hoc multichannel negotiation protocol for multihop mobile wireless networks,2004,"Increasing the capacity of wireless communication is an open and interesting research area which has attracted much attention. The familiar solution is dividing the radio spectrum into several independent radio channels, which can be operated and accessed simultaneously by all nodes within its radio transmitting power. All solutions of researches adopt multiple transceivers to fulfil this goal. Nevertheless, these schemes will be short of implementation and may increase the prime cost since most wireless devices only equip one transceiver. Moreover, with a few exceptions, most researchers have emphasized centralized resource allocation algorithms for cellular systems where the base station keeps track of the requirements of the various users and is thus responsible for the management of network resources. However, on the other hand, multihop mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are generally configured as peer-to-peer networks with no centralized hubs or controllers. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a multichannel medium access control (MAC) protocol, named ad hoc multichannel negotiation protocol (AMNP), for multichannel transmission in distribution fashion. We address the issue of distributed resource allocation for multihop MANETs by presenting an AMNP that builds on the multichannel request-to-send/clear-to-send (MRTS/MCTS) bandwidth reservation mechanism under the constraint of single transceiver. We show via simulations that AMNP provides a higher throughput compared to its single channel counterpart by promoting simultaneous transmissions in different channels. Simulation results also show that the performance of proposed AMNP derives well than other multichannel approaches with multiple transceivers."
1310459,21212,8228,Internet routing diversity for stub networks with a Map-and-Encap scheme,2012,"Routing diversity has been identified as essential for network robustness and traffic engineering. The Internet possesses by its very nature a large path diversity. However this diversity cannot be fully exploited due to BGP limitations, which only keeps one single route for each available prefix. Despite some previous works in the area, no operational and non-disruptive architecture have been proposed yet to allow the networks to better exploit Internet path diversity. This paper proposes one step in this direction, focusing on the interconnection between an Autonomous System (AS) and its Internet Service Provider (ISP). We propose the use of a so-called “Map-and-Encap” scheme to bypass current BGP limitations in order to use arbitrary paths. With this scheme, an ISP may propose its rich path diversity (at least partially) to its customers, in order to perform advanced traffic engineering (e.g. fast recovery, load balancing…) based on richer and more flexible path selection policies (e.g., considering price, performance or stability of routes). To assess the potential benefits of the proposed architecture, we evaluate the potential route diversity that a Tier 1 may offer to its stub clients, based on different possible route selection policies (i.e. which routes are offered to its customers). We also analyze the overhead that is created at the control-plane (routing updates received by the mapping database) and that may impact the data-plane (path changes that may be caused by some route withdrawals/updates). Our evaluation shows that the increase in diversity has a controllable and acceptable overhead. It also gives some insights into efficient deployment strategies."
2462105,21212,8228,Noncoherent decorrelative multiuser detection for nonlinear nonorthogonal modulation,1997,"Coherent multiuser detection for linear modulation has been the subject of intense research in the past decade. Noncoherent detection for linear differentially phase shift keyed modulation has also received considerable attention in recent years. This paper considers for the first time the problem of noncoherent multiuser detection for M-ary nonlinear nonorthogonal modulation in the synchronous Gaussian channel. A key idea proposed here is that of a noncoherent decorrelative front end for nonlinear modulation. Like its counterpart in linear modulation, that front-end eliminates multiuser interference and reduces the multiuser detection problem into that of single-user detection over an equivalent (noise-enhanced) single-user channel. However, the M effective signals of the equivalent single-user channel are correlated and of unequal energy. Noncoherent detection even in this single-user channel has been an open problem until now. We derive the optimum detector for this channel. It is unfortunately too complicated to implement or analyze. Two suboptimal detectors are hence proposed depending on whether the energies of the M signals are known or unknown at the receiver. For unknown energies, the generalised likelihood ratio test leads to a detector which is easy to implement. Error probability bounds are obtained for this detector. It is shown to be near-far resistant (in contrast to the conventional detector). For known energies, an asymptotic series expansion of a special function involved in the optimum noncoherent decision rule leads to the other suboptimum detector. Its analysis is more difficult but we nevertheless obtain exact expressions for error probability for binary modulation and bounds on error probability in the M-ary case. This detector can outperform the GLRT detector by a significant margin. Both detectors far outperform the conventional single-user detector."
2897512,21212,8228,Design of system-level simulation platform for 5G networks,2016,"The Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile communications systems have been proposed and researched globally, and are expected to be launched in 2020. Aside from diverse exciting air-interface innovations for 5G systems, the networking design plays the critically important role to support the massive mobile traffics. It is widely recognized that the core features of 5G networking lie in the heterogeneous accesses, which are not confined to coexistence of small and macro cells, but generalized to access over multiple air-interfaces with utterly different networking fashions, such as LTE-A and WLAN. The heterogeneous feature not only complicates the network design, but also imposes significant challenges in system-level simulations and evaluations. Lack of innovation in simulation techniques will no doubt slow down the evolving and standardization process of 5G systems. To tackle these problems, we in this paper present a novel design of system-level 5G simulation platform. The unique features of our design include two-fold. 1) Simultaneous simulation of different types of networks are supported. In particular, cellular networks run in a well time-aligned fashion while WiFi operates entirely based on asynchronous random access mechanism. 2) Our platform offers the simulation of concurrent transmissions over multiple radio-access technologies for each single user, supporting either single or multiple services. We elaborate on the core ideas of our design embedding the aforementioned features as well as the details for building the entire platform. We also discuss the future innovative efforts and directions in simulation techniques for 5G networks."
2844241,21212,8228,Challenges & solutions for above 6 GHz radio access network integration for future mobile communication systems,2016,"Mobile communication technology has been rapidly evolving ever since its first introduction in the late 1980s. The development witnessed is not just in the refinement of the radio access techniques, but also in the progression towards offering sophisticated features and services to the mobile phone users. To fulfill this ever-growing user demand and market trends, frequency ranges in millimeter wave bands are envisioned for wireless radio transmission. To respond to this trends, the EU-funded mmMAGIC project has been launched and its main objective is to design and develop radio access techniques operating in 6 – 100 GHz bands. When it comes to developing technologies for systems operating these frequency ranges, a major challenge encountered will be in terms of its radio access network integration. Unquestionably, issues at various aspects of physical layer design, channel modelling, architecture, network functions and deployment will be encountered; problems in multi-node and multi-antenna transceiver designs will surface as well. The work carried in this project will address those challenges and propose solutions; but additionally, measure its efficiency against the project specific KPIs set to meet the requirements of the operational future 5G systems. The main intention of this paper is to outline some of the challenges, more specifically to highlight the network integration challenges, and discuss some of its technical solutions. The primary purpose here is to focus towards integrated 5G technology, thereby opening further research avenues for the exploration of new and alternate frequency bands in the electromagnetic spectrum."
1181978,21212,8228,Optical wireless multispot diffusing: a MIMO configuration,2004,"Optical (infrared) wireless communications links offer an attractive solution for indoor applications. To enable terminal mobility and reduce temporal dispersion, a configuration known as multispot-diffusing (MSD) is used, which is a multiinput, multioutput (MIMO) architecture. In this configuration, a transmitter generates multiple narrow beams that get uniformly spread over a reflection surface accessible to a service area. A multibranch receiver with each branch having access to a diffusing spot (generated by transmitter) combines signals on its branches. This scheme creates multiple virtually ideal communications channels between a base station and terminals. This paper considers issues involved in the design of a transmitter-based holographic spot array generator. The generator produces equally-spaced diffusing spots on the room ceiling and/or walls. To overcome power limitation set by eye safety requirements, a receiver optical concentrator is proposed. Furthermore, to improve receiver signal-to-noise ratio, an optical filter that rejects optical noise is needed. Thus, functionally receiver branch optical front-end consists of an optical concentrator and an optical band-pass filter. A single holographic optical element, capable of performing both functions is proposed. Link performance is investigated by providing equivalent link model and comparing probability of error for a bare and a holographic receiver. From performance evaluations, our results show that it is possible to achieve an increase of 11 dB in the SNR and improve power budget by reducing the path loss by over 6 dB."
2324016,21212,8228,Survivable Optical Grid Dimensioning: Anycast Routing with Server and Network Failure Protection,2011,"Grids can efficiently deal with challenging computational and data processing tasks which cutting edge science is generating today. So-called e-Science grids cope with these complex task by deploying geographically distributed server infrastructure, interconnected by high speed networks. The latter benefit from optical technology, offering low latencies and high bandwidths, thus giving rise to so-called optical grids or lambda grids. In this paper, we address the dimensioning problem of such grids: how to decide how much server infrastructure to deploy, at which locations in a given topology, the amount of network capacity to provide and which routes to follow along them. Compared to earlier work, we propose an integrated solution solving these questions in an integrated way, i.e., we jointly optimize network and server capacity, and incorporate resiliency against both network and server failures. Assuming we are given the amount of resource reservation requests arriving at each network node (where a resource reservation implies to reserve both processing capacity at a server site, and a network connection towards it), we solve the problem of first choosing a predetermined number of server locations to use, and subsequently determine the routes to follow while minimizing resource requirements. In a case study on a meshed European network comprising 28 nodes and 41 links, we show that compared to classical (i.e. without relocation) shared path protection against link failures only, we can offer resilience against both single link and network failures by adding about 55% extra server capacity, and 26% extra wavelengths."
1977178,21212,8228,Adaptive Mixture-Based Neural Network Approach for Higher-Level Fusion and Automated Behavior Monitoring,2009,"A novel adaptive mixture-based neural network is presented for exploiting track data to learn normal patterns of motion behavior and detect deviations from normalcy. We have extended our prior approach by introducing multidimensional probability density components to represent class density using an adaptive mixture of such components. The number of components in the adaptive mixture algorithm, as well as the values of the parameters of the density components, is estimated from the data. The network utilizes a recursive version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to minimize the Kullback-Leibler information metric by means of stochastic approximation combined with a rule for creation of new components. Learning occurs incrementally in order to allow the system to take advantage of increasing amounts of data without having to take the system offline periodically to update models. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. In addition, the adaptive mixtures neural network classifies streaming track data as normal or deviant. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives by enabling a shift of operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our overall motion pattern learning approach learns behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce massive amounts of track data to a rich set of information regarding operator field of regard that supports rapid decision-making and timely response initiation."
1199899,21212,8228,Coping with physical attacks on random network structures,2014,"Communication networks are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods, as well as to physical attacks, such as an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack. Such real-world events happen at specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore, the geographical layout of the network determines the impact of such events on the network's physical topology in terms of capacity, connectivity, and flow. #R##N#Recent works focused on assessing the vulnerability of a deterministic network to such events. In this work, we focus on assessing the vulnerability of (geographical) random networks to such disasters. We consider stochastic graph models in which nodes and links are probabilistically distributed on a plane, and model the disaster event as a circular cut that destroys any node or link within or intersecting the circle. #R##N#We develop algorithms for assessing the damage of both targeted and non-targeted (random) attacks and determining which attack locations have the expected most disruptive impact on the network. Then, we provide experimental results for assessing the impact of circular disasters to communications networks in the USA, where the network's geographical layout was modeled probabilistically, relying on demographic information only. Our results demonstrates the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios. #R##N#Our algorithms allows to examine how valuable is public information about the network's geographical area (e.g., demography, topography, economy) to an attacker's destruction assessment capabilities in the case the network's physical topology is hidden or examine the affect of hiding the actual physical location of the fibers on the attack strategy. Thereby, our schemes can be used as a tool for policy makers and engineers to design more robust networks and identifying locations which require additional protection efforts."
840628,21212,8228,Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) adaptive estimation and prediction schemes using superimposed and decomposed channel tracking,2013,"Performance of future wireless technologies will depend heavily on cooperation between different transmission/reception nodes in the access network. CoMP (Coordinated Multi-Point) transmission increases the cell edge user performance by reducing the inter-cell interference. UEs (User Equipments) simultaneously receive data from multiple base stations (eNBs) grouped into a joint transmission cluster. Clustering choices need to be optimized by joint use of CoMP adaptive channel estimation and prediction schemes for energy efficiency and capacity improvements. In this paper, various multi-point (multi-eNB) channel estimation/prediction schemes are proposed and analyzed to improve the joint transmission set clustering accuracy. Multi-point CIRs (Channel Impulse Responses) can be tracked either by superimposed or decomposed methods. The latter scheme tracks each multipath component of every CoMP measurement set member and yields more accurate estimates, however leads to significantly higher computation complexity as opposed to the superimposed tracking which tracks the overall CIR. Therefore, UEs need to dynamically switch between the two schemes depending on the serving cluster size and recently observed CoMP characteristics. It is shown that increasing the channel estimation/prediction filter size yields significantly more capacity and energy efficiency improvements for UEs served by larger clusters. It is also demonstrated that the serving eNB can maximize the performance gains by setting the channel prediction range equal to observed system delay between the multi-point CSI reports and data transmission."
1983434,21212,8228,Traceroute-Based Topology Inference without Network Coordinate Estimation,2008,"Underlay topology information is important to construct efficient overlay networks. To achieve end-to-end network topology inference among a group of hosts, traceroute-like tools are often used. Previously, Max-Delta has been proposed to infer a highly accurate topology with a low number of traceroutes. However, Max-Delta relies on external tools to estimate host coordinates, which incur considerable deployment overhead. In this paper, we consider novel inference schemes with no coordinate estimation. One choice is to select long paths to traceroute. That is, based on existing traceroute results, each host can estimate the distance between another host and itself. It can then select the host with the largest distance between them as the traceroute target. We call this scheme Longest-Path-First (LPF). Similarly, we can define Shortest-Path-First (SPF) inference. The intuition may indicate that LPF performs better than SPF, as longer paths often contain more underlay links and routers, and hence more undiscovered links or routers. However, our simulation results on Internet-like topologies show that SPF can achieve comparable performance with Max-Delta, while LPF performs even worse than a random inference scheme. To explain the results, we analyze the statistics of all-pairs paths between hosts. Our results show that long paths have serious overlaps on underlay links, showing much higher path stress than short paths. We also find that there exist quite a few links only appearing in short paths and seldom appearing in long paths. Therefore, with the same number of traceroutes, SPF can discover more underlay links and routers than LPF. Furthermore, as SPF prefers short paths, a traceroute in SPF sends less probing packets and consumes less network resource than that in LPF. Therefore, SPF is a highly efficient inference scheme with low deployment overhead and low measurement overhead."
2431955,21212,8228,Adaptive Beam Clustering Optical Wireless System for An Indoor Channel,2007,"The separating distance between the transceivers is one of the main factors that affect the quality of the received optical signal as the receiver changes locations in an optical wireless (OW) system. A beam clustering method was proposed to improve the indoor OW channel's performance by combating the degrading effects of multipath reflections. The method involved transmitting binary data bits over two other clusters of beams aimed at walls in addition to the one aimed at the ceiling. In this work, we investigate a novel approach to further improve the signal quality on reception using a proposed adaptive transmitter composed of three spot diffusing sub-transmitters aimed at the same three directions as in the beam clustering method. The receiver communicates with the transmitter and sends tap weights (for transmit powers) to be used by the sub-transmitters which optimises the signal reception based on the initial received pulses at different locations. Performance comparison with results of a non adaptive transmitter system is presented in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), delay spread (DS) and path loss distributions for two receiver types: 1) a single detector wide field-of-view (FOV) receiver and 2) a multi-detector angle diversity receiver. Our results show a significant improvement achieved with an SNR gain of 18 dB compared with the conventional diffuse system and a 6 dB SNR gain without transmitter adaptability. Therefore, at the expense of moderate computations, the use of an adaptive multi-beam clustering transmitter is promising and can enhance the optical signal reception to suit user mobility requirements."
2062214,21212,8228,Efficient Search Algorithms in the Presence of Measurement Uncertainty,2008,"In this work, we study the problem of efficient resource selection in real-time distributed systems. Specifically, we study how a client in the presence of measurement uncertainty can rapidly select a resource (target) that exhibits good network connectivity. The problem has many applications, including peer selection in P2P systems, server/gateway selection in IP telephony, and overlay routing. A probing-based search strategy is complicated by the potentially large number of targets and the inherent uncertainty in measurement results due to, for instance, small measurement sample sizes and other forms of noise. We parameterize the problem based on the number of available targets, the number of good targets, and various network characteristics. We introduce a framework called spatial slow start (SSS) for searching the target space. SSS can be considered as a parameterized tree search with an interesting twist: apart from the target search space, the rate of probing per target is also manipulated at each step. A detailed simulation study provides insight on what SSS choices are significant under different network conditions. The simulation study also establishes that previously proposed techniques, namely, a random selection (RAND) algorithm that does not do any probing, and a quick probe and select the best (QPS) technique work well, but only in some situations. Based on these insights, we present an adaptive SSS algorithm that not only guides the search process according to its measurements of various system parameters, but also changes its search parameters in response to the quality of the measurements themselves. This new adaptive SSS algorithm performs as well as RAND and QPS in situations where RAND and QPS are efficient, and outperforms them in other cases."
523122,21212,8228,Infrastructure density and frequency reuse for user-deployed wireless LAN systems at 17 GHz in an office environment,2001,"Wireless LANs (WLANs) are becoming increasingly popular in modern offices. Network operators start now offering wireless access via WLANs also in public places. Systems usually operate at 2.4 or 5 GHz. Propagation properties in these frequency bands allow relatively large cells. A high frequency reuse is normally applied to limit co-channel interference, however it also reduces the spectral efficiency of the network. In the 17 GHz band, which is also proposed for operating WLANs, propagation conditions should allow tighter reuse, hence a better spectral efficiency and higher capacities. In this paper, we sketch a system design for the 17 GHz band in order to study the infrastructure density required for achieving coverage and to evaluate the spectral efficiency of the network. Simulation results in a typical office setting show that data rates of 100 Mbps can be achieved with a reuse factor of 6 and a moderate number of wireless access points (APs). Network installation costs could be considerably reduced if the need for coverage planning can be eliminated and the wiring of the APs simplified. This is achieved with the proposed user-deployment approach, where customers set up the APs themselves according to some basic rules. We show that this method achieves adequate performance and hence that the network is relatively insensitive to the actual positioning of the APs, provided suitable antennas are used. Hence, low-cost network deployment is feasible without significantly deteriorating the coverage or lowering the achievable data rates."
2538292,21212,8228,Low-Weight Channel Coding for Interference Mitigation in Electromagnetic Nanonetworks in the Terahertz Band,2011,"Nanotechnology is providing the engineering community with a new set of tools to design and manufacture integrated devices just a few hundred nanometers in total size. Communication among these nano-devices will boost the range of applications of nanotechnology in several fields, ranging from biomedical research to military technology or environmental science. Within the different alternatives for communication in the nanoscale, recent developments in nanomaterials point to the Terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) as the frequency range of operation of future electromagnetic nano-transceivers. This frequency band can theoretically support very large bit-rates in the short range, i.e., for distances below one meter. Due to the limited capabilities of individual nano-devices, pulse-based communications have been proposed for electromagnetic nanonetworks in the Terahertz band. However, the expectedly very large number of nano-devices and the unfeasibility to coordinate them, can make interference a major impairment for the system. In this paper, low-weight channel coding is proposed as a novel mechanism to reduce interference in pulse-based nanonetworks. Rather than utilizing channel codes to detect and correct transmission errors, it is shown that by appropriately choosing the weight of a code, interference can be mitigated. The performance of the proposed scheme is analytically and numerically investigated both in terms of overall interference reduction and achievable information rate, by utilizing a new statistical interference model. The results show that this type of network-friendly channel coding schemes can be used to alleviate the interference problem in nanonetworks without compromising the individual user information rate."
2328784,21212,8228,WATMnet: a prototype wireless ATM system for multimedia personal communication,1996,"A prototype microcellular wireless ATM network (WATMnet) capable of providing integrated multimedia communication services to mobile terminals is described in this paper. The experimental system's hardware consists of laptop computers (NEC Versa-M) with WATMnet interface cards, multiple VME/i960 processor-based WATMnet base stations, and a mobility-enhanced local-area ATM switch. The prototype wireless network interface cards operate at peak bit-rates up to 8 Mbps, using low-power 2.4 GHz ISM-band modems. Wireless network protocols at the portable terminal and base station interfaces support ABR, VBR and CBR transport services compatible with ATM using a dynamic TDMA/TDD MAC protocol for channel sharing and data link control (DLC) protocol for error recovery. A custom wireless control protocol is also implemented between the portable and base units for support of radio link related functions such as user registration and handoff. All network entities including the portable, base and switch use a mobility-enhanced version of ATM (Q.2931+) signaling for switched virtual circuit (SVC) connection control functions, including handoff. Early experiments with the WATMnet prototype have been conducted to validate major protocol and software aspects, including DLC, wireless control and mobility signaling for handoff.

2413821,21212,8228,DiffServ Model with Backpressure for CDMA2000,2007,"The nodes with shared-queues at the CDMA2000 data network have inherent rate mismatch and a single level of service. A core node, the packet control function (PCF) is processing power limited. Whereas a feeding node, the packet data serving node (PDSN), has superior processing metrics. A close-loop backpressure solution was proposed at the literature to efficiently control the PCF queue by utilizing PDSN free buffer space during PCF congestion events. Differentiated services (DiffServ) have been designed for Internet to provide multiple levels of network services. We propose a model for providing service differentiation at the CDMA2000 data networks. The model aims to provide service differentiations comparable to the traditional DiffServ model. The proposed improvement is in providing those services under the CDMA2000 structure of tandem nodes with large rate mismatch and a constraint of maintaining the complexity level of the processing limited core node (the PCF). The model uses a combination of backpressure and DiffServ techniques. The backpressure mechanism is used to push congestion from the PCF to the PDSN edge node where superior treatment of differentiated services can be provided to the traffic. The model differentiates services in terms of the relative access to the output link bandwidth and provides distinct handling to traffic at the multiple RED physical queues. It enables differentiation in terms of the achieved relative throughput, packet loss rate, delay, and jitter. We demonstrate the solution's robustness with various traffic scenarios and system topologies. We show that our architecture is effective in providing bandwidth differentiation, as well as throughput, packet drop rate, and average delay preferences."

In C-RAN architecture, different access technology (eg.GSM / TD-SCDMA / WCDMA / LTE) can be support on the same hardware platform in baseband pool system; C-RAN can be applied to reduce the consumption of operators. LTE (Long Term Evolution) and LTE-A, which are based on OFDM and MIMO technologies, are regarded as the main wireless access technology in the evolution from 3G to 4G. LTE introduces variety of novel technologies to improve the system performance, especially in C-RAN architecture, such as Multi antennas MIMO, Carrier Aggregation, CoMP. However, C -RAN architecture also brings about lager data transmission in the optical fiber. In this paper a low-latency baseband signal compression algorithm used in ALU is introduced to reduce the data rate. Based on the Characteristics of LTE signal data, the algorithm removal redundancies in the spectral domain firstly, and then the block scaling, which is combined with non-linear (nonuniform) quantizer, is designed to minimize quantization error. This algorithm can effectively reduce the amount of data transferred between BBU and RUU in LTE system, to facilitate the deployment of LTE in the CRan architecture. Simulation analysis is given out in the paper; meanwhile TD-LTE system demo verification is also implemented. The results indicate that the scheme introduced can get good performance under a certain compression rate in the real system. Further research is also in progress."
1979253,21212,8228,Power allocation schemes for pilot symbol assisted modulation over Rayleigh fading channels with no feedback,2004,"In communication over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels, adaptive coded modulation for pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) without feedback has been shown to yield significant benefits in terms of achievable rates (M. Medard et al., 2000). This technique adapts transmission rate at the sender to the quality of the channel estimate at the receiver but keeps the mean power constant throughout. In this paper, we show that this adaptive PSAM scheme can be further improved if power and rate are jointly adapted to the quality of the measurement at the receiver. We study the optimal power distribution scheme and find it to apply the following principle: more power is allocated to symbols corresponding to better estimates at the receiver, while maintaining the average energy constraint satisfied within a period. We find that this simple scheme is optimal and performs better than adapting to channel quality using schemes akin to 'water filling'. Our model is a Rayleigh fading channel where time-variance is described by a Gauss-Markov model (M. Medard, 2000). The transmitter periodically sends pilot tones to measure the channel at the receiver. We interleave different codes, while maintaining the power constant over a codebook, and the average power over codebooks satisfying the constraint. Performance is quantified in terms of achievable rates. Our scheme does not require any real time computation or adaptation at the transmitter, and so comes at no extra cost with respect to (M. Meadard et al., 2000). When considering causal and non causal estimation strategies at the receiver, considerable improvement was attained without any added complexity."
2728975,21212,8228,Adaptive inter-cell interference cancellation in heterogeneous networks: Making smart use of multiple antennas at base stations,2015,"In downlink heterogeneous networks (HetNets), inter-cell interference management becomes more complicated and challenging than that in traditional homogeneous networks due to the coexistence of different types of base stations (BSs). Most existing interference management approaches, such as coordinated beamforming and joint transmission, require joint signal processing at a number of, if not all, BSs. The burden thus imposed on the backhaul network may be too heavy for practical systems. In this paper, we therefore propose a low-complexity inter-cell interference cancellation (ICIC) scheme, where each BS independently cancels its interference to a set of users in neighboring cells when transmitting to its own user. In particularly, the proposed ICIC scheme is implemented in two time-scales. In the slow time-scale, each BS is assigned to a set of users intended for ICIC, referred to as a nulling set, according to long-term statistics of the wireless channels. Then, in the fast time-scale, beamforming vectors are chosen at each BS to cancel its interference to the users in its nulling set based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). In this way, the overall system throughput is improved through slow adaptive assignment of nulling sets, while real-time signal processing is implemented locally at each BS. To assign nulling sets for BSs, we should carefully examine the trade-off between the gain from ICIC and the loss in the transmission diversity, such that the benefits of multiple antennas at BSs are exploited efficiently. To this end, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal assignment of nulling sets as an integer programming (IP), where the data rate is expressed as a function of the nulling set assignment. With the derived expression of the data rate, we develop a greedy algorithm to solve the IP efficiently. Simulation in a two-tier network shows that the proposed ICIC scheme can balance the data rates in pico and macro cells adaptively such that the total throughput is improved."
1915152,21212,8228,Distributed Cooperative Routing for UWB Ad-Hoc Networks,2007,"This conference paper proposes and investigates a new distributed cooperative routing strategy that can be adopted to forward data in the ultra wide band (UWB) ad-hoc network via a multi-hop route with the best instantaneous quality. The strategy combines the physical (PHY) and medium-access-control (MAC) layer mechanisms to select the best route from available ones in a cooperative and distributed way. Using an example of the parallel two-hop relay network where data from a source node can be forwarded by several possible relays to the destination node, we study two related issues: First, we devise a new estimation algorithm for the UWB link received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is used to determine the UWB link quality. The estimation algorithm is unbiased with estimation errors significantly lower than the reported algorithms in literature. Second, we propose a new distributed cooperative routing scheme. Each relay node uses an enhanced carrier sensing with deterministically mapped backoff period as the MAC protocol. The back-off period is chosen by each relay such that the higher the quality of the associated source-relay-destination route, the shorter the back-off time. Simulation results show that even without any feedback about the relay- destination link quality from the destination node to relays and using only its statistical information, the proposed scheme still has up to 3 dB improvement in performance as compared to the random routing. When having 1-bit such feedback, the proposed scheme can achieve full diversity and the overall performance is only 2 dB away from that with full-precision feedback."
2015736,21212,10228,On the performance of downstream traffic distribution scheme in fiber-wireless networks,2011,"Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks, have rapidly matured as a last mile Internet access network solution due to their novel combination of Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) as a backhaul and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) as an access network. The high bandwidth provided by the optical lines, as well as the flexibility offered by the wireless network, offers a great degree of cost-efficiency in terms of sharing an optical line with a number of simultaneous users. In a FiWi network, Gateways (GWs) located between the EPON and WMN serve both the function of an Optical Network Unit (ONU) in the EPON and a mesh router in WMN. Since all of the downstream from the EPON to the WMN and all of the upstream from the WMN to the EPON must be exchanged at GWs, traffic distribution technique between GWs is necessary to achieve efficient utilization of the network resources. Controlling the downstream traffic is a significant issue in preventing performance degradation due to network congestion at the GWs, because the bandwidth of WMN is generally narrower than that of the EPON. In addition, the number of hops from a GW to an end-user in the WMN needs to be taken into account in the traffic distribution process, because the increased number of hops results in lower communication efficiency due to mutual interferences between adjacent links and effects of cross traffic. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the downstream controlling of FiWi networks, and propose a traffic distribution scheme which utilizes an aspect of EPON to properly distribute traffic load among GWs. A hop count limitation mechanism is adopted to avoid throughput degradation caused by increased wireless interference and effects of cross traffic in the WMN. Simulation results show a trade-off relationship between fair load balancing among GWs and high throughput for end-users, and the proposed scheme can accommodate it by regulating hop count limitation."
2292152,21212,8228,Dimensioning of a Multi-Rate Network Transporting Variable Bit Rate TV Channels,2009,"We consider a centralised (client-server) digital TV network with heterogeneous receiver devices of different resolutions, requiring a multi-rate transport system. There exist two main ways to store and transport (streamed) TV channels in such a system: either by providing different single-layer versions of a channel (simulcast transport mode) or by keeping one multi-layered version (encoded e.g. in SVC) with extractable substreams.#R##N##R##N#We propose one approximate analytical and two simulation methods to estimate the capacity demand in such a network with variable bit rate channels and we consider two behaviour models. In some TV distribution networks, the video is delivered in constant bit rate. However, this implies that the video quality is varying. In order to provide better quality of service (QoS), a network operator must deliver the channels in non-constant bit rate aiming in this way at constant video quality. Our models take into account also the correlations between the different resolutions of a channel.#R##N##R##N#Starting from real experimental data, we obtain the necessary input to our models and explore two realistic TV network scenarios - with bouquets of 50 and 300 channels, respectively. The results by the three approaches correspond well (relative error of 0.5% at most). In the case of 50 channels, SVC outperforms simulcast in terms of required bandwidth, while in the case of 300 channels, SVC is outperformed by simulcast. Therefore, we conclude that it depends on the system parameters which of both transport strategies will be more beneficial to save network resources."
2503214,21212,8228,Measuring WCDMA and HSDPA Delay Characteristics with QoSMeT,2007,"Quality of service (QoS) is becoming increasingly important with the rise of multimedia applications (e.g., voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, online gaming, and Internet protocol television (IPTV)) in public data networks. These applications demand real-time service, while the networks should still be able to transfer also other traffic reliably (e.g., data, e- mail, WWW). We have developed a measurement tool, which is able to measure one-way QoS performance statistics. The tool enables passive monitoring of the desired application(s) and gives information about the QoS provided by the network. The tool can be used practically over any kind of network structure as long as IP is supported. In this paper, we focus on detailed end-to-end delay characteristics measured in live HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access) enabled 3G network. HSDPA provides clearly better delay performance than the basic WCDMA (wideband code division multiple access). Interestingly, deterministic long time behavior in delay was observed, and also, discrete jitter levels were found. With argumentation, and finally with a trial, we proved that these phenomena originate from the CBR-type (constant bit rate) VoIP source traffic affecting with 3G network timing mechanisms and mutual clock drifts. As a side product, the study also showed that it is advisable to verify the operation of traffic generation tools before using them."
2309490,21212,8228,Impact of smart grid traffic peak loads on shared LTE network performance,2013,"The purpose of the paper is to examine if public long term evolution (LTE) network is suitable for smart grid (SG) automatic metering usage, in a suburban scenario, without causing significant hindrance to typical LTE traffic. In addition, the same generalized suburban scenario is evaluated with a hybrid sensor - LTE network where wireless sensor network (WSN) cluster heads are also equipped with LTE remote terminal units (RTUs). The simulation topology is formed as a suburban area that consists of single RTU per apartment/house for SG traffic and an average 3.7 people per habitat, each with their user equipment, using one of the available carriers. Normal SG traffic is generated in both directions, uplink and downlink. The worst-case usage factor is considered as a power outage, where all SG meters in the area of influence simultaneously detect and attempt to report such a failure. Thus, emergency SG traffic is generated simultaneous by all RTUs. To alleviate the problem of the high momentary SG emergency traffic load, two distinct solutions are proposed and simulated. As the first solution, an artificial, up to one-second random delay is introduced in the transmission scheduling of emergency messages. The second solution applies low-power WSNs at the cluster level and cluster heads that contain both 802.15.4 and LTE communication interfaces, i.e., a hybrid sensor-LTE network. The simulation results show that both of the solutions that try to alleviate the high instantaneous traffic loads can reach the quality of service criteria for SG traffic without compromising other public LTE traffic. The deciding factor to use either pure LTE approach or a hybrid sensor-LTE network comes from non-functional requirements of the system."
418743,21212,8228,Performance of simple and Smart PHY/MAC mechanisms for Body Area Networks,2015,"Measuring the living condition and health status of users using small sensing devices and collecting the data of each user over wireless networks is expected to be a new trend in healthcare. Body Area Network (BAN) is an emerging area of personal data communications that will facilitate the capture of data and its collection. Although the IEEE 802.15.6 standard for wireless body area networks was created for this purpose, it is very complex and is unsuitable for ultra low power sensors. A new BAN specification, under the Technical Committee (TC) on SmartBAN, is now being considered in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) targeting ultra low power devices. Some of the technical requirements of the new Smart BAN system includes ultra-low power consumption, coexistence with other wireless systems, a timely access mechanism and optimum control of quality of service (QoS) for emergency signals. A simple and energy efficient MAC/PHY system has been proposed by the authors as part of the ETSI TC Smart BAN specifications. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate our proposed Smart BAN system which is based on two channels, a control channel and a data channel. The control channel is used for announcements from which both nodes and neighboring hubs are able to gather information for use in co-existence algorithms as well as for initial connection setup. Our proposed system uses simple time division multiple access (TDMA) in the data channel so that the power consumption of nodes is kept low. A shared access mechanism has also been proposed to reduce the latency of emergency signals. We evaluate the access delay and power consumption of our system in this paper, and show that the proposed shared access mechanism reduces the latency of emergency signals."
2837531,21212,8228,Dynamic range aware LTE uplink P0 optimization in HetNet,2016,"Power control is essential for uplink multi-user access of Long Term Evolution (LTE). It guarantees that the received uplink power is kept within reasonable dynamic range such that the weak signals from large distance users do not get lost due to limited resolution of the eNB's Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Capacity optimization of the open loop power control (OLPC) parameter P0 is applicable cell-individually for Macro deployments but fails in combination with small cells using the same frequency carrier, i.e. in heterogeneous networks (HetNet). In this paper, we show that an autonomous cell-individual Self-Optimizing-Network (SON) algorithm using cell internal optimization criteria like power headroom (PHR) reports and receive power dynamic range to increase P0 leads to good performance in macro-only layout. However, for co-channel HetNet deployment with embedded pico cells the inter-cell interference among the layers must be taken into account by means of propagation information exchange. We present a novel enhanced HetNet SON approach for P0 optimization where P0 value for a pico is calculated based on network configuration and the path loss of the weak macro cell-edge User Equipments (UEs) Lmax. The results show that approach can limit the P0 at safe level when pico cell could cause too much inter-cell interference to macro cell and on the other hand has higher limits when pico cell UEs are not interfering macro cell. This method offers a simple way to boost uplink capacity in macro and HetNet layouts while taking the uplink dynamic range and inter-cell interference into account."
2346332,21212,8228,3G/HSPA Performance in Live Networks from the End User Perspective,2009,"Operators around the world are improving their 3G/UMTS networks by introducing HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) that includes both, enhanced uplink and downlink. The HSPA is expected to finally provide the mobile broadband access that is able to compete with the fixed connections in performance regarding popular applications such as web browsing, VoIP, and video. However, it has remained unclear how well the live networks fulfill the promises of performance. We contribute in filling this void by providing measurements in live 3G/HSPA networks. We compare TCP and UDP goodput performance in basic WCDMA, HSDPA-only, and HSPA. Moreover, one-way delay and jitter measurement results are presented in a stationary as well as in a mobile scenario.#R##N##R##N#The results show that the enhanced network outperforms clearly its predecessor by offering considerably higher data rates, lower delay, and lower jitter. Also, because of the HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat request), there are notably less delay spikes observed with HSPA than with WCDMA. However, the drive tests show that handovers result in high jitter and interruptions to the communications, which causes, e.g., decreased VoIP call quality. The uplink enhancement (HSUPA) improves the TCP performance beyond the HSDPA-only access, but it is still behind that of the fixed connections. In addition, the properties of the channel allocation mechanism still considerably deteriorate the data rates seen by the user. Nevertheless, the HSPA is an enabler for true mobile broadband internet access."
1292574,21212,369,Energy Efficiency and Capacity Evaluation of LTE-Advanced Downlink CoMP Schemes Subject to Channel Estimation Errors and System Delay,2013,"Due to the increased energy consumption of cellular access networks, energy efficiency of the systems should be considered jointly with spectral efficiency to obtain the overall performance metrics and trade-offs. Downlink coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission aided cell switch off schemes can mitigate inter-cell interference and increase energy efficiency by using the active cells to serve the users in the switched off cell. However, the performance of this newly proposed scheme is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the selected CoMP joint transmission set. In this paper, we model the multi-point channel estimation enabled via channel state information reference symbols (CSI-RS) introduced in 3GPP release 10 systems and simulate possible scenarios that would lead to inaccurate transmission set clustering: multi-point channel estimation errors and possible CoMP system delays due to CSI transfers, node processing delays and network topology limitations. In order to mitigate the effects of channel estimation errors and system delay, we propose a framework for multi- point channel estimation in CoMP systems using a time-varying interpolation filter which tracks each multipath delay tap separately for every measured point. Possible performance gains with different filter lengths are demonstrated. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In addition, proof of concept is provided for CoMP adaptive time-varying multi-point estimation filter designs, where the UEs which are being served by higher cluster degrees need to enlarge the estimation filter memory spans only for the points which are more likely to be included in the joint transmission set."
2819603,21212,8228,Path loss channel models for 5G cellular communications in Riyadh city at 60 GHz,2016,"This paper presents propagation path loss channel models developed from real-field measurement campaigns that were conducted in indoor and outdoor Line-of-Site (LOS) propagation environments in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia, using highly directional antennas at 60 GHz. The setup used in these measurements emulates the future fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems for both access and backhaul services, as well as for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. We used our measurement data to develop the corresponding large-scale propagation path loss models at 60 GHz, using the log-distance and the floating intercept modeling approaches. It is shown that cellular radio links can be established in short-range distances up to 134 m indoors, and up to 77 m outdoors, when employing highly directional antennas at both the transmitter and receiver sides. It is also shown that path loss at 60 GHz in hot and sunny weather during the day, is higher than those obtained in cool and clear weather at night. This is partly due to solar radio noise effect arising from the intense solar radiation that characterizes summer afternoon in Riyadh city, which can cause a decrease in carrier-to-noise ratio at the input of receiving antennas. It is also partly due to the increase in thermal noise when electronics components in the measurement device become hot. The results presented here are thus very useful in 5G cellular design and infrastructure planning in the gulf region, where daytime temperature could reach 43° C or more."
1072347,21212,369,28 GHz Angle of Arrival and Angle of Departure Analysis for Outdoor Cellular Communications Using Steerable Beam Antennas in New York City,2013,"Propagation measurements at 28 GHz were conducted in outdoor urban environments in New York City using four different transmitter locations and 83 receiver locations with distances of up to 500 m. A 400 mega- chip per second channel sounder with steerable 24.5 dBi horn antennas at the transmitter and receiver was used to measure the angular distributions of received multipath power over a wide range of propagation distances and urban settings. Measurements were also made to study the small-scale fading of closely-spaced power delay profiles recorded at half-wavelength (5.35 mm) increments along a small-scale linear track (10 wavelengths, or 107 mm) at two different receiver locations. Our measurements indicate that power levels for small- scale fading do not significantly fluctuate from the mean power level at a fixed angle of arrival. We propose here a new lobe modeling technique that can be used to create a statistical channel model for lobe path loss and shadow fading, and we provide many model statistics as a function of transmitter- receiver separation distance. Our work shows that New York City is a multipath-rich environment when using highly directional steerable horn antennas, and that an average of 2.5 signal lobes exists at any receiver location, where each lobe has an average total angle spread of 40.3° and an RMS angle spread of 7.8°. This work aims to create a 28 GHz statistical spatial channel model for future 5G cellular networks."
476212,21212,8228,MPLS DiffServ-Enabled Traffic Engineering: A Scalable QoS Model for Optical-Speed Media Streaming Networks,2004,"The rapid growth of the Internet and the widespread deployment of networks built around the Internet Protocol suite are creating a demand for new capabilities in IP networks. In order to support the multitude of emerging multimedia applications such as streaming video, voice over IP, distance learning and other real-time services, it is necessary for the Internet to support, in addition to best-effort service, proper service-level agreements that guarantee a specified level of throughput, timing and network reliability, irrespective of the usage level and individual network failures. In detail, multimedia applications with real-time properties require tight guarantees in terms of delay, delay variation (jitter), bandwidth, packet loss, and availability that usually identify some service classes and specify the forwarding treatment, in term of QoS due to traffic belonging to each service class. To meet these requirements, the network must be enhanced with new technologies that offer adequate capabilities for controlling its behavior. Together, the capabilities offered by the combination of Differentiated Services and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) enhance the ability of the network operator to control the network to deliver service according to the performance, QoS and scalability needs of the near future delay-sensitive multimedia networking applications. This paper presents and evaluates a complete framework of MPLS DiffServ facilities for deployment of performance-aware multimedia streaming networks."
1091605,21212,8228,Scene change detection-based Discrete Autoregressive modeling for MPEG-4 video traffic,2013,"With more than 16 billion videos streamed on YouTube during last May and recent estimates by Cisco that mobile video traffic will increase 25-fold between 2011 and 2016, there is a pressing need to adequately serve large numbers of simultaneous online video transmissions. Network providers need to be able to guarantee the strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of real-time variable bit rate (VBR) video users, and a good statistical model for multiplexed video traffic can help significantly to evaluate and enhance network performance under various video loads. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new hybrid video traffic model for MPEG-4 video. The genres of the videos considered in our study include lectures, cartoons, talk shows, action movies, sci-fi and sports. In the first part of our work, we build a Discrete Autoregressive model of order one (DAR(1)) and discuss its efficiency on capturing the behavior of real MPEG-4 video traces. We then proceed to build and evaluate a hybrid model which combines the DAR(1) model with a scene-change detection and classification algorithm, in order to provide us with higher modeling accuracy. The classification is performed based on the average number of bits generated during the scenes and the scene activity is modeled by a Markov chain where each state represents the degree of activity (high/low). Our extensive experimental evaluation study shows that the proposed hybrid method significantly improves the efficiency of pure DAR(1) schemes."
2039543,21212,8228,Routing and rate allocation to provide end-to-end delay guarantees under PGPS scheduling,2001,"This paper considers the problem of routing sessions with quality of service (QoS) requirements in a network under packet generalized processor sharing (PGPS) scheduling. PGPS is a non-preemptive scheduling policy that tracks GPS. The GPS policy operates by allocating a weight /spl phi//sub n//sup m/ for a session n whose traffic uses link m. These weights determine the rate at which the traffic from session n is served at link m and the rate in turn determines the end-to end delay of packets belonging to session n. As a deterministic and easily computable end-to-end delay bound is available for locally stable sessions, we consider the locally stable regime in this paper. Two separate problems are considered in this paper. The first problem deals with the practically important inverse procedure of specifying appropriate weights for sessions at each link on their paths, that satisfy predetermined delay bounds, when the set of sessions to be routed is given. Here we show that the fixed routing case can be formulated as a linear program (LP) and the adaptive routing case can be formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The second problem examines the performance of PGPS scheduling policy when providing per-session QoS guarantees. We measure the performance in terms of weighted carried traffic. We derive an upper bound on the weighted carried traffic for any heuristic algorithm for admission control that operates within the locally stable domain. This upper bound can be obtained by computing a linear program (LP). By simulating a simple heuristic algorithm for admission control, we show that this upper bound is reasonably tight. Hence our upper bound can be used as a metric against which the performance of different algorithms can be compared."
312172,21212,8228,Random neural network based power controller for inter-cell interference coordination in LTE-UL,2015,"This paper presents an application of cognitive networking paradigm to the problem of inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) in Long-Term Evolution-Uplink (LTE-UL). We describe state-of-the-art, research challenges involved, and a novel random neural network (RNN) based power controller and interference management framework. The RNN based cognitive engine (CE) learns how the electromagnetic environment is affecting the reliability of communication and can therefore dynamically selects the optimal transmit power for serving users and the users' served by neighbouring cells. The presented CE model has features such as better generalization, fast calculation in run-time, and easy hardware/software implementation. These three features are essential for the development of any real-time cognitive communication system and most of the existing artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based solutions lack them. To achieve the best learning capability, performance evaluation of four learning algorithms (gradient descent (GD), adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization (AIW-PSO), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA)) are applied to RNN and analysed. The analysis showed that AIW-PSO outperformed all other algorithms in terms of both learning and prediction accuracy but with slight compromise on computational complexity and training speed as compared to GD, whereas DE and GA had low performance. Therefore, AIW-PSO based RNN framework is the optimal choice for presented system model."
1897726,21212,8228,BPSK-like Methods for Hybrid-Search Acquisition of Galileo Signals,2006,"The Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation which has been proposed for future Galileo and GPS M-code signals, provides a higher spectral separation from BPSK-modulated signals, such as GPS C/A code. The absolute value of the auto-correlation function of a BOC signal has a narrower main lobe, which may increase the resolution of delay estimates, but also presents deep fades, which may lead to a higher number of timing hypotheses to acquire the signal. In order to get rid of these ambiguities, several approaches have been proposed in literature, which provide an unambiguous BPSK-like shape of correlation function. In this paper we analyze, compare and develop further two BPSK-like methods which allow to acquire a BOC-signal unambiguously. The focus is on hybrid search, where several time-frequency bins are searched in parallel. We introduce here a modified version of a BPSK-like method which decreases the receiver complexity and is valid for both odd and even BOC orders. We analyze both single-side band (SSB) processing (i.e., only one band is used) and dual-side band (DSB) processing (i.e., upper and lower bands are combined non-coherently). While eliminating the ambiguities in auto-correlation function, both SSB and DSB processing present some performance degradation, induced by the band selection and non-coherent processing. The analysis is done in the presence of multipath fading channels. As a benchmark, we keep also the ambiguous BOC processing. We consider parameters specified in the proposals for Galileo system Open Service (OS), respectively Publicly Regulated Service (PRS)."
2050711,21212,8228,Interference Aware Medium Access in Cellular OFDMA/TDD Networks,2006,"In this paper a novel decentralized and interference aware medium access control (MAC) protocol combined with a dynamic subchannel selection algorithm for OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) is presented. The protocol resolves several drawbacks of the existing radio resource allocation techniques for OFDM systems, such as the hidden and exposed node problem, and the requirement for a time-invariant channel. The proposed scheme enables the transmitter to determine the level of interference it would cause to already active links prior to any transmission. This is achieved through a busyslot signaling that exploits the channel reciprocity offered by the TDD mode. Compared to existing radio resource allocation schemes the required signaling overhead is significantly reduced. The interference awareness allows the system to avoid significant co-channel interference (CCI) and to operate with full frequency reuse. When applied to a broadband OFDM air interface, this principle can also exploit the frequency selective fading channel on the intended as well as the interference links. This results in an autonomous subcarrier allocation algorithm which can dynamically adapt to time-varying channels. Due to its decentralized nature, the algorithm can be utilized in both cellular and ad hoc networks. Simulation results for a cellular system show that the new decentralized medium access and channel assignment algorithm is capable of achieving spectral efficiencies of up to 2.25 bits/Hz/cell using 16 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation)."
2261085,21212,8228,A model for estimating installed first costs of NGPN translation in PCS systems,1997,"Future wired networks with an ATM backbone will need to support PCS and wireless subscriber services. One of the key functions required to support PCS and wireless subscribers with non-geographic phone numbers (NGPN) will be the ability to efficiently identify which home location register (HLR) database serves the subscriber. (Note that the same functionality is also needed to serve subscribers with portable phone numbers.) In a previous paper we have presented a scheme for NGPN translation based upon distributed, dynamic hashing. The scheme uses a hash function in the visitor location registers (VLR) and a set of distributed translation servers (TS) which store the NGPN-to-HLR mapping. We develop a simplified model for estimating the capital investment cost of deploying the NGPN translation scheme we have proposed. The model focuses on the incremental cost of providing NGPN service by estimating the installed first cost (IFC) of deploying TSs. The cost model assumes that PCS subscribers adopt NGPNs following the classic Fisher-Pry model of technological adoption, and takes into account user mobility, caching, the projected growth in the performance of computing servers, and projected decline in their cost, as well as inflation, the time value of money, and population growth. The cost model is fully parameterized, allowing network planners to substitute appropriate values to evaluate what-if scenarios. We illustrate its use for an example scenario. We also point out that the cost model itself is quite generic and may be applicable to other network costing and operations planning tasks."
1066225,21212,8228,Two-stage channel feedback for beamforming and scheduling in network MIMO systems,2012,"This paper proposes an efficient two-stage beamforming and scheduling algorithm for the limited-feedback cooperative multi-point (CoMP) systems. The system includes multiple base-stations cooperatively transmitting data to a pool of users, which share a rate-limited feedback channel for sending back the channel state information (CSI). The feedback mechanism is divided into two stages that are used separately for scheduling and beamforming. In the first stage, the users report their best channel gain from all the base-station antennas and the basestations schedule the best user for each of their antennas. The scheduled users are then polled in the second stage to feedback their quantized channel vectors. The paper proposes an analytical framework to derive the bit allocation between the two feedback stages and the bit allocation for quantizing each user's CSI. For a total number of feedback bits B, it is shown that the number of bits assigned to the second feedback stage should scale as log B. Furthermore, in quantizing channel vectors from different base-stations, each user should allocate its feedback budget in proportion to the logarithm of the corresponding channel gains. These bit allocation are then used to show that the overall system performance scales double-logarithmically with B and logarithmically with the transmit SNR. The paper further presents several numerical results to show that, in comparison with other beamforming-scheduling algorithms in the literature, the proposed scheme provides a consistent improvement in downlink sum rate and network utility. Such improvements, in particular, are achieved in spite of a significant reduction in the beamforming-scheduling computational complexity, which makes the proposed scheme an attractive solution for practical system implementations."
2873378,21212,10228,A new approach for routing plane construction in future multi-plane routing based wireless IP access networks,2016,"There has been a rapid rise in the IP traffic throughout the Internet which takes advantage of the already established widespread IP infrastructure. Different suggestions are being explored to facilitate the next-generation access networks via IP mechanisms, with a growing trend towards a flat-IP structure and novel topological set-ups in the backhaul. Aligned with this evolution, there are increasingly more user applications flooding the Internet that calls for a consistent routing strategy to minimize loss in data transmission. In this paper, Multi-Plane Routing (MPR), which incorporates various aspects in all-IP infrastructure will be studied under the new access network structure. MPR is based on Multi-Topology Open Shortest Path First (MT-OSPF) principle and divides the physical network topology into several logical Routing Planes (RPs). The offline Traffic Engineering (TE) strategy for MPR has been optimized using a heuristic hop-constraint solution that suits the “flattened” network realized through the incorporation of direct communication between Aggregation Routers. With our approach, despite of a higher number of Ingress —Egress pairs for traffic in the access network, the number of RPs has been kept to the desirable level whilst the reliability indicator and the path diversity index ratio have increased up to 47% and 33% respectively. Our proposed MPR-based offline approach has also shown improvement compared with the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) offline approach."
2056313,21212,8228,Adaptive Reliable Multi-Path Provisioning in WDM Mesh Networks,2008,"We investigate the problem of adaptive reliable multipath provisioning in next-generation backbone mesh networks employing optical wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and channelization techniques such as SONET/SDH, and supporting virtual concatenation (VCAT). With VCAT, a connection request can be split, diversely routed, and inversely multiplexed on to multiple paths, a feature that has many advantages over conventional single-path provisioning, such as improved reliability, load balancing, etc. However, these diversely routed traffic components are subject to the differential delay constraints (DDC), which could be limited by the destination node's delay-compensation capability, network operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P), or connection quality-of-service (QoS). We introduce a new notation M : N (m) for multipath provisioning where a service path for a connection is set up with M primary paths and N backup paths, where each path may have a fraction of the bandwidth of the connection, and (m) in this notation denotes multipath'. We present the flexibility and benefits of multipath provisioning and develop an analytical model to analyze the connection availability under M : N (m) provisioning schemes. We propose two types of bandwidth migration methods, which can be implemented by link- capacity adjustment scheme (LCAS) protocol of next-generation SONET/SDH, to optimize resource usage. We develop two adaptive heuristic algorithms to provision a connection subject to DDC while satisfying its service-level agreement (SLA). We show that, for end-to-end connection-availability-guaranteed service, multi- path provisioning can achieve better network performance than traditional single-path provisioning. With bandwidth migration, we can further improve the performance."
2752754,21212,8228,The Interaction of Production and Consumption in the News Media Social Space,2009,"Newspapers are operating in increasingly competitive and fragmented markets for audiences and advertising revenues, government media policy and changing audience requirements for news and the ways in which it is presented and delivered. A growing army of bloggers and amateur citizen journalists now delivers - but rarely edits - content for all media platforms, while new media technologies, combined with the changing structure of global news industries, are radically changing the ways in which newspapers and media business functions and struggles for profitability. Our research sought to answer the question of how the internet is impacting on producer/consumer value activities in the news media supply chain. To answer this question initial descriptive statistical analysis was performed on 51 newspapers. This was followed by a focus group undertaken with London-based news media organizations and bloggers. The findings showed that in spite of initial fear and rejection, the internet is now firmly embedded in news media supply chain operations. Firms are now using the internet as an operant resource and working proactively with consumers to develop various forms of relationship value. We highlight the role of consumers in the creation of news (editorial) content and consumer-driven moves toward a merged media platform of distribution (including television, online, mobile and printed forms). Regional news media organizations will probably continue to survive if they are able to supply a highly specialized and ‘hyper local’ community service. This will be in the form of ‘hybrid’ content: analysis, interpretation and investigative reporting in a print product that appears less than daily combined with constant updating and reader interaction on the web."

However, its main drawback is a long decoding delay increasing proportionally with the number of signals in the channel. Very often those high latencies may not be tolerable in practical high-speed wireless communication systems. The remedy for that is parallel interference cancellation (PIC), where the detector aims at estimating the signals of all streams at once, running an algorithm in an iterative manner. Usually the number of iterations is much smaller than the number of signals in the channel and therefore much lower delays are possible with PIC comparing to SIC."
1655648,21212,8228,Joint Viterbi decoding and decision feedback equalization for monobit digital receivers,2013,"In ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems with impulse radio (IR) modulation, the bandwidth is usually 1GHz or more. To process the received signal digitally, high sampling rate analog-digital-converters (ADC) are required. Due to the high complexity and large power consumption, employing multibit high-rate ADC is impractical. However, monobit ADC is appropriate. The optimal monobit digital receiver has already been proposed. This kind of receiver has been derived under the assumption that the intersymbol interference (ISI) either does not exist or can be regarded as random noises. When encountered with heavy ISI, these receivers are not excellent as we expected. There are many approaches to solve the ISI problem in regular communication systems. When applied to monobit systems, unfortunately, most of them turned out to be unavailable due to the great loss of quantification. Decision feedback equalization (DFE) is an effect way to deal with ISI in monobit digital systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that combines Viterbi decoding and DFE together for monobit receivers. In this way, we suppress the impact of ISI effectively, thus improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. In addition, we introduce a method called state expansion by which better BER performance can be achieved. Under the condition of perfect channel state information(PCSI), the simulation results show that the algorithm has about 1dB SNR gain compared to separate monobit BPSK demodulation with convolutional decoding and 1dB SNR loss compared to the BER performance of optimal monobit receiver in the channel without ISI. Compared to the full resolution detection in fading channel without ISI, it has 3dB SNR loss after state expansion. Under the CSI that achieved from iterative evaluation, both the performance of optimal monobit receiver and joint receiver have 1dB loss compared to that of PCSI."
501481,21212,8228,Linear network coding and parallel transmission increase fault tolerance and optical reach,2015,"As optical networks evolve towards more dynamicity and an ever more efficient and elastic spectrum utilization, a more integrated, fault tolerant and system efficient design is becoming critical. To increase efficiency of spectral resource in bit rate per Hz (bit/s/Hz), high-level modulation formats are used, challenged by the accompanying optical impairments and the resulting limitation of optical reach. Previous work has addressed the issue of optical reach and transmission fault tolerance in the physical layer by deploying various FEC schemes and by a careful design of optical transceivers and links. This paper uses a different approach, applicable to link and networking layers. We propose a novel theoretical framework, whereby a randomized linear network coding (LNC) is applied to the main optical path, and in parallel, an auxiliary optical path is used at much lower transmission speeds, i.e., in addition to the main path. With the reception of the auxiliary path, as we analytically show, the system is highly tolerant to bit errors and packet loss caused by optical impairments in the main path, whereby alleviating the constraints on optical transmission quality and indirectly achieving better optical reach and spectral efficiency. The results are shown for a case study of high-speed Ethernet end-system transmitted over optical OFDM networks, which due to the inherent system-level parallelism in both networks, present one of the most interesting candidate technologies for the proposed method to yield best performance."
2853150,21212,8228,Utility function-based TOPSIS for network interface selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,2016,"In Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWNs), the mobile terminals are equipped with multiple access network interfaces (GSM, UMTS, LTE, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.), to provide the possibility for mobile end-users to rank the networks and dynamically select the best one at anytime and anywhere, which is well known as Always Best Connected (ABC). In such environment, the major issue is network interface selection, which is a decision making problem with multiple alternatives (networks) and attributes (network characteristics, application requirements, terminal capacities, and user needs). In this context, many approaches have been proposed. Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) algorithms present a promising solution for multi-criteria decision making problems. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is one of MADM algorithms, which is widely adopted. TOPSIS ranks the available networks based on their scores, with the highest being the best. TOPSIS suffers from couple limitations. First is the ranking abnormality, e.g. if a low ranking network is disconnected then the order of higher ranking networks changes, which results in the selection of a less desirable network. Second is the selection strategy, where TOPSIS simply selects the network with highest score regardless of whether or not it satisfies the user and/or application needs. In this paper, we propose a new strategy based on utility function to remedy these shortcomings. The effectiveness of our strategy is evaluated through simulations. Obtained results show clearly that our strategy eliminates the rank reversal (ranking abnormality) phenomenon, and enhances the ranking quality by considering application and/or user needs."
1758438,21212,8228,Quality-of-service-aware fiber wireless sensor network gateway design for the smart grid,2013,"Smart grid aims to enhance the efficiency, security and the reliability of electricity generation, delivery and consumption. Smart grid benefits from a variety of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for the betterment of the power grid. Two-way communications between the customers and the utility, advanced monitoring tools and intelligent control mechanisms are the key components to realize the new services of the smart grid. Particularly, energy monitoring tools at the customer premises as well as event and ambient monitoring tools at the substations, power lines and vaults play a significant role in managing and protecting the smart grid. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology is a promising monitoring tool for residential premises and the smart grid assets. However, the large volume of data collected by billions of sensors requires a robust communication infrastructure to deliver data from the field to the operators in a timely manner. In this paper, we adopt the Fiber-WSN architecture to support both WSN data and Fiber To The Home/Building/Curb (FTTX) traffic. We design a Fi-WSN gateway that allows data prioritization, maintains the Quality of Service (QoS) of FTTX users and delivers WSN data in a reliable manner. Data prioritization is fundamental for design considerations since ambient data have lower priority than an alarm generated at a smart grid asset. Our gateway employs a burst assembly mechanism that allows differentiation between high and low priority packets in the Fiber-WSN architecture. We show that the proposed gateway design attains low delay for high priority packets while maintaining the delay of FTTX traffic and the reliability of the WSN at desired levels."
1499569,21212,8228,"Architecture and applications of a versatile small-cell, multi-service cloud radio access network using radio-over-fiber technologies",2013,"Small-cell systems based on cloud radio access network (cloud-RAN) architecture have been proposed as promising solutions to meet the ever-increasing capacity demand of the next-generation wireless access networks. By centralizing the processing power to reduce the complexity of conventional cell sites, the cloud-RAN architecture is ideal for large-scale small-cell system at reduced capital and operational expenses. However, high-speed, flexible, and scalable backhaul links between the centralized baseband processing unit (BBU) and the remote antenna units (RAUs) are required to support the high throughput of the small-cell cloud-RANs, and the conventional approaches are based on digital baseband signal transmission in the backhaul links. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-service small-cell wireless access architecture based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) technologies. By utilizing analog radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in the optical backhaul links, the design of RAUs can be further simplified. In addition, by combing RoF with optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) techniques, multiple bands, multiple services and multiple operators can coexist in a shared optical infrastructure without interference. To demonstrate the proposed system, two-operator coexistence in a shared small-cell cloud-RoF access network is implemented in an in-building testbed by using off-the-shelf optoelectronic components and commercialized WiMAX base stations and clients. In addition, the feasibility of delivering both conventional wireless services and future-proof high-RF-band services (millimeter-wave band) is also demonstrated in the proposed multi-service small-cell cloud-RoF access systems."
1472493,21212,8228,Opportunistic cooperation for infrastructure-to-relaying-vehicles over LTE-A networks,2013,"We extend vehicular cooperation into downlink LTE-A networks in what we call Infrastructure-to-Relaying-Vehicles (I2RV) cooperation. In I2RV, vehicles are used as relaying terminals between eNodeB/BS and a receiving user equipment located or mounted on another traveling vehicle, for the aim of extending coverage, improving performance, and attaining distributed transmission. Initial works on cooperative vehicular communications build upon the assumption of flat and quasi-static fading channels, this can be justified only for narrowband systems in very slow traffic flows such as in rush-hours. In this paper, we consider highway traffic with high-speed mobility resulting in doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To overcome the performance degradation, we make use of precoded cooperative transmission accompanied with an opportunistic best-relay selection technique to extract the rich underlying multipath-Doppler-spatial diversity gains. Our performance analysis through pairwise error probability (PEP) derivation shows that, through proper precoding, the proposed system is able to extract maximum available diversity in time, frequency and space. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expressions for the outage probability as a bench-mark for future analysis for the proposed scheme. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that significant coverage advantage by extending the transmission distance targeting a specific error rate and using the same transmitting power can be achieved."
2392768,21212,8228,Intelligent Weather Aware Scheme for Satellite Systems,2008,"Rain, snow, gaseous, cloud, fog, scintillation and other atmospheric properties can have a distorting effect on signal fidelity of Ku and Ka bands, thus resulting in excessive digital transmission error. This loss of signal is commonly referred to as signal attenuation. Signal attenuation impacts the QoS in wireless and satellite networks. Accurately predicting channel attenuation due to atmospheric conditions can enable mitigation planning by adaptively selecting appropriate modulation, coding, transmitted power level, transmission rate and configured frame size. The aim of this paper is to estimate different attenuations using predicted signal-weather correlated database in collaboration with ITU-R propagation models combined with interpolation methods, gateway, and ground terminal characteristics. A three dimensional relationship is proposed among these attenuations with respect to propagation angle and rainfall rate [l]-[8]. The outcome is key factor in diagnosing, adjusting and improving satellite signal power, modulation and coding schemes, monitored and controlled altogether by a powerful and efficient intelligent-based attenuation countermeasure system. These results will lead to an enhanced back propagation-learning algorithm that is used to iteratively tune the IS with returned SNR values to activate the weighted Modulation/Codepoint to its optimal values, depending on actual or predicted weather conditions, configuration settings and tolerance/safety margins for SLA commitment."
2417351,21212,8228,Maximum Likelihood Receiver for MMSE Relaying,2011,"One major goal for future wireless communication systems is a uniform user experience. In order to solve this problem, additional relay nodes can be used to support the communication. Up to now mainly two relaying functions are considered, namely Amplify-Forward (AF) and Decode-Forward (DF). DF can either mean a channel decoding at the relay or a hard decision directly on the received signal which will be called DetF here to avoid confusion. But both have certain drawbacks: AF suffers from noise amplification whereas with DetF useful information is lost due to the hard decision. For this purpose a relay function minimizing the mean squared error called Estimate-Forward (EF) has been proposed in the literature combining the benefits of AF and DetF. If more than one relay is considered or if the signal received directly from the source contains useful information, these signals should be combined properly. In the case of nonlinear functions at the relay like for DetF or EF, the disturbance of the signal received from the relay is not Gaussian any more and simple weighted linear combining like Maximum Ratio Combining for Gaussian channels is suboptimal. In this paper we will derive a Maximum Likelihood detector for EF with higher order modulation schemes. This receiver results in significant gains in terms of bit error rate and mutual information and therefore leads to a higher user throughput compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, these gains are obtained without increasing the computational complexity of the terminals significantly."
1898697,21212,8228,Cost-Optimized Planning for Supporting 100 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s Services over Channel Count-Limited Optical Transport Networks,2011,"The increasing traffic demand resulting from the widespread use of information and communication technologies is impelling network operators to upgrade the capacity of their existing transport network facilities. Recent advances in the scientific community have led to the first developments in serial 100 Gb/s technology that could provide an adequate solution for solving the capacity expansion problem. Nevertheless, given the complexity of 100 Gb/s transceiver equipment, the initial costs may refrain early adoption of the technology, leading carriers to invest in more cost-effective alternatives. Embedded in the optical transport network (OTN) functionality portfolio, traffic grooming and virtual concatenation can be exploited in order to optimally combine 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s equipment for supporting mixed line rate (MLR) demands. Hence, this work proposes an optimization framework for designing optical transport infrastructures with the objective of minimizing the network costs directly related to transceiver and regenerator equipment. The framework models the problem via an integer linear programming formulation that takes into account the relative cost, the maximum optical reach, and the capacity of each optical interface, as well as the optical channel limit per fiber link. As a result, the proposed method is able to select the equipment type and the routing path for each connection which correspond to the most cost-effective solution satisfying the 100G and 40G service demands."
2315793,21212,8228,Interaction of RSVP and Mobile IPv6 Protocols: An Evaluation of Performance on Wireless Networks,2006,"RSVP is considered the Integrated Services (IntServ) standard in providing QoS guarantees while Mobile IP is the standardized IETF proposal to facilitate terminal mobility in wireless IP networks. Since the former provides QoS guarantees and the later offers IP mobility, one would think that simply superimposing the two technologies would yield an optimum solution. This however is evidently not the case since RSVP was initially designed with static nodes in mind. This paper attempts to highlight the key issues involved with such an interaction by providing a testbed to quantitatively analyse how RSVP and MIPv6 hosts would likely to interact under different congestion scenarios. This paper also evaluates the potential effects and/or advantages of applying Mobile IPv6 enhancements such as Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 and Fast Handovers. As speculated, simply deploying default RSVP over MIPv6 does not yield an optimum result. More importantly, we show that in high congestion scenarios the IP-in-IP encapsulation introduced by HMIPv6 creates additional end-to-end packet delay and a slightly higher packet loss than MIPv6; thereby degrading the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Based on our findings, MIPv6 with Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) operates best with RSVP due to minimal loss of packets during handoffs in addition to a smaller IP header when compared to HMIPv6. Finally we summarise the basic requirements needed to achieve an optimum QoS solution"
2703623,21212,8228,SmartSec: Secret sharing-based location-aware privacy enhancement in smart devices,2015,"In the recent past we have witnessed a quick rise of smart devices, including smart phones, tablets, smart watch, smart television as well as other smart devices. The smart devices store quite a lot of sensitive personal data (e.g., private photos). These devices can breach one's privacy if information in the devices are accessed by unauthorized users. Therefore, smart devices are facing threats of privacy leaking and how to protect privacy of smart devices is regarded as an important research challenge. In this paper, we propose a system, coined as SmartSec, which employs secret sharing techniques among multiple smart devices to enhance privacy protection. In particular, SmartSec can achieve privacy enhancement by storing sensitive data (e.g., photos) on at least three devices and requiring at least two of them to access the original data. This will thus secure the data from any unauthorized attackers because any leakage of one piece of secret is meaningless. Further, secret sharing will introduce extra computation and transmission overhead. To reduce such an overhead and optimize the performance, another important feature of SmartSec is that it could recognize and classify different locations by exploiting location tags and then apply different security policy to different locations to achieve the tradeoff of security and performance. For example, a user can demarcate safe regions (e.g., home area) and the sensitive data will be automatically recovered in home region, distributed and stored/masked at different devices in public regions, where the process is automated which provides the user a transparent experience. We implement the system and conducted a series of experiments on the prototype to evaluate the results."
2024871,21212,8228,Design and Implementation of Physical Layer Private Key Setting for Wireless Networks,2009,"Due to the enormous spreading of applied wireless networks, security is actually one of the most important issues for telecommunications. One of the main issue in the field of securing wireless information exchanging is the initial common knowledge between source and destination. A shared secret is normally mandatory in order to decide the encryption (algorithm or code or key) of the information stream. It is usual to exchange this common a priori knowledge by using a secure channel. Now a days a secure wireless channel is not possible. In fact normally the common a priori knowledge is already established (but this is not secure) or by using a non-radio channel (that implies a waste of time and resource). This contribution deals with the proposal of a new modulation technique ensuring secure communication in a full wireless environment. The information is modulated, at physical layer, by the thermal noise experienced by the link between two terminals. A loop scheme is designed for unique recovering of mutual information. The probability of error/detection is analytically derived for the legal users and for the third unwanted listener. The proposed scheme has also been implemented in a Xilinx Virtex II FPGA.#R##N##R##N#All the results show that the performance of the proposed scheme yields the advantage of intrinsic security, i.e., the mutual information cannot be physically demodulated (passive attack) or denied (active attack) by a third terminal, leading us to conclude that the proposed technique is really useful for private key distribution in every wireless network."
2929705,21212,8228,Multiple time-scale energy scheduling with energy harvesting aided heterogeneous cloud radio access networks,2016,"In the next generation wireless communication networks, a large portion of operational expenditures (OPEX) has to be paid for energy consumption. Millions of base stations consume more energy in order to support increasing dramatically data traffic and diverse application services. Energy harvesting is becoming a promising technology to minimize the traditional power demand and thus reduce the OPEX. However, energy management and scheduling in conventional heterogeneous cellular network is greatly challenged. In this paper, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for the design and analysis of heterogeneous radio access network (H-C-RAN) with energy harvesting, which is composed of heterogeneous internet service provider (ISP) and remote radio heads (RRH) powered by energy harvesting facilities. The proposed hierarchical framework is feasible and tractable to utilize a market economical model which can work efficiently by utilizing energy sharing and energy trading among different ISPs. Moreover, we design user association scheme for D2D-assisted based on energy storage capacity and traffic load status of each small cell. Inspired by the fact that the energy harvesting rate, selection of user association and channel state vary in different time scale, we also propose a multiple time-scale energy scheduling strategy by modeling this issue using multitime scale Markov decision processes (MMDP). Simulation experiments indicate that the proposed strategies are able to significantly reduce the energy cost."
1992678,21212,8228,Delay bound analysis in real-time networks with priority scheduling using network calculus,2013,"Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in large-scale real-time computing and communication networks are supported by enabling technologies such as real time scheduling, which can be implemented by priority scheduling. In order to guarantee the hard delay bound for delay sensitive applications, worst-case analysis has been developed. Network Calculus (NC) is a well known network analysis tool as it possesses a set of properties particularly suitable for large-scale networks. In NC, the arrival process and the service process of a system are bounded by the arrival curve and the service curve, respectively. These two curves are then used to derive the bounds of performance measures. However, due to the difficulty in properly choosing the curves, original NC based on min-plus algebra is not always able to provide tight performance bounds. In this paper, we develop a NC approach based on max-plus algebra and use it to derive the upper delay bound of a network system with non-preemptive priority scheduling. In max-plus NC, the arrival curve is defined as the lower bound on the cumulative inter-arrival time and the service curve gives the upper bound on the cumulative service time. Since we derive the worst-case cumulative service time for non-preemptive priority scheduling, these definitions allow us to choose the curves in such a way that they accurately capture the main characteristics of the arrivals and services. As a result, our max-plus NC approach generates tight delay bounds. In an example Controller Area Network (CAN) system, a series of numerical results for our delay bounds turn out to be as tight as the simulated worst-case delay. Therefore we prove that NC, as a suitable analytical method for large-scale real-time networks, is capable of providing accurate performance bounds."
295520,21212,8228,Cognitive prediction of end-to-end bandwidth utilisation in a non-QoS video conference,2015,"The most sought after bandwidth killer application on networks has been video conference. For a complex network, specifically based within an organization, implementing quality of service (QoS) is administratively not always feasible as the priorities are regulated. Predicting future network traffic in a non-QoS implemented network by using information about the source, destination and application can give preparatory time to make the network ready for unstable and random demands. The paper uses machine learning techniques to predict the bandwidth utilization of an end-to-end video conference session. Experimental results in this paper show that these features work well in detecting the bandwidth utilization. These experiments were done on a corpus of 24,000 video conference connections. The cognition is based on experimenting on features such as time of call, source, destination, call type, expected duration and cause codes. The result is based on combination of all these features which gave an accuracy of more than 78% on real traffic using two of the common classifiers - k-nearest neighbors and tree based classifier. Support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes gave lower learning accuracy. Prediction results were also obtained by varying the combination of features to detect the predominating features in the cognition. It has been established that the bandwidth at which the connection is established is not entirely dependent on the source and destination but the other features also play a role in deciding the bandwidth of the connection. The prediction accuracy further increases if video calls are allowed only at discrete pre-designated bandwidth levels."
2826454,21212,8228,Energy-aware concurrent multipath transfer for real-time video streaming to multihomed terminals,2016,"The rapid advancements in networking technologies and hand-held devices enable mobile users to concurrently receive real-time multimedia streaming (e.g., high-definition video) with different radio interfaces (e.g., Wi-Fi and LTE networks). Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) is an important transport-layer solution to implement concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) over heterogeneous wireless networks with multihomed terminals. However, it is challenging to distribute multimedia content to the resource-limited mobile devices because of the contradiction between energy consumption and streaming quality. To deliver the energy-efficient and quality-aware multimedia streaming over multiple wireless networks, this paper presents an Energy and goodPut Optimized CMT (EPOC) solution. First, we develop an analytical framework to model the relationship between energy consumption and goodput performance for real-time multimedia transmission to multihomed mobile devices. Second, we propose a joint Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding and rate allocation scheme to minimize energy consumption while satisfying goodput constraint. EPOC effectively leverages the energy-goodput tradeoff and multipath diversity to optimize mobile multimedia transmission in heterogeneous networking environment. We conduct the performance evaluation through extensive semi-physical emulations in Exata involving H.264 video streaming. Compared with the reference CMT schemes using SCTP, EPOC achieves appreciable improvements in energy conservation, goodput and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)."
1942342,21212,369,On Selfish Distributed Access Selection Algorithms in IEEE 802.11 Networks,2006,"An important question for future wireless networks is whether the prioritization between different accesses should be controlled by the networks or terminals. Herein we evaluate the performance of distributed access-selection algorithms where terminals are responsible for both AP selection and the necessary measurements. In particular, we focus on determining whether selfish distributed algorithms can perform as well as centralized ones (for comparison we include max-sum, max-min, proportional fair and minimum delay allocations). The study is conducted by time-dynamic simulations in a IEEE 802.11a network and as performance measures we use file transfer delay and supportable load at a maximum tolerable delay. Our results show that selfish algorithms can offer similar performance, both in terms of throughput and fairness, as the centralized schemes as long as they account for both path- loss and access point load. This is an important result and it suggests that terminal-controlled algorithms are just as efficient as centralized schemes, which besides extensive measurements also require that AP exchange information, for improving the efficiency in WLAN networks. Compared with a minimum path- loss selection criteria, which is standard in the IEEE 802.11 family today, our distributed load-aware algorithm increases the maximum supportable load with more than 200 percent even after accounting for measurement time and estimation errors. With fast reselection during ongoing sessions the gains can be further increased with, typically, 20 percent."
460328,21212,8228,Dynamic adaptive streaming over popularity-driven caching in Information-Centric Networks,2015,"The growing demand for video streaming is straining the current Internet, and mandating a novel approach to future Internet paradigms. The advent of Information-Centric Networks (ICN) promises a novel architecture for addressing this exponential growth in data-intensive services, of which video streaming is projected to dominate (in traffic size). In this paper, we present a novel strategy in ICNs for adaptive caching of variable video contents tailored to different sizes and bit rates. Our objective is to achieve optimal video caching to reduce access time for the maximal requested bit rate for every user. At its core, our approach capitalizes on a rigorous delay analysis and potentiates maximal serviceability for each user. We incorporate predictors for requested video objects based on a popularity index (Zipf distribution). In our proposed model, named DASCache, we present delay queuing analysis for cached objects, providing a cap on expected delay in accessing video content. In DASCache, we present a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) formulation for the cache assignment problem, which operates in rounds based on changes in content requests and popularity scores. DASCache reacts to changes in network dynamics that impact bit rate choices by heterogeneous users and enables users to stream videos, maximizing Quality of Experience (QoE). To evaluate the performance of DASCache, in contrast to current benchmarks in video caching, we present an elaborate performance evaluation carried out on ndnSIM, over NS-3."

2059841,21212,8228,Cooperative Sensing among Cognitive Radios,2006,"Cognitive Radios have been advanced as a technology for the opportunistic use of under-utilized spectrum since they are able to sense the spectrum and use frequency bands if no Primary user is detected. However, the required sensitivity is very demanding since any individual radio might face a deep fade. We propose light-weight cooperation in sensing based on hard decisions to mitigate the sensitivity requirements on individual radios. We show that the link budget that system designers have to reserve for fading is a significant function of the required probability of detection. Even a few cooperating users (~10-20) facing independent fades are enough to achieve practical threshold levels by drastically reducing individual detection requirements. Hard decisions perform almost as well as soft decisions in achieving these gains. Cooperative gains in a environment where shadowing is correlated, is limited by the cooperation footprint (area in which users cooperate). In essence, a few independent users are more robust than many correlated users. Unfortunately, cooperative gain is very sensitive to adversarial/failing Cognitive Radios. Radios that fail in a known way (always report the presence/absence of a Primary user) can be compensated for by censoring them. On the other hand, radios that fail in unmodeled ways or may be malicious, introduce a bound on achievable sensitivity reductions. As a rule of thumb, if we believe that 1/N users can fail in an unknown way, then the cooperation gains are limited to what is possible with N trusted users."

2037531,21212,8228,Estimating an End-User's Received Video Signal at the Transmitter Using Cross-Layer Feedback,2011,"The proliferation of wireless technology, mobile computing, and increasingly sophisticated video codecs have fueled the sharp increase in demand for user-centric applications involving wireless video streaming. Consequently, it is becoming progressively more important to ensure that wirelessly transmitted video signals are delivered with optimal perceptual quality to the end-user. This is in contrast to traditional QoS, which aims to optimize system and packet-level performance, but not necessarily perceptual quality. In order to drive towards this goal, one of the most important evolutions to modern video streaming systems will be the adaptive allocation of both wireless and video coding resources at the transmitter - ideally according to a cost function designed to optimize some measure of the received perceptual video quality. Unfortunately, it is not at all likely that a transmitting station will have access to the video signal received by the end-user, and therefore, this precludes the possibility of using such a perceptually-oriented cost function. Indeed, current resource allocation strategies are based on simplistic packet-statistic-based estimates of the received video quality, and one can easily demonstrate that this results in suboptimal perceptual video quality to the end-user. In this paper, we propose a simple, but powerful technique which allows a transmitting station to obtain an accurate estimate of the video signal seen by the recipient using cross-layer feedback between the wireless MAC and the video encoder, thus enabling the transmitter to use more perceptually oriented resource allocation strategies. We support the proposed technique through both simulation and experiments involving a database of over 420 distorted H.264 AVC compressed video sequences."
2138031,21212,8494,Channel estimation for a new high performance MIMO STC-OFDM WLAN system,2005,"A novel MIMO STC-OFDM technique has been developed that achieves both high spectral efficiency and high performance over frequency selective channels. This is accomplished by a combination of MIMO OFDM, group coded transmit signals and antennas, array processing at the receiver for interference suppression on a per carrier basis, and a new decoding scheme. It also incorporates frequency diversity by pairing, for STC purposes, subcarriers that are K/2 apart, where K is the total number of FFT frequencies. This paper discusses a channel estimation scheme for this new 4/spl times/4 MIMO WLAN system. Time domain matrix-vector formulation leads to estimates that have an SNR on the order of 48 dB when just one block of high power QPSK symbols per transmitter is used, while the receiver AWGN SNR is 19 dB or higher. The final 4/spl times/2 equivalent channel matrix, for each of the two component subsystems, is shown to have a corresponding SNR of 37 dB. Most importantly, the loss in system BER performance due to the channel estimation process (compared to the known channel case) is found to be negligible. At 19 dB signal SNR, this new scheme achieves a BER of 3/spl times/10/sup 4/, without the need for coding or interleaving. The data rate achieved, over a bandwidth of 20 MHz, is 144 Mbps with a corresponding spectral efficiency of 7.2 bits/s/Hz."
400334,21212,8228,Optimum variable step-size adaptation in a speech driven in-service non-intrusive measurement device,2001,"This paper proposes an efficient time-varying step-size adaptation algorithm implemented within an in-service non-intrusive measurement device (INMD) in public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). The adaptation step-size is obtained from the correlation of the input speech signal. The effect of the correlation method is described and the variable step-size is derived. The in-service non-intrusive measurement system of interest is used to monitor the delivered quality of service (QoS) by monitoring the echoes in the telephony network INMDs are usually based on a class of least mean square (LMS) digital adaptive filters (DAFs). The performance criterion is defined by the modelling convergence rate derived from the optimal Wiener weights, and the excitation for the DAFs is conversational speech. Experimental observations have shown that divergence occurs during the low energy unvoiced segments in high-noise environments. The optimum adaptation step-size minimises such divergence by using low step-sizes during unvoiced periods. This result is then compared with a perfect divergence detector (PDD), which employs the unknown Wiener weights, a technique applicable in simulations only. The optimal step-size method reported produces a significant improvement in the system's performance in a noise-impaired environment where the near-end speech and echo path speech are contaminated with noise. Original simulation results show a modelling misadjustment improvement of 30.3 dB and 11.9 dB for noise free and noisy (signal to noise ratio, S/N of 5 dB) near-end speech respectively, all at a far-end echo to noise ratio (E/N) of 0 dB over 1 second adaptation."
2865876,21212,8228,Traffic big data analysis supporting vehicular network access recommendation,2016,"With the explosive growth of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), it is undoubted that vehicular demands for real-time Internet access would get a surge in the near future. Therefore, it is foreseeable that the cars within the IoV will generate enormous data. On the one hand, the huge volume of data mean we could get much information (e.g., vehicle's condition and real-time traffic distribution) through the big data analysis. On the other hand, the huge volume of data will overload the cellular network since the cellular infrastructure still represents the dominant access methods for ubiquitous connections. The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) offloading is a promising solution to alleviate the conflict between the limited capacity of cellular network and big data collection. In a vehicular heterogeneous network formed by cellular network and VANET, an efficient network selection is crucial to ensure vehicles' quality of service. To address this issue, we develop an intelligent network recommendation system supported by traffic big data analysis. Firstly, the traffic model for network recommendation is built through big data analysis. Secondly, vehicles are recommended to access an appropriate network by employing the analytic framework which takes traffic status, user preferences, service applications and network conditions into account. Furthermore an Android application is developed, which enables individual vehicle to access network automatically based on the access recommender. Finally, extensive simulation results show that our proposal can effectively select the optimum network for vehicles, and network resource is fully utilized at the same time."
2460320,21212,8228,Parallel-trellis turbo equalizers for sparse-coded transmission over sparse multipath channels,2003,"A novel coding and turbo equalization scheme for sparse multipath channels is presented in this paper. A burst-error-correcting convolutional code, which coding and interleaving via a sparse encoder and a convolutional interleaver, is selected as the channel code. A previously-proposed parallel-trellis framework is adopted for implementing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalizer and decoder in the turbo equalizer. Such a system exhibits a similar level of performance to a conventional system using a random-error-correcting convolutional code together with a row /column (R/C) or random block interleaver. Yet, the proposed system has the advantages of low latency and low memory requirements when compared to those conventional systems. This is due to (i) the elimination of the block-type interleavers and deinterleavers and (ii) the parallelism achieved in the turbo equalizer. One disadvantage of the proposed system is to decrease in throughput, as more tail symbols are required for proper termination of all sub-trellises in the decoder. Extension of the proposed system to turbo codes is considered. Also, the effect of prefiltering on a nonminimum-phase, high definition television (HDTV) channel is examined. Results indicate that using the feedforward filter (FFF) of a nonuniformly-spaced decision feedback equalizer (NU-DFE) performs almost as good as using one with a large number of uniformly-spaced taps. However, far fewer computations are needed to find the optimum tap values of the sparse prefilter."
1385756,21212,8228,A Case for WiFi Relay: Improving VoIP Quality for WiFi Users,2010,"Voice over Internet (VoIP) has been experiencing enormous growth in recent years. While posed to replace traditional PSTN for both enterprise and residential customers, VoIP has yet to achieve the same level of quality and reliability as PSTN. One key challenge is that a growing segment of customers is increasingly relying on WiFi connections. VoIP over WiFi (VoWiFi) experiences significant degradation in quality because of packet losses, mostly due to WiFi's low capacity, varying signal strength, interference, etc. To understand this problem, we have developed and deployed a comprehensive measurement platform in a global enterprise network. From large-scale real-world traces, we quantitatively analyze the impact of WiFi connections and study measures to mitigate such impact. Our results confirm that WiFi connections incur significantly more packet losses than wirelines, but these losses can be effectively concealed by sending each packet up to five times (heavy replication). Due to WiFi's inherent overhead, heavy replication only marginally increases WiFi airtime. To avoid the overhead on wirelines, we further propose a relay-based solution, where heavy replication only occurs between endpoints and nearby relays, and is removed before packets are transmitted on inter-branch long haul links or the public Internet. The solution has been implemented and deployed in the global enterprise network, and measurement results confirm that it can indeed greatly improve the performance of VoIP for WiFi users. In particular, it reduces the percentage of poor calls from 35% to 10%; and increases the percentage of acceptable ones from 45% to 70%."
2732985,21212,8228,User-centric base station clustering and sparse beamforming for cache-enabled cloud RAN,2015,"Cloud radio access network (Cloud RAN) is able to significantly improve the network capacity and energy efficiency through centralized processing of multiple distributed base stations (BSs). Yet it also places tremendous burden on backhaul links that connect these BSs. In this paper, we introduce a cache-enabled Cloud RAN, in which each BS is equipped with a local cache with limited storage capacity. If the content requested by a user is not cached at the serving BSs of the user, it will be distributed to the serving BSs via the backhaul links from the central processor (CP). We investigate the dynamic user-centric BS clustering and sparse beamforming by taking both channel condition and cache status into account. We formulate an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of backhaul cost and transmit power cost subject to an individual signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each user. This problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We apply the iterative reweighted l1-norm technique to find an approximate solution. Theoretical analysis also shows that all the BSs which cache the content requested by a user can always be included in the BS cluster of this user, regardless of their channel conditions. Based on this finding, we propose a cache-aware greedy selection BS clustering algorithm. Simulation results show that caching can greatly improve the tradeoff between backhaul capacity and transmit power. It is also demonstrated that popularity-aware caching is superior to random caching in Cloud RAN."
1847682,21212,8228,A secure message delivery scheme with path tracking for delay tolerant networks,2012,"In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), message delivery is operated in an opportunistic way through store-carry and forward relaying, and every DTN node is in anticipation of cooperation for data forwarding from others. Unfortunately, there always exist some selfish nodes that are reluctant to contribute to this cooperative data forwarding procedure so as to save their valuable storage buffer, limited computation power and precious energy. In order to stimulate nodes' willingness to participate in data forwarding, a number of incentive schemes have been proposed recently. However, most existing incentive schemes simply ignore efforts of nodes involved in message delivery if messages delivered fail to reach their destinations. Due to the nature of DTN, such as intermittent connectivity, it is not unusual to have unreliable message delivery, which results in unrewarded or wasted efforts for participating nodes and may discourage them from participating in future data forwarding. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize contribution of every node involved in a data forwarding procedure even the message it helps to forward doesn't successfully reach its destination. However, how to track all delivery paths so as to give every intermediate node some incentive for their cooperative efforts of data forwarding is still an open research problem. To address this problem, we propose a secure message forwarding scheme with path tracking. The proposed method is end-to-end secure with data source and identity authentication. In addition, it can thwart some well known attacks including edge inserting attack, sibling inserting attack and free riding attack."
2890107,21212,8228,dHSS - distributed Peer-to-Peer implementation of the LTE HSS based on the bitcoin/namecoin architecture,2016,"The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) within the packet core of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a key node leveraged for essential operations, such as mutual authentication and access control. This centralized node is essential for the overall network operation as it is the cornerstone of the cryptographic functions executed in a mobile network. It stores several parameters for each subscriber, including a copy of the secret key ki that is securely stored in the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has sparked the concern in the industry on the potential risk of control plane signaling overloads. Due to the traffic characteristics of IoT devices and the potential risk of malfunctioning or compromised devices, there is a potential risk for floods of signaling traffic overwhelming the mobile core network and, in particular, the HSS. Moreover, recent security research has theorized potential attacks against this central core network node that could be launched from a botnet of compromised smartphones. In this paper we theoretically introduce a novel distributed and secure Peer-to-Peer (P2P) implementation of the HSS. Based on the Bitcoin/Namecoin framework, this new architecture drifts away from the symmetric key model of the standard HSS and proposes a robust public key infrastructure. Moreover, it does not rely in central points of failure, it is resilient to signaling overload threats and allows to re-authenticate and re-generate mobile session keys frequently with zero control plane signaling load at the mobile core."
1905743,21212,8228,Differentiating Data Security and Network Security,2008,"Data security, since antiquity, relies on cryptography. Cryptography is as good as the inability of a person or a computing machine to break the generated cipher code. It has been demonstrated that this inability is temporary because some strong cryptographic methods that were believed to be unbreakable have been broken. Thus, as cryptography is seeking new and more difficult cryptographic venues, cryptoanalysts become increasingly sophisticated in breaking codes. However, both ciphertext and secret keys are transported over the communications network from where, with proper means, they can be harvested for analysis, and furthermore to impersonate a source, or cause service denial. Thus, in addition to hard ciphers for data encryption and sophisticated distribution methods, the network itself needs to be attack-hard and attack-smart. That is, the network should have appropriate mechanisms that monitor and detect attacks, intelligence that discriminates between degradations/failures and attacks, and also protocols for robust countermeasure strategies to outsmart the attacker. Thus, although data security deals with ciphering client-originating payload, network security deals with the secure transport of data. Because the latter is a relatively new topic, it requires more insight and particularly a thorough understanding of fault/degradation mechanisms and attack scenarios and how they distinguished. In this paper we outline data security and differentiate from network security. Additionally, we describe a method for detecting the channel signature and how it is used to discriminate between degradation/failure and attacks and thus enhance network security. Moreover, we describe a method for attack detection and countermeasure strategies."
2465391,21212,10192,Scalable network monitoring for multimedia applications in enterprise networks,2004,"Networked multimedia applications require stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees from the underlying data network. Many techniques have been proposed at the network layer to deliver acceptable QoS for such applications. In this paper, we explore providing network monitoring support in the application layer for QoS policies. We study the feasibility of a scalable network monitoring service that real-time applications may access to gather network status information in order to adapt to changing network conditions and take actions such as making application level routing decisions. We propose a scalable, low probing overhead monitoring service based on monitoring utilization on network devices traversed by multimedia traffic. Our motivation is to take advantage of often intersecting end-to-end paths traversed by multimedia traffic in an enterprise setting. We empirically assess the QoS improvements resulting from a service that monitors network utilization for an application involving dynamic server selection on a real production network. Specifically, we compare the performance of various dynamic server selection strategies for multimedia streaming including random selection, round-trip time based selection, proximity based selection, and utilization based selection. Our results indicate that compared to random selection, server selection strategies that rely on our network utilization based monitoring scheme result in significantly lower end-to-end delay and packet loss in streaming sessions. Compared to round-trip time based selection, our scheme results in comparable end-to-end delay and loss figures while incurring significantly lower probing cost"
622586,21212,8228,Optimal per-node rate allocation to provide per-flow end-to-end delay guarantees in a network of routers supporting guaranteed service class,2002,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of providing worst-case end-to-end delay guarantees to a token bucket constrained flow traversing a series of N packet schedulers. We consider a network of routers that support the guaranteed service class of the IETF Integrated Services (IntServ) Working Group; this service class is proposed to provide quality of service (QoS) in the Internet. Under this framework, a worst-case end-to-end delay bound to a flow is provided by allocating a rate at each network element on the path of the flow. We associate a cost with allocating a rate at each link. The cost is assumed to be a convex and non-decreasing function of rate. We investigate the problem of obtaining an optimal rate allocation for a flow that minimizes the total cost subject to the delay requirement and the available link capacity constraints. Allocating an identical rate at each link on the path of a flow is a widely used approach under the guaranteed service framework. We investigate the optimality of this approach and show that under certain conditions, it need not be optimal. Moreover, we investigate the optimal solution to the total cost minimization problem and give scenarios in which we can explicitly obtain the optimal solution. Based on these results, we present an algorithm for optimal rate allocation that is based on multiple rates. However, with blocking probability as the performance criterion, we find through simulations, that the optimal rate allocation algorithm is only marginally better for connections with longer path lengths at the expense of those with shorter path lengths. We also observe that the performances of both the algorithms are very close and so, in practice, the simpler identical rate algorithm may be sufficient."
2091708,21212,8228,Transmit Power Adaptation for a Mobile Multibeam Spot Diffusing Optical Wireless System in One and Two Planes,2008,"The received signal quality in indoor optical wireless (OW) systems is partly influenced by the change in receiver location relative to the optical transmitter. Employment of an angle diversity receiver counters signal degradation caused by background noise sources. While spot diffusing transmitters have been shown to produce better performance over the conventional full diffuse transmitters, transmit power distribution among the multiple beams, in studies to date, takes no account of the change in the transmitter-receiver separation especially when both are fully mobile. We investigate the performance of two new spot diffusing geometries based on clustering of spots on ceiling and walls. The performance is evaluated for both stationary and mobile transmitters in conjunction with diversity detection and is compared with that of the single line strip optical wireless system. Furthermore, single spot power adaptation is carried out on both systems and the discussion of the results highlights the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain in comparison to the single line strip. The results show that while the adaptive transmit power approach achieved as much as 2dB increase in SNR for the single line, the one- plane configuration achieved a 5.7dB SNR gain near corners without power adaptation and 15.8dB with adaptation over the single line strip. The two-plane approach improved the SNR around the room centre (at the locations of the noise sources) by 5.2dB without adaptation and 11.6dB with the adaptive approach compared to the single line for both cases. Moreover, both configurations maintain the same improvement pattern when the transmitter is mobile."
2886173,21212,8228,The synergic enhancement of coexistence performance in wireless mobile combo-chips,2016,"This paper deals with the problem of severe wireless performance degradation when multiple wireless technologies are concurrently utilized in a same user device. This type of usage is already frequent in most smartphones and laptops, such as streaming Bluetooth audio while using a Wi-Fi download, and is more intensifying with IoT device deployment which triggers the coexistence of heterogeneous wireless technologies. To lower the form factor and the cost, chip vendors package multiple wireless interfaces into a single combo-chip where a common antenna is shared by multiple network technologies in a time division multiplexing manner. We issue that the careless operations of combo-chip design incur indeed performance degradation for in-device wireless coexistence and show the experimental results via TCP performance measurements in several smartphones and laptops. Our analysis reveals that the behavior negatively affects not only on the transmit power management of wireless access point, but also on the congestion control of TCP sender. We propose a cooperative switching scheme which incorporates TCP control behaviors for better coexistence and implement it on Android and Linux devices. Under the simultaneous use of in-device network interfaces, our approach led a WLAN throughput increment up to eight times without the mentioned issues. Further, this does not require any modification of TCP sender and wireless access point. Thus, the approach is directly applicable to existing mobile devices and also easily extendable to the combination of other in-device wireless technologies."
2393428,21212,8228,Single-Ended FDR to Locate and Specifically Identify DSL Loop Impairments,2007,"Widespread deployment of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Internet service is impeded by faults in the telephone lines and, for high-speed video services, even a minor discontinuity is important. Identification of faults can help service providers pre- qualify lines for DSL service and fault monitoring is essential to maintain an established service. Some faults affect many customers and should be repaired immediately while others, affecting only one customer, degrade slowly and repairs can be scheduled later. Thus, repair can be more effectively scheduled if the type of fault is known. With sufficiently sensitive test equipment, the entire length of the telephone line could be tested from the switching center which avoids costly dispatch of technicians and facilitates automated monitoring. Our method uses frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) and measurements show extended range with enhanced sensitivity and resolution when compared to the well- known time domain reflectometer (TDR). The FDR method easily detects a change of wire gauge at 1200 meters while a commercial TDR instrument is barely able to do so. To remotely identify the fault type, we introduce a new measurement of reflection phase angle: water in the cable (~160deg), bad splice (~10deg), gauge changes (~135deg), bridged taps (180deg), and open circuits (0deg)."
324085,21212,8228,Data age based retransmission scheme for reliable control data exchange in platooning applications,2015,"Recent advances in cooperative driving hold the potential to significantly improve safety, comfort and efficiency on our roads. Platooning of heavy vehicles, where automated or semi-automated driving allows minimal inter-vehicle gaps, has shown considerable reductions in fuel consumption. Although using the same wireless communication technology, a platoon differs from a VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork) in several points. It is centralized in its nature, with a well-defined group leader, its topology is fairly stable and it has very challenging requirements on timeliness and reliability of its control data exchange. Therefore, the IEEE 802.11p protocol suite and its recently defined message types do neither support the needs of a platooning application nor take advantage of its properties. A platoons control loop must continuously be fed with fresh data, so the information age is an important parameter to be closely monitored. In this paper, we therefore propose a framework for centralized channel access and retransmission capabilities for safety critical inter-platoon control data based on the data age of earlier received messages. A simulation evaluation compares our solution to a) the decentralized, standard-compliant IEEE 802.11p MAC (Medium Access Control) method, and a time-slotted scheme b) with and c) without retransmissions and shows that the centralized, data age based retransmission scheme clearly outperforms its competitors in terms of maintained data age."
2874843,21212,8228,"Field testing, modeling and comparison of multi frequency band propagation characteristics for cellular networks",2016,"Frequency band propagation characteristics measurement and modeling is a prerequisite for cellular network plan and infrastructure deployment. However, the generally assumed Okumura-Hata, and COST 231 large-scale channel model are based on transmission data collected in some specifical areas, which has application limitations for the other different cities. With the rapid development of 4G and study on 5G cellular systems, there are multiple radio access networks covering the same areas, and thus the transmission characteristics are more complicated and still unknown to all. Different from prior work focusing on channel characteristics for only one specifical frequency band in one specifical scenario, in this work, we investigate and compare Radio Frequency (RF) transmission characteristics for eleven different frequency bands varying from 700 MHz to 3500 MHz under various terrains and landscapes, including high-density area, urban city area and rural area. Moreover, three different fitting and modeling methods on testing data are compared, and under high-density scenario, the effects of different antenna height on the transmission characteristics is studied. It is found that the standard deviation of path loss indicates in the range of 9dB which is available for network requirement. With the increase of frequency, the standard deviation decreases. Moreover, the transmit antenna height is defined as above 30m to obtain best coverage. Our work will facilitate networks planners and researchers on future 5G networks."
1118810,21212,8228,Implementation of physical-layer network coding,2012,"This paper presents the first implementation of a two-way relay network based on the principle of physical-layer network coding. To date, only a simplified version of physical-layer network coding (PNC), called analog network coding (ANC), has been successfully implemented. The advantage of ANC is that it is simple to implement; the disadvantage, on the other hand, is that the relay amplifies the noise along with the signal before forwarding the signal. PNC systems in which the relay performs XOR or other denoising PNC mappings of the received signal have the potential for significantly better performance. However, their implementation also poses many challenges. For example, the relay must be able to deal with symbol and carrier-phase asynchronies of the simultaneous signals received from the two end nodes, and the relay must perform channel estimation before decoding. We investigate a PNC implementation in the frequency domain, referred to as FPNC, to tackle these challenges. FPNC is based on OFDM. In FPNC, XOR mapping is performed on the OFDM samples in each subcarrier rather than on the samples in the time domain. We implement FPNC on the universal soft radio peripheral (USRP) platform. Our implementation requires only moderate modifications of the packet preamble design of 802.11a/g OFDM PHY. With the help of the cyclic prefix (CP) in OFDM, symbol asynchrony and the multi-path fading effects can be dealt with simultaneously in a similar fashion. Our experimental results show that symbol-synchronous and symbol-asynchronous FPNC have essentially the same BER performance, for both channel-coded and unchannel-coded FPNC."
2618526,21212,8228,Two-Way Training Design for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems,2011,"This work examines the use of two-way training to efficiently discriminate the channel estimation performances at a legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR) in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. This work improves upon the original discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme proposed by Chang where multiple stages of feedback and retraining were used. While most studies on physical layer secrecy are under the information-theoretic framework and focus directly on the data transmission phase, studies on DCE focus on the training phase and aim to provide a practical signal processing technique to discriminate between the channel estimation performances (and, thus, the effective received signal qualities) at LR and UR. A key feature of DCE designs is the insertion of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal to degrade the channel estimation performance at UR. To do so, AN must be placed in a carefully chosen subspace, based on the transmitter's knowledge of LR's channel, in order to minimize its effect on LR. In this paper, we adopt the idea of two-way training that allows both the transmitter and LR to send training signals to facilitate channel estimation at both ends. Both reciprocal and nonreciprocal channels are considered and a two-way DCE scheme is proposed for each scenario. For mathematical tractability, we assume that all terminals employ the linear minimum mean square error criterion for channel estimation. Based on the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimates at all terminals, we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the optimal power allocation between the training signal and AN is found by minimizing the MSE of LR's channel estimate subject to a constraint on the MSE achievable at UR. Numerical results show that the proposed DCE schemes can effectively discriminate between the channel estimation and, hence, the data detection performances at LR and UR."
2356247,21212,8228,Simple asynchronous multiple access (SAMA) for ad hoc wireless networks in unlicensed bands,2001,"Effective spectrum sharing between non-interoperable radio devices as well as collocated but non-communicating radio networks is an important goal for the designers of RF spectrum. Apart from the traditional approach of selecting separate channels for distinct systems, there are methods such as spread spectrum, scheduling of transmissions in non-overlapping intervals to reduce collisions and also spatial diversity to reduce the effects of interference. The last two are the most promising methods to use to achieve multi-megabit data rates and high traffic densities. The listen-before-transmit (LBT) etiquette has been used with limited success in the past in decentralized RF environments to enable non-interoperable systems to share spectrum. We introduce the simple asynchronous multiple access (SAMA) scheme that combines some of the known channel access techniques in a novel way to achieve an implicit reservation effect that allows high throughput with modest overhead and low complexity without demanding interoperability or even explicit communications between the collocated systems. We analyze the throughput and spatial performance of SAMA. The analysis is based on the radio propagation law and the geometry of the users and antennas in the plane. It is aimed at establishing the fundamental performance bounds dictated by our basic assumptions. We cover the omni-directional antenna case and give preliminary results for the directional antenna."
310830,21212,8228,Optimizing Cloud Mobile 3D Display Gaming user experience by asymmetric object of interest rendering,2015,"The growing popularity of auto-stereoscopic 3D displays for mobile devices, together with ubiquitous wireless networks, have fueled an increasing user expectation for rich 3D mobile multimedia experiences, including 3D display gaming. However, rendering 3D games on mobile devices requires high computational power and battery and thus may restrict users from enjoying true 3D experience for a long time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of developing Cloud Mobile 3D Display Gaming, where the 3D video rendering and encoding are performed on cloud servers, with the resulting 3D video streamed wirelessly to mobile devices with 3D displays. However, with the significantly higher bitrate requirement for 3D video, ensuring user experience may be a challenge considering the bandwidth constraints and fluctuations of mobile networks. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetric Object of Interest (OOI) rendering approach, which adapts the rendering richness of different objects according to their importance in order to reduce the video encoding bitrate needed while maintaining a satisfactory video quality, thereby making it easier to transmit the 3D game video over wireless network. Specifically, we first develop a model to quantitatively measure the user experience by different OOI rendering settings. We also develop a model to relate the bitrate of the resulting video with the changes of different OOI Rendering settings. We further propose an optimization algorithm which uses the above two models to automatically decide the optimal OOI rendering settings for left view and right view to ensure the best user experience given the network conditions. Experiments conducted using real 4G-LTE network profiles on commercial cloud service demonstrate the improvement in user experience when the proposed optimization algorithm is applied."
2040058,21212,8228,Run-time allocation of buffer resources for maximizing video clip quality in a wireless last-hop system,2004,"The transmission of digital video over wireless channels faces many problems common Io both wired and wireless networks such as bandwidth and buffer restrictions and low energy constraints, together with problems unique to wireless technologies such as extreme and rapidly varying channel noise. In this paper, we focus on enabling (he wireless communication of video clips despite the noisy and dynamic nature of wireless channels. Many efforts have been made in the past to increase the error resiliency of compressed video, but these approaches have not considered the effects of buffering on the received video quality. Traditional buffering (where a sliding window of the next few frames is kept in the buffer at all times), while useful for overcoming latency jitter, cannot be used Io guarantee against poor video quality and stalls due to wireless channel fluctuations. To help overcome the weaknesses of traditional buffering, we introduced out-of-order buffering (ORBit), a method for selecting important frames from throughout a video clip and buffering them before playback begins. ORBit can lead to significant gains in video quality despite variations in the wireless channel during the communication of a video clip, but requires the judicious selection of ORBit frames, with their corresponding quantization and channel coding levels. To enable run-time selection of ORBit frames, we introduce a fast video distortion estimation technique. Using our estimation technique, we present an ORBiI decision algorithm that selects ORBit frames depending on the wireless technology and end-user appliance constraints. Using the ORBit has to wait for a few seconds before the video display begins. During decision algorithm, significant gains of up to 9 dB in video quality are obtained."
922329,21212,8228,Using spatial correlation of ocean current for velocity estimate of underwater drifting nodes,2013,"The ability to navigate underwater is a key requirement for most underwater applications. Mobile devices, drifters, and also human divers, all require precise navigation capability to perform long term missions while being submerged. In the absence of GPS reception, performing underwater navigation (UN) requires an accurate state-space-model (SSM) to allow the tracked node (TN) to self-estimate its location. However, irregularities in nodes motion (mostly due to unpredictable changes of ocean current) makes it hard to reliably determine the SSM. In this paper, we rely on spatial correlation of ocean current, and propose to estimate the drift velocity of the TN as a combination of the drift velocities of anchors, and to directly use it as part of the SSM. This not only augments the amount of information available for the TN to track its own position, but also offers an unbiased velocity estimate which increases the reliability of the SSM. Since ocean current may not be always correlated (for example, in the case of turbulence), we offer two unbiased confidence indexes: one which is based on the range to the anchor, and a second which is based on the homogeneity of the current velocity field. To evaluate the potential of utilizing node spatial dependencies for UN, we collect trajectories of drifting nodes from both model-based simulations and a sea trial performed in Israel. Our results suggest that nodes drifting motion shows strong spatial correlation which could greatly enhance the performance of tracking algorithms."

VSR and backplane networks provide 100-Gb/s data transmission between blade servers and LAN switches. This architecture supports 100-Gb/s-throughput, high-reliability, and low-latency data transmission, making it well suited to VSR and backplane applications for inter-LAN-switch and intra-cabinet networks. Its links comprise ten 10-Gb/s highspeed serial lanes. Payload data are transmitted by a ribbon fiber and a copper cable for VSR applications and by copper channels for the backplane board. Ten lanes convey Ethernet data frames and parity data of forward-error correction code (newly developed (544, 512) code FEQ, providing highly reliable (BER<lE-22) data transmission with a burst-error correction with low latency (i.e., 29.0 ns on the transmitter (Tx) side and 104.4 ns on the receiver (Rx) side). A 64B/66B code-sequence-based skew compensation mechanism, which provides low-latency compensation for the lane-to-lane skew, is used for multi-lane serial transmission. Testing an ASIC with this physical-layer architecture showed that it can provide 100-Gb/s data transmission with a 747-kgate circuit, which is small enough to be implemented in a single LSI. Furthermore in this paper, insufficient FEC rate in past report was solved, and a technique for improving reliability of the above compensation mechanism was proposed."

The integration and interoperability of this multitude of available networks will lead to the emergence of the fourth generation (4G) of wireless technologies. 4G wireless technologies have the potential to provide these features and many more, which at the end will change the way we use mobile devices and provide a wide variety of new applications. However, such technology does not come without its challenges. One of these challenges is the user's ability to control and manage handoffs across heterogeneous wireless networks. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed method is capable of distinguishing the best existing wireless network that matches predefined user preferences set on a mobile device when performing a vertical handoff. The overall performance of the proposed method shows 87.0 % success rate in finding the best available wireless network. To test for the robustness and effectiveness of the neural network algorithm, some of the features were removed from the training set and results showed a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. Hence, managing vertical handoffs through user preferences can be significantly affected with the selection of features used to provide the closest match of the available wireless networks."
2845460,21212,8228,A two-stage rank selection scheme in downlink CoMP transmission networks,2016,"This paper considers a downlink Coordinated Multi Point (CoMP) transmission network, where the base stations (BSs) are connected to a central unit via backhaul links to serve mobile users (MUs). The objective is to jointly optimize the BS mode (active or sleep), MU association, and cooperative beamforming to minimize the total power consumption including backhauling power. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer non-convex problem under the constraints of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements and limited BS power. By exploiting a hidden convexity structure of the SINR, the problem is first transformed equivalently into a mixed-integer second-order core programming (MI-SOCP) problem. Due to the coupled integer variables, the complexity of exhaustive search grows exponentially with network size, which motivates developing low-complexity heuristic algorithms. We propose a novel Two-stage Rank Selection (TRS) method to approximately solve the coupled MI-SOCP problem by determining the BS operation mode and MU association successively, which enables the remaining beamforming computation to be achieved through an efficient SOCP solution. We compare the computational complexity and numerical performance of TRS against several state-of-the-art alternatives. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational complexity and the total power consumption over existing alternatives."
678439,21212,8228,Optimal dedicated protection approach to shared risk link group failures using network coding,2012,"Survivable routing serves as a key role in connection-oriented communication networks for achieving desired service availability for each connection. This is particularly critical for the success of all-optical mesh networks where each lightpath carries a huge amount of data. Currently, 1+1 dedicated path protection appears to be the most widely deployed network resilience mechanism because it offers instantaneous recovery from network failures. However, 1+1 protection consumes almost twice as much capacity as required, which imposes a stringent constraint on network resource utilization. In addition, finding an SRLG-disjoint path is essential for 1+1 protection, which is nonetheless subject to non-trivial computation complexity and may fail in some SRLG scenarios. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework of 1+1 protection, called Generalized Dedicated Protection (GDP), for achieving instantaneous recovery from any SRLG failure event. It is demonstrated, that finding a non-bifurcated optimal solution for GDP is NP-complete. Thus, the paper presents a novel scheme applying Generalized Dedicated Protection and Network Coding (GDP-NC) to ensure both optimal resource utilization among dedicated protection approaches and instantaneous recovery for single unicast flows, which can be split into multiple parts in all-optical networks. We demonstrate that the proposed GDP-NC survivable routing problem is polynomial-time solvable, owing to the ability to bifurcate flows. This flexibility comes at the expense of additional hardware for linear combination operations for the optical flows."
2245022,21212,8228,Opportunistic Virtual Backbone Construction in Intermittently Connected Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,2011,"Data communication over intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks (ICMANs) can be carried out by opportunistically employment of mobility nature of nodes and the storage space of all nodes. In order to overcome mobility randomness and subsequently uncertainty of future network state, multi-copy-based routing approaches are widely considered. However, scalability is still an issue, even extra routing information such as mobility statistics and context is employed to control the number of message copies. This is because communicating overhead to exchange all such information still exponentially increases as network size increases. Therefore, this paper introduces an opportunistic virtual backbone (VBB) constructing algorithm to form a hierarchical architecture over ICMANs. Once VBB is formed, all routing information and multiple message copies are limited among the VBB members, and thereby routing overhead can be reduced dramatically. Different from the conventional unit disk graph (UDG) based solutions for MANETs, the proposed algorithm utilizes a weighted graph derived from mobility statistics to model underlying long-term stable topology of ICMANs. To reduce constructing overhead, only partial two-hop mobility statistics are collected by each node. Moreover, intermittent connectivity and delayed message transmission are also addressed in the paper. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly scalable as network size increases and the existing SCF routing protocols can work well over ICMANs where VBBs are formed."
862851,21212,8228,An energy efficiency power and sub-carrier allocation for the downlink multi-user CoMP in multi-cell systems,2012,"Coordinated multi-point transmission/reception (CoMP) has been proposed as an effective technology to improve cell-edge throughput in next-generation wireless systems. However, all the BSs(Base Station) need to share all the users' messages to do the global precoding for supporting each user best service, such as which BS will be chosen for cooperating or how to realize the cooperation, lots of energy will be consumed when doing this process. In addition, in most of the existing works, BSs always allocate equal power to all the users neglecting user's Channel State Informations(CSIs) or their service requirements, this may also cause enery wasting. In this paper, we focus on the throughput maximizing problem while fully considering energy saving problem in the CoMP systems. At first, we propose the concept of “cell zooming” which we define that one of the cooperating BSs will “sleep” if it improves little to user's service, then a sub-carrier allocation algorithm with varying power assignment in downlink CoMP system is put forward, this can lower the transmit power of BS. We formulate that the sub-carrier and power allocation problem is a mixed binary integer programming (MBIP) problem, a “green” subcarrier and power allocation algorithm which can maximize the cell's throughput is proposed at last, the power allocated to each user will be calculated. Simulation results show that the proposed sub-carrier and power allocation algorithm is much better on users' throughput and fairness while consumes less energy than the existing ones."
2284762,21212,8228,Let me grab your App: Preliminary proof-of-concept design of opportunistic content augmentation,2012,"With the rate of mobile traffic growth eventually outpacing 4G technology upgrades, it appears crucial to explore new means to offload cellular networks. Exploitation of device-to-device opportunistic short range connectivity for offloading purposes is an intriguing and widely investigated direction, but might ultimately play a negligible practical role: in front of the huge overall content universe a user may select to access, it is indeed unlikely that a specific user request is found in a possibly small number of neighboring mobile devices. Focusing on a concrete use-case scenario, namely Apps download from Google's Android market, we discuss a preliminary design and implementation of CarpeDroid, a local coordination approach devised to proactively augment the network response to a user lookup (in our use-case, coming from the App Market server) with download opportunities for content locally stored in neighboring devices and likely to fall within the users' interest. Our approach aims at acting as a simple recommending system, locally operated on the end user device, and not requiring any interaction with centralized servers. Efficiency and “better than nothing” privacy protection is achieved through the exchange of Bloom filters devised to summarize content opportunistically available in neighboring devices."
1530646,21212,8228,Enhancing QoS/QoE in multimedia networks,2013,"In a multimedia context, QoS (Quality of Service) is a measure of success. It represents the guarantee of successfully delivering packets, without delaying or dropping any, therefore, the guarantee of providing high quality experience for end-users. Depending on the content being delivered, there exist various parameters which need to be considered when designing QoS architectures, such as latency, jitter, bandwidth and packet loss. There is a direct and high impact of such parameters on voice quality, video streaming, data traffic etc. On the other hand, high-performance networks are required to support different traffic types, alternating from continuous data streams for real-time communication to burst traffic for best-effort communication. The traffic on high-performance networks can be divided into four categories: Constant Bit Rate, Variable Bit Rate, Available Bit Rate and Unspecified Bit Rate, according to the service requirements of source applications and to the arrival characteristics. The aim of the research work presented in this paper is to identify the most appropriate QoS-related techniques to be applied in order to provide qualitative services and to ensure the efficiency of resource consumption, under the constraints imposed by each traffic type. The research results are based on performance measurements conducted within our Competence Center for Network Management, taking into consideration various traffic types, queuing mechanisms and resource reservation protocols."
1969735,21212,8228,LS Channel Estimation for Mobile OFDM Communications on Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Fading Channels,2007,"A least-squares (LS) channel estimation (CE) technique for mobile OFDM communications over a rapidly time-varying frequency-selective fading channel is investigated in this paper. The proposed technique keeping the comb-type pilot arrangement can achieve low error probability by accurately estimating channel impulse response (CIR) and effectively tracking rapid CIR variations. In addition, the LS CE technique proposed here is conducted in the time domain (TD); meanwhile, a generic estimator is, thus, performed serially block by block without assistance from a priori channel information and without increasing computational complexity. By taking advantage of linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) or pseudorandom signals that are transceived for the purpose of sounding pilot subchannels, the proposed LS channel estimator (CE) can inherently perform pseudo-noise (PN) matched filtering (MF) to suppress multipath interference (MPI) caused by frequency-selective fading and inter-carrier-interference (ICI) resulting from data subchannels. The dual optimality of the LFM and PN pilot symbols is verified for both time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD) CEs. Furthermore, the proposed technique also exhibits good resistance against residual timing errors occurring with the DFT demodulation. Extensive computer simulations in conjunction with statistical derivations show the superiority of the proposed technique."
2307166,21212,8228,Optimization of packet scheduling in wireless systems with smart antennas: geometric models and algorithms,2004,"Beam forming techniques of adaptive antenna arrays (smart antennas) allow to reduce the mutual interference of simultaneous transmission in wireless access systems exploiting angular separation of user terminals. At the radio resource management layer the information on the arrival direction of signals can be taken into account by the scheduling algorithm so that transmissions of too close user terminals can be scheduled in different time-slots, while transmissions of users with an enough angular separation can be simultaneous. In other words, time diversity is exploited by the scheduling algorithm when spatial diversity is not sufficient to obtain good quality transmissions. In this paper we propose a novel approach to the problem of packet scheduling with smart antennas using mathematical programming. Based on a simplified system model we formulate two combinatorial optimization problems. In the first problem we have to select a subset of users, which can be simultaneously served in a given time slot so as to maximize the number or the total priority of the users served. An arc-circular model is proposed together with an exact polynomial-time algorithm, which searches for a path of maximum total weight in an appropriate graph. In the second problem users must be partitioned into non-interfering subsets so as to minimize the number of time slots needed to transmit all the given packets. For both problems heuristics have been devised in order to obtain approximate solutions in the short time available for packet scheduling in real systems."

For this purpose, we focus here on an OCDMA system using 2 Dimensional (2D) multi- weight spreading codes. At the reception, a Hard Limiter (HL) device in front of the Conventional Correlation Receiver (CCR) is used to reduce the multiple access interference. To evaluate the performance of this scheme in a noisy optical channel, we develop an approximated calculation which provides a theoretical upper bound of the multi-weight code performances. In addition, for any noise amount, the optimal CCR threshold can be exactly determined. We use the theoretical results to design the multi- weight codes adapted to the transmission of three services with respectively low, medium and high Bit Error Rates (BER). Thanks to our theoretical approach, the noise impact is analyzed and shown being very significant for each service. It is possible to take the noise power into account in the code design, but at the cost of the increase of the spreading code length. To overcome these drawbacks, we investigate the BER gain provided by Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes. The results obtained show that Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a good way to improve the multimedia access network potentialities.

1848273,21212,8228,HySAC: A Hybrid Delivery System with Adaptive Content Management for IPTV Networks,2011,"The emergence of new platforms providing Internet protocol television (IPTV) services, such as Google TV [1] and Apple TV [2] is expected to revolutionize the way multimedia services are provided on the Internet. However, the existing network infrastructure falls well short of meeting the resource requirements to provide satisfactory levels of such services. This has led the service providers like Google to contemplate deploying large farms of network cables to transport the traffic generated by their IPTV services. However, the huge cost involved in achieving their target, means careful resource planning and meeting users' expectations are essential. In this paper, we propose an effective adaptive HYbrid delivery System Adaptive Content management (HySAC), which dynamically selects the mode of video delivery from unicast, multicast and peer-to-peer (P2P) based on the popularity of the respective videos. The videos are dynamically classified into high, medium and low popularity groups and, they are delivered using multicast, P2P and unicast methods respectively. HySAC reduces the start-up delay as the mode of delivery is well defined and the resource availability to support the delivery is guaranteed. We have evaluated the performance of HySAC on a realistic simulated environment and presented experimental results; they indicate that HySAC performs significantly better than pure unicast, multicast and P2P mechanisms. This paper also provides a mechanism to classify the videos into different popularity classes."
2263375,21212,8228,Improving the MAC layer performance in ad hoc networks of nodes with heterogeneous transmit power capabilities,2004,"The performance of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol has been shown to degrade considerably in an ad hoc network with nodes that transmit at heterogeneous power levels. The main cause of this degradation is the potential inability of the high power nodes to hear the RTS/CTS exchanges between nodes when at least one node involved in the communication is a low power node. The propagation of the CTS message beyond the one-hop neighborhood of two communicating low power nodes was considered in our prior work in an attempt to alleviate this effect. However, this resulted in an excessive overhead and further degraded the performance at the MAC layer. In this paper we consider two techniques to reduce the overhead incurred due to the aforementioned propagation of the CTS message: (a) the use of an intelligent broadcast scheme and (b) the reservation of bandwidth for the sequential transmission of multiple data packets with a single RTS/CTS exchange (and propagation as needed). These techniques require changes only at the MAC layer. We find, by means of extensive simulations, that these techniques provide a significant improvement over the legacy IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol in the considered power heterogeneous ad hoc network. The overall throughput improves by as much as 12 % and the throughput of the low power nodes improves by up to 14 % as compared to the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Furthermore, the schemes find applicability even in homogeneous networks as they reduce the number of false link failures that arise when the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is used, by about 20 %. We conclude that the proposed schemes together offer a simple yet effective and viable means of performing medium access control in power heterogeneous ad hoc networks."
1118880,21212,8228,Low-carbon routing algorithms for cloud computing services in IP-over-WDM networks,2012,"Energy consumption in telecommunication networks keeps growing rapidly, mainly due to emergence of new Cloud Computing (CC) services that need to be supported by large data centers that consume a huge amount of energy and, in turn, cause the emission of enormous quantity of CO 2 . Given the decreasing availability of fossil fuels and the raising concern about global warming, research is now focusing on novel “low-carbon” telecom solutions. E.g., based on today telecom technologies, data centers can be located near renewable energy plants and data can then be effectively transferred to these locations via reconfigurable optical networks, based on the principle that data can be moved more efficiently than electricity. This paper focuses on how to dynamically route on-demand optical circuits that are established to transfer energy-intensive data processing towards data centers powered with renewable energy. Our main contribution consists in devising two routing algorithms for connections supporting CC services, aimed at minimizing the CO 2  emissions of data centers by following the current availability of renewable energy (Sun and Wind). The trade-off with energy consumption for the transport equipments is also considered. The results show that relevant reductions, up to about 30% in CO 2  emissions can be achieved using our approaches compared to baseline shortest-path-based routing strategies, paying off only a marginal increase in terms of network blocking probability."
1535690,21212,8228,General total inter-carrier interference cancellation for OFDM high speed aerial vehicle communication,2013,"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered as a strong candidate for next generation high speed aerial vehicle communication systems. However, OFDM systems suffers severe performance degradation due to inter-carrier interference (ICI) in high mobility channel, if no ICI cancellation is performed. Traditionally, training symbols have been employed in one packet to help the OFDM receiver to estimate the multi-path channel and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) between the transmitter local oscillator and the receiver local oscillator. However, in aerial vehicle communication, the relative transmitter-receiver speed changes so rapidly that it is unreasonable to assume a constant speed (and CFO) during the entire packet transmission. Hence, to accurately estimate the CFO, training symbols need to be transmitted for every OFDM symbol. Obviously, this significantly reduces OFDM throughput while adding complexity due to repeated CFO estimation. In this paper, we extend our previous work to propose a joint channel/CFO estimation and ICI cancellation algorithm. Specifically, in our previous work, we have proposed a total ICI cancellation algorithm using parallel processing for OFDM system which offers the excellent ICI cancellation and BER performance. However, in this work, perfect channel information was assumed. In this paper, we combine the channel estimation with the ICI cancellation together. The proposed general total ICI cancellation algorithm has the ability to jointly estimate the carrier frequency offset and channel information, and improve the performance significantly. Meanwhile, a serial processing is proposed to reduce the computation complexity. Simulation results in different scenarios confirm the performance of the proposed scheme in multipath fading channels for high speed aerial vehicle communication."

This infrastructure hosts many components, numerous technologies, and various devices and computers. The infrastructures and their supported systems are dynamically evolving and can be characterized as ecosystems. On the other hand, attackers over the global Internet exploit weaknesses in one component to attack other parts of the system, taking advantage of lack of global security view. The trend will only increase in the future as more computers are embedded in the infrastructure and more demanding applications are to be developed, and as bigger parts of the global economy move to cyberspace.#R##N##R##N#Given the state of the art and future developments, it seems mandatory to develop a holistic yet practical approach to protect the computing infrastructure, and to embed it in the ecosystem development process. This infrastructure will be a collection of inter related ecosystems, with providers at the center of each ecosystem. In addition, the ecosystemhas to be dynamically evolving. The position stated here is that approaches and methodologies for security will need to change and evolve as well. The view of security as a process rather than as a component is becoming clearer, given the global trend, and the integration of security with the various other steps of the ecosystem evolution is becoming a must as well."
2050139,21212,8228,Communications and Sensing of Illumination Contributions in a Power LED Lighting System,2008,"In recent years, LED technology emerged as a prime candidate for the future illumination light source, due to high energy efficiency and long life time. In addition, LEDs offer a superior flexibility in terms of colors and shapes, which leads to a potentially infinite variety of available light patterns. In order to create these patterns via easy user interaction, we need to sense the local light contribution of each LED. This measurement could be enabled through tagging of the light of each LED with unique embedded IDs. To this end, we propose a new modulation and multiple access scheme, named as code- time division multiple access - pulse position modulation (CTDMA- PPM): a form of PPM which is keyed according to a spreading sequence, and in which the duty cycle is subject to pulse width modulation (PWM) according to the required lighting setting. Our scheme considers illumination constraints in addition to the communication requirements and, to our best knowledge, it has not been addressed by other optical modulation methods. Based on the proposed modulation method and multiple access schemes, we develop a system structure, which includes illumination sources, a sensor receiver and a control system. Illumination sources illuminate the environment and transmit information, simultaneously. According to our theoretical analysis, this system structure could support a number of luminaries equal to the size of the CDMA codebook times the dimming range."
2301952,21212,8228,Extensions of proportional-fair sharing algorithms for multi-access control of mobile communications: constraints and bursty data processes,2005,"We are concerned with the scheduling of transmitter time, bandwidth and power for multi-access mobile communications for data communications when the channels are randomly time varying. Time is divided into small scheduling intervals, called slots, and information on the current channel rates for the various users is available at the start of the slot, when the user selections are made. The proportional fair sharing method (PFS) balances the conflict between selecting the users with the best immediate rates and helping those with poor average throughputs. We have analyzed the convergence and basic qualitative properties (Kushner, H.J. and Whiting, P.A., Proc. Allerton Conf., 2002; IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol.3, p.1250-9, 2004). The paths of the throughputs converge to the solution of an ODE, akin to a mean flow. The behavior of the ODE describes the behavior of PFS. It has a unique equilibrium point that is asymptotically stable and optimal for PFS in that it is the maximizer of a concave utility function. Most past work assumed an infinite backlog of data. The data arrival process is often bursty with the data queued until transmitted, minimal throughput constraints, or a balance between queue length (or delay) and throughput, might be sought. There might be preemption by priority users. Natural modifications of PFS for these cases are shown to have some of the same properties. Simulations illustrate many of the features and the possible tradeoffs."

We claim that the proactive provisioning of estimations about runtime VoIP quality is a crucial facility still missing in VoIP services. For instance, such a facility could be integrated within a Presence Service to inform users of expected quality of VoIP communications towards their contacts before calling them. The paper proposes a novel and scalable solution for proactive quality monitoring, specifically designed for VoIP traffic and based on proper runtime decisions about network partitioning. On top of this monitoring layer, we have designed and implemented an effective and flexible application-level facility for end-to-end QoS estimation. This facility is exploited by an enriched Presence Service in the examined case study. The paper describes the practical experience and the lessons learned in implementing an industrial prototype of the proposal. The prototype is integrated with standard and widespread mechanisms (e.g., SIP Voice Quality Report Event, SIP Answer Mode and SDP Media Loop-back extensions) to facilitate market diffusion and acceptance. First preliminary experimental results show that the proposed prototype achieves accurate quality evaluations and is largely more scalable than traditional end-to-end approaches."
1311774,21212,8228,Time domain synchronous OFDM based on simultaneous multi-channel reconstruction,2013,"Time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) can achieve a higher spectrum efficiency than standard cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM). Currently, it can support constellations up to 64QAM, but cannot support higher-order constellations like 256QAM due to the residual mutual interferences between the pseudorandom noise (PN) guard interval and the OFDM data block. To solve this problem, we break the traditional approach of iterative interference cancellation and propose the idea of using multiple inter-block-interference (IBI)-free regions of very small size to realize simultaneous multi-channel reconstruction under the framework of structured compressive sensing, whereby the sparsity nature of wireless channels as well as the characteristic that path delays vary much slower than path gains are jointly exploited. In this way, the mutually conditional time-domain channel estimation and frequency-domain data demodulation in TDS-OFDM can be decoupled without the use of IBI removal. We then propose the adaptive simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (A-SOMP) algorithm with low complexity to realize accurate multi-channel reconstruction, whose performance is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can support 256QAM without changing the current signal structure, so the spectrum efficiency can be increased by about 30%."

In the proposed scenario, the satellite and the terrestrial components use the same band (primary users) and a group of secondary users (sensors or mobile users) want to dynamically share the spectrum without harmful interference on primary user (PU). The satellite can also report measures provided by the group of secondary users to a remote center in an area where the mobile coverage it is difficult to extend or for emergency situations. The joint use of multiple antennas at each CR node and cooperative cognitive radio scheme is analyzed to improve the performance of the conventional energy detector (ED) and to increase the reliability in PU detection. A coordination center (CC) takes the final decision based on the detections carried out by all the CRS. Moreover, the CC can manage a strategy to allow equal and fare share of the radio resources to the group of CR nodes. The use of improved energy detector based on the average power of received samples is also analyzed. Simulation results show that the use of cooperation and MIMO technologies improves the detection even at low value of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and a trade off-it is necessary among the number of multiple antennas, the number of samples and the spectrum usage efficiency and the level of interference on the PU."
2469404,21212,8228,Characterizing Achievable Rates for Two-Path Digital Relaying,2008,"This paper studies bandwidth-efficient transmission protocol for a two-hop communication network with one source, one destination, and two assisting relays. The two-path successive relaying protocol is considered where the source/destination transmits/receives continuously in time, and two half-duplex relays both operating in a time-division-duplex (TDD) mode successively in turn forward messages from source to destination. By mimicking a full-duplex relay with two alternating half-duplex relays, this protocol ideally achieves the same bandwidth efficiency. However, a major issue for this protocol to be effectively implemented is to tackle the inter-relay interference (IRI), which occurs when one relay listens to the source, it is interfered with by the other relay that transmits to the destination. This paper characterizes achievable rates for the protocol of interest for a simplified symmetric two-path relay channel when both relays employ the decode-and-forward (DF) operation or digital relaying. First, the achievable rate of digital relaying using the conventional repetition coding is derived, and is compared to that of a full-duplex relay. It is shown that owing to the IRI, this method leads to severe rate loss at high signal-to-noise- ratio (SNR) regime. Then, this paper presents a new scheme that can be easily incorporated into the considered protocol to avoid completely any rate loss caused by the IRI. The proposed scheme utilizes the dirty-paper-coding (DPC) -based interference pre-subtraction at the source transmitter, and is shown to be capacity-optimal."

The simulation scenario comprises four access routers and up to 30 mobile nodes that move randomly and communicate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard. The study collected the performance metrics of all mobile nodes from the system. As data traffic video, VoIP, and TCP sources were considered. The goal of the study was to obtain quantitative results of the improvements provided by HMIPv6 with respect to handoff latency, packet loss, signaling load and bandwidth per station as well as an indication of the number of users that could be accommodated depending on the traffic source. Moreover, we performed a 'stress-test' of the protocol to investigate the behavior of the protocol in extreme cases, e.g. under channel saturation conditions. In addition to the quantitative results provided, the simulations taught us insights on the protocol performance not easily gained without performing simulations. For example, we learned that i) in our scenario a low HMIPv6 signaling load reduction outside of the micro-mobility domain implies a significant increase within it, ii) under high saturation conditions we can expect a better performance of HMIPv6 in latency terms but not in packet losses or bandwidth and iii) the consideration of network coverage user unawareness impact the performance results."
2691151,21212,8228,Parametric design space exploration for optimizing QAM based high-speed communication,2015,"The growing demands on high-speed data transmission over long distances require optimized communication systems with bandwidth efficient modulation techniques like Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). However, the various design parameters of these QAM based systems conflict each other and the complex interdependence makes it difficult and time consuming to appropriately tune the parameters towards an optimal solution for a given set of constraints. Therefore, throughout this paper we analyze various conflicting design parameters of QAM and derive objective optimized trade-offs. More specifically, we study in detail the effects and interdependencies of parameters in the matched filter, the Forward Error Correction (FEC) code pair and the modulation order and span the design and solution space through experimental and numerical results. We discuss the observed effects and show how a selection of parameters can be concluded under various constraints. Furthermore, a pareto optimality search on our design space points out the best combinations of modulation order, filter and FEC design parameters for maximizing the performance under various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions of the channel. For instance, if the channel is constrained by a SNR of 10dB and the tolerable Bit Error Rate (BER) is 10−3, then 16-QAM with a required 2/3 FEC yields 33.3% higher performance than 64-QAM with a required 1/3 FEC. Thus, the outcomes of this paper are a comprehensive elaboration on the cross-effects of conflicting design parameters and a set of optimized solutions under various constraints."
2806498,21212,8228,Software-defined Open Access for flexible and service-oriented 5G deployment,2016,"The evolution of 5G mobile radio and its complex interaction with fixed access network infrastructures poses new challenges and opportunities. In this article, a software-defined converged fixed-mobile 5G architecture is introduced using carrier-grade Ethernet as a transport platform. An active remote node (ARN) is used to connect end-users. Powered at a radio base station, the ARN aggregates the traffic of fixed and mobile radio users. Transport capacity is reduced due to statistical multiplexing, and scalability is achieved by a modular design. The ARN enables software-defined networking (SDN) via the open-networks-as-a-service (Open NaaS) control and management plane. Adopting the Open Access model, this architecture offers both, multi-technology and multi-operator features. Next generation fronthaul, resource sharing, synchronization, low latency can all be established as services to build an advanced 5G infrastructure. Key concepts of the new architecture have been realized using low-cost hardware and offer economic high-speed, fixed and mobile Internet. E.g., for wireless connectivity to macro- and small cells, mm-wave links reaching 5 Gb/s and short-range optical wireless links have been used. As data rates can be scaled up, the proposed architecture is considered future-proof for converged 5G fixed-mobile access networks."
2691032,21212,8228,A low-complexity probabilistic routing algorithm for polar orbits satellite constellation networks,2015,"Satellite communication networks have advantages of global coverage and inherent broadcast capability, and offer a solution for providing broadband access to end-users. The regular mesh topologies, typical for satellite networks, comprise of Inter-Satellite Links(ISLs). But due to dynamic changing of traffic load and inter-plane ISL distance variation, adaptive routing is an absolute requirement for optimizing the network utilization. In this paper, we present a low-complexity probabilistic routing(LCPR) algorithm for polar orbits satellite constellation networks. The traditional algorithms choose the path with minimum hops according to the routing tables stored in the on-board equipment. Different from them, we make all the satellite to choose the next hop with minimum propagation delay according to the longitude and latitude of the current node and destination. Without routing table stored in the satellites, the algorithm reduces the space complexity effectively. The whole algorithm has no iteration process, thus decreasing the time complexity to some degree. Additionally, in the proposed algorithm, each satellite can inform the neighbouring satellites of the queue utilization condition periodically so that packet may be sent to a respectively free node adaptively according to the probability. Results from simulations show that LCPR has better performance than other routing algorithms in term of throughput and packet loss rate, which is especially suited large-scale users condition."
2049157,21212,8228,FELL: A Flexible Virtual Network Embedding Algorithm with Guaranteed Load Balancing,2011,"Network virtualization has emerged as the most promising approach to overcome the current ossification of the Internet. A key problem in it is how to efficiently and effectively make use of the substrate network resources by embedding multiple virtual networks with various constraints. Due to its NP-hardness, many heuristic approaches have been proposed. However, most of them simplify the problem by relaxing some constraints, resulting in their designs in conflict with practical limitations. Furthermore, some other important design issues, like load balancing and the response time requirements of different applications, have been usually ignored as well. In this paper, we propose FELL, a Flexible virtual network Embedding algorithm with guaranteed Load baLancing for the general problem. Based on simulated annealing, FELL can flexibly control the tradeoff between results accuracy and running time to meet various requirements of different applications by changing parameters. Load balancing enables substrate network to avoid resource fragmentation and further increases the profit of infrastructure providers. A novel cost criterion that reflects the impact of distribution of allocated resources for an embedding is designed to conduct embedding process to guarantee it. The splittable flow is supported to obtain better resource utilization by making use of small pieces of available bandwidth. We also design some key functions including generating initial and neighbor solutions. The effectiveness of our algorithm is finally validated by our simulations."
1368826,21212,8228,EDR 2 : A sink failure resilient approach for WSNs,2012,"Data collection, redistribution and retrieval are essential components of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In dense WSN deployments, the sensor data are usually sent to a sink that can be reached through one or multiple hops. In the case where communications with the sink are disrupted due to various reasons, the data must be stored in the network for later retrieval. When considering in-network storage, we must redistribute the data among an energy-constrained network with sensors that have a low storage capacity. In previous works, the data redistribution problem has been studied, but the focus was only on the redistribution costs while the data retrieval costs (which have been analyzed in other works as an independent problem) were ignored. We recognize that these two problems should be studied in concert and therefore, in this paper, we combine both data redistribution and retrieval into a single problem. We propose a graph transformation, formulate the problem as a minimum cost flow optimization problem and use linear programming to find the optimal solution. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm named EDR 2 : energy-efficient data redistribution and retrieval. EDR 2  is a distributed energy-efficient algorithm for in-network storage and later retrieval in WSNs. To evaluate our solution on a large scale, we modeled different scenarios in a 400-node network, used the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) to obtain the optimal solutions, and ran simulations to find the solutions using our algorithm. Finally, we implemented EDR 2  using real sensors to demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithm. We compared EDR 2  with two heuristic algorithm and show that our approach is an energy-efficient solution for node selection when redistributing data in a WSN for eventual retrieval."
1808770,21212,8228,Optical WDM Network Planning Using Heterogeneous Multi-granularity OXCs,2007,"Multigranular optical WDM network aims to reduce network cost by grouping multiple wavelengths and then switching those wavelengths together at waveband or fiber levels. To configure such multi-granular network, we have two choices-homogeneous network and heterogeneous network. The former applies only a single type of optical cross connect (OXC) while the latter allows different types of OXCs. Due to the demands varies and change asymmetrically geographically, networks with heterogeneous OXC nodes is especially suitable for placing best switching types at different location. In this paper, we aim at the design of an algorithm to solve the network planning problem in optical network with heterogeneous multi- granularity OXCs. The planning program determines not only the switching granularity for each node but also determine the routing and wavelength assignments to satisfy the given demands. The contributions of the paper are four folded. First, we propose a graph model to represent the OXC node. The transformed graph simplifies the representation of node structure and helps to model the problem. Secondly, we propose a mathematical formulation to model the network planning problem as an ILP problem. Thirdly, a Lagrangean relaxation based heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain a near optimal solution. Fourthly, we studied the impact of waveband size on network cost. This work reveals that the waveband size plays a crucial factor. The proposed algorithms can determine the optimal number of waveband size."
1379121,21212,8228,28 GHz propagation measurements for outdoor cellular communications using steerable beam antennas in New York city,2013,"The millimeter wave frequency spectrum offers unprecedented bandwidths for future broadband cellular networks. This paper presents the world's first empirical measurements for 28 GHz outdoor cellular propagation in New York City. Measurements were made in Manhattan for three different base station locations and 75 receiver locations over distances up to 500 meters. A 400 megachip-per-second channel sounder and directional horn antennas were used to measure propagation characteristics for future mm-wave cellular systems in urban environments. This paper presents measured path loss as a function of the transmitter - receiver separation distance, the angular distribution of received power using directional 24.5 dBi antennas, and power delay profiles observed in New York City. The measured data show that a large number of resolvable multipath components exist in both non line of sight and line of sight environments, with observed multipath excess delay spreads (20 dB) as great as 1388.4 ns and 753.5 ns, respectively. The widely diverse spatial channels observed at any particular location suggest that millimeter wave mobile communication systems with electrically steerable antennas could exploit resolvable multipath components to create viable links for cell sizes on the order of 200 m."
2295475,21212,8228,10-Gbps IP Network Measurement System Based on Application-Generated Packets Using Hardware Assistance and Off-the-Shelf PC,2011,"Targeting high-bandwidth applications such as video streaming services, we discuss advanced measurement systems for high-speed 10-Gbps networks. To verify service stability in such high-speed networks, we need to detect network quality under real environmental conditions. For example, test traffic injected into networks under-test for measurements should have the same complex characteristics as the video streaming traffic. For such measurements, we have built Internet protocol (IP) stream measurement systems by using our 10-Gbps network interface card with hardware-assisted active/passive monitor extensions based on low-cost off-the-shelf personal computers (PCs). After showing hardware requirements and our implementation of each hardware-assisted extensions, we report how we build pre-service and in-service network measurement systems to verify the feasibility of our hardware architecture. A traffic-playback system captures packets and stores traffic characteristics data without sampling any packets and then sends them precisely emulating the complex characteristics of the original traffic by using our hardware assistance. The generated traffic is useful as test traffic in pre-service measurement. A distributed in-service network monitoring system collects traffic characteristics at multiple sites by utilizing synchronized precise timestamps embedded in video streaming traffic. The results are presented on the operator's display. We report on their effectiveness by measuring 1.5-Gbps uncompressed high-definition television traffic flowing in the high-speed testbed IP network in Japan."
2350454,21212,8228,A New STC Structure to Achieve Generalized Optimal Diversity with a Reduced Design Complexity,2007,"We propose a new space-time code (STC) structure that can achieve generalized optimal diversity (GOD) with a reduced design complexity, and also provide an increased coding gain. As a class of GOD STC structure, the new structure achieves the full diversity and an optimized coding gain with minimum delay irrespective of the number of transmit antennas (N t ) and the rate (R ), if the rate is less than or equal to the rank of the channel matrix. In the new structure, only R transmit antennas at a time slot are engaged in signal transmission, and a different set of R transmit antennas at a different time slot is used. N t  data symbols are combined together using complex weights for each antenna at a time slot. The same set of data symbols is repeated at all the remaining time slots in a code block, but is transmitted through different transmit antennas using different sets of combining weights at different time slots. In particular, the above structure eliminates cross-code product terms in the determinant of codeword difference matrices when R  t , thus increasing the coding gain. In addition, we propose a simplified code structure to facilitate the code design, in which a higher-rate GOD STC can be obtained by coupling R rate-one codes using different rotations. We apply two design constraints such as the power and orthogonality constraints, and provide some guidelines to reduce further the design complexity. In conclusion, the proposed structure provides a higher coding gain as compared with the original GOD structure [ 1 ] and the existing linear dispersion STCs (LD-STCs), when R  t  and can reduce significantly the design complexity when the rate becomes higher and/or the number of transmit antennas gets larger."
444155,21212,8228,Coverage and channel characteristics of millimeter wave band using ray tracing,2015,"Utilization of millimeter wave (MMW) bands for supporting very high data rate cellular access has received much attention in recent times. The behavior of the wireless channel in these bands differ significantly from the sub-6 GHz counterparts. Ray tracing is a complementary effort to detailed measurements in providing quick insight into the coarse channel characteristics. In this paper, we model the 28 GHz outdoor channel through ray tracing using the WinProp tool. We simulate the single base station and multi base station scenarios in the downtown Manhattan area and study channel properties such as coverage and path loss, path diversity and delay spreads. We observe that a typical MMW base station provides coverage to a significant fraction of a 100m cell radius with path diversity, i.e. there exist secondary paths that may sustain the link on the failure of the first path. The improvements to coverage and path diversity with multiple base stations are also characterized. The above channel properties are compared with NYU's [4] results from the same region. We observe a reasonable match for many of the above parameters. The delay spreads with omni and beamformed antennas are also compared. The typical RMS delay spread in a beamformed scenario is seen to be in the order of 20–30 ns which is significantly smaller than the measured values of 100ns or more. This phenomenon is likely due to detailed clutter in the environment not being modeled."
2171529,21212,8228,Effect of routing convergence time on lightpath establishment in GMPLS-controlled WDM optical networks,2005,"In this paper we consider routing and wavelength assignment of primary and shared backup lightpaths using OSPF-TE routing information and CR-LDP signalling in GMPLS-based WDM optical mesh networks. In the emerging generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) based WDM transport networks, called intelligent optical transport networks, WDM-based optical components like add-drop multiplexers (ADMs) and optical cross connects (OXCs) will have full knowledge of the wavelengths in the network, status, and traffic carrying capacity of each wavelength. With such intelligence, these intelligent optical networks could create self-connecting and self-regulating connections on-the-fly. In these networks, after a lightpath establishment or release, the routing protocol may take considerable amount of time to update the routing database at all the nodes in the network, known as routing convergence time (T/sub o/). In case of dynamic traffic, where lightpath requests arrive to and depart from the network randomly; the routing and wavelength assignment for a new lightpath request may be carried out based on non-updated (old) link state information resulting in conflicts and hence leads to higher blocking probability. In this paper we evaluate the blocking performance for different scenarios, such as primary and shared backup lightpath establishment, with full and partial information. The simulation results show that the partial information case over performs the full information case with respect to connection blocking probability."
2007420,21212,8228,Applying simulated annealing for domain generation in ad hoc networks,2004,"If heterogeneous ad hoc battlefield networks are to scale to hundreds or thousands of nodes, then they must be automatically split into separate network domains. Domains allow routing, QoS and other networking protocols to operate on the fewer nodes. This division greatly reduces the overall overhead (e.g., routing overhead with n nodes that goes from O(n/sup 2/) to O(nlogn) and allows protocols to be tuned to more homogenous conditions (K. Manousakis et al., 2002). Domain generation (or clustering) can be done using either the local or global information. The two approaches are complementary since local domain generation reacts faster, requires less overhead, and is more robust while the global domain generation provides better overall domains. While the most existing work has concentrated on the local distributed solutions, this paper reports on the new global domain generation techniques. In particular we concentrate on the design of good cost functions and efficient optimization algorithms. We show that the simple intuitive cost functions do not produce good domains; rather we need complex functions with multiple parameters depending on the design goals (e.g., low overhead or low delay). Although existing optimization algorithms are too slow to be useful in a large dynamic network, we show that a modified simulated annealing algorithm with well chosen cooling schedule, state transition probabilities, and stop criteria produces good quality domains in acceptable time."
610041,21212,8228,Multiscale iterative LBG clustering for SIMO channel identification,2002,"This paper deals with the problem of channel identification for single input multiple output (SIMO) slow fading channels using clustering algorithms. The received data vectors of the SIMO model are spread in clusters because of the AWGN. Each cluster is centered around the ideal channel output labels without noise. Starting from the Markov SIMO channel model, simultaneous maximum-likelihood estimation of the input vector and the channel coefficients reduces to one of obtaining the values of this pair that minimizes the sum of the Euclidean norms between the received and the estimated output vectors. The Viterbi algorithm can be used for this purpose provided the trellis diagram of the Markov model can be labeled with the noiseless channel outputs. The problem of identification of the ideal channel outputs, which is the focus of this paper, is then equivalent to designing a vector quantizer (VQ) from a training set corresponding to the observed noisy channel outputs. The Linde-Buzo-Gray (1980) type clustering algorithms could be used to obtain the noiseless channel output labels from the noisy received vectors. This paper looks at two critical issues with regards to the use of VQ for channel identification. The first has to deal with the applicability of this technique in general. We present theoretical results showing the conditions under which the technique may be applicable. The second aims at overcoming the codebook initialization problem by proposing a novel approach which attempts to make the first phase of the channel estimation faster than the classical codebook initialization methods."
1705035,21212,8228,A heuristic evaluation PDS algorithm for energy-efficient delay constrained scheduling over wireless communication,2012,"Hard energy constraints impose huge challenges to wireless communication under the constraint of communication delay. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission scheduling of delay sensitive multimedia data over a fading channel. We first formulate the transmission scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and systematically unravel it by the optimal solution. We then propose a Heuristic Evaluation Post-decision State (HE-PDS) learning algorithm for the problem of energy-efficient scheduling with respect to the communication delay. This algorithm is based on reformulating the value iteration equation by introducing a virtual state called Post-decision State (PDS). The advantages of the proposed algorithm are that: (i) it exploits only part of the information about the system so that less information needs to be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; (ii) it uses the heuristic function and evaluation function to reduce unnecessary action exploration in the whole search space, which severely limits the adaptation speed and runtime performance of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; (iii) it chooses actions with favorable purpose and efficiency so as to optimize reward function and enhance convergence speed. We compare our algorithm with the traditional Q learning algorithm and PDS learning algorithm in terms of the energy consumption and transmission delay. The simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm under various scenarios achieves a better trade-off between energy consumption and delay overhead. Moreover, it can converge in a reasonable number of slots for it to be practically useful with satisfaction of delay constraint."
2208851,21212,8228,A Wavelet Based Long Range Signal Strength Prediction in Wireless Networks,2008,"Prediction of rapidly time varying fading channel conditions enables adaptive data transmissions in wireless systems, which in turn improves the quality of service for end users and reduces the power consumption for data transmissions. Most of the existing long range prediction methods for fast fading in wireless networks use autoregressive (AR) models and make the assumption that the input fading signal is stationary and wireless channel parameters vary slowly (S. Semmelrodt and R. Kattenbach, 2003). In this paper, we provide a method to predict the non-stationary received signal strength in a more realistic and fast varying wireless environment, using multiresolution wavelet analysis. We first use discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) to decompose the signal strength trace into components at different scales, then use AR and linear regression models to predict small, medium and large scale fading components respectively, and finally synthesize the output signal of our prediction algorithm. By properly choosing the wavelet basis, we map the non-stationary signal strength trace into stationary wavelet detail coefficients and use them as input to the AR predictor at different scales. Longer prediction range is easily achieved by choosing the appropriate maximum decomposition scale, while still achieving low prediction error. Our experimental results shows that our wavelet based algorithm outperforms existing time-domain AR prediction methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational complexity."
3045866,21212,10228,Switch-On/Off Policies for Energy Harvesting Small Cells through Distributed Q-Learning,2017,"The massive deployment of small cells (SCs) represents one of the most promising solutions adopted by 5G cellular networks to meet the foreseen huge traffic demand. The high number of network elements entails a significant increase in the energy consumption. The usage of renewable energies for powering the small cells can help reduce the environmental impact of mobile networks in terms of energy consumption and also save on electric bills. In this paper, we consider a two-tier cellular network architecture where SCs can offload macro base stations and solely rely on energy harvesting and storage. In order to deal with the erratic nature of the energy arrival process, we exploit an ON/OFF switching algorithm, based on reinforcement learning, that autonomously learns energy income and traffic demand patterns. The algorithm is based on distributed multi-agent Q-learning for jointly optimizing the system performance and the self-sustainability of the SCs. We analyze the algorithm by assessing its convergence time, characterizing the obtained ON/OFF policies, and evaluating an offline trained variant. Simulation results demonstrate that our solution is able to increase the energy efficiency of the system with respect to simpler approaches. Moreover, the proposed method provides an harvested energy surplus, which can be used by mobile operators to offer ancillary services to the smart electricity grid."
2044551,21212,8228,Spectrum Management Strategies for Efficient UMTS Integration in Wireless beyond 3G Infrastructures,2006,"The future of telecommunications is depicted on the convergence of mobile systems and IP networks, towards a global communications system, operating over a common access infrastructure, namely the Beyond the 3rd Generation (B3G) wireless access infrastructure. The goal of this vision is the ubiquitous delivery of a great variety of innovative services, via a multitude of Radio Access Technologies (RATs). To achieve this, it is mandatory to identify and embrace the requirements for support of heterogeneity in wireless technologies. Framed within such context is the efficient management of each distinct RAT's resources (e.g. spectrum, codes, power levels etc) within the heterogeneous environment. Accordingly, this paper considers the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) as one of the most common operating RATs in B3G environments, and focuses on the efficient management of the total spectrum assigned to UMTS Network Providers (NPs). Specifically, the method proposed herewith, called Demand Allocation into Multiple UMTS Carriers (DAMUC), aims at finding the optimum partitioning of the demand to the multiple available, wideband UMTS carrier frequencies owned by a single NP. The method investigates certain demand allocation policies and selects the most appropriate one in terms of minimizing the total downlink power consumption in the network. Validation and consolidation can be ensured through indicative results from the application of DAMUC to a simulated network."
339189,21212,8228,A MIH and SDN-based Framework for network selection in 5G HetNet: Backhaul requirement perspectives,2015,"Cell sizes of the Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile networks grow inexorably smaller because of the massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and millimeter wave communication technologies to be used. It is therefore challenging to address the mobility management, especially vertical handover in 5G networks. In this paper, an intelligent vertical handover framework is proposed and discussed to simplify the network selection, and to reduce the handover latency and frequency. Integrating Media-independent handover (MIH) and Software-defined network (SDN) technologies, the core of our design is to ensure the handover happens between only two potential networks regardless of the available types of technologies. For this purpose, we exploit three types of handover information with a new pre-selection scheme to eliminate unqualified networks and generate a network ranking. Moreover, with the introduction of steady period, we use the feature of SDN to deliver the best two candidate networks to the two-dimensional (2D) cost function module for the final decision. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can accurately select the optimal network in an efficient manner even if a number of access technologies exist. Furthermore, our framework reduces the vast backhaul traffic during a vertical handover process and keeps the backhaul energy consumption low. Eventually, simulation also shows superiority when the cell sizes are diverse."
1290067,21212,8228,QoE-aware congestion control algorithm for conversational services,2012,"Nowadays, multimedia applications and specifically streaming systems over wireless networks use the TCP transport protocol. Indeed, TCP can deal with practical issues such as firewalls and also deploys built-in retransmissions and congestion control mechanisms. We propose in this paper a Quality-centric Mean Opinion Score (MOS) based congestion control that determines an optimal congestion window updating policy for multimedia transmission. Unlike the standard congestion control algorithms, our approach defines a new Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm given the multimedia application and the transmission characteristics. In order to get the optimal congestion policy in practice, the sender requires complete statistical knowledge of both multimedia traffic and the network environment, which may not be available in wireless systems. Hence, we propose in this paper, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework in order to determine an optimal congestion control policy which maximizes the long term expected Quality of Experience (QoE) of the receiver. Moreover, the computation of an optimal policy is usually time/process consuming and as wireless devices are capacity-limited, we consider optimal solutions based on temporal difference (TD-λ) online learning algorithms. Finally, we do some practical experiments of our algorithms on a Microsoft Lync testbed. We observe that our algorithm improve significantly the QoE compared to standard AIMD congestion control mechanism."
1950470,21212,8228,Adaptive allocation of resources with multiple QoS heterogenous sources in ATM networks - a fuzzy approach,2002,"One of the major challenges in ATM based B-ISDN is to guarantee the promised QoS for all the admitted users, while maximising the resource utilization through dynamic resource sharing. In the case of a multimedia call, each of its substreams has its own distinct QoS requirements. The network attempts to deliver the required QoS by allocating an appropriate amount of resources to the admitted calls. Bandwidth allocation play a key role in achieving the promised QoS for every connection or every class of connection. There are dynamic bandwidth allocation polices reported in the literature, but they deal with homogeneous sources viz., video sources only. These dynamic algorithms do not deal with the QoS parameters, and also the main drawback of these schemes is that they lead to unequal queue growth. We present and analyse dynamic bandwidth allocation based on fuzzy logic for heterogenous sources with multiple QoS requirements. We consider that each substream declares a present range of acceptable QoS levels instead of just a single one. As the QoS demand varies, the proposed algorithm allocates the best possible bandwidth to the substream. This is done under the constraint of achieving maximum utilization of resources while simultaneously distributing them fairly among the calls. We validate the proposed allocation method for various heterogenous traffic profiles with various bit rates and QoS parameters and show that the required QoS can be satisfied by appropriately tuning the fuzzy logic controller from the declared QoS parameters and instantaneous traffic arrivals."
2420417,21212,8228,A proposal on design scheme of TMN NEML management application framework for ATM switching systems,1997,"The TMN concept is the most common idea for implementing integrated network management system (INMS). TMN specifications provide a framework for telecommunication management through generic managed object models and the standard interfaces. So, it is possible to operate heterogeneous networks and NEs through TMN consistently. But, it is not easy to implement and adapt the TMN concept to real telecommunication management fields. All of the managed targets are redesigned as managed objects(MO), and the MOs also should be extended for just fit to real management resources. Furthermore, some management application components should be designed as supported MOs to support the management functions. We have to handle the MOs in association with UNIX processes/threads, and CMIP, ACSE, ROSE and communication infra protocols (e.g. ATM, TCP/IP, X.25, etc). Before everything else, the most important thing that we have to develop is to organize them into an integrally operable management application framework (MAFW). All of TMN management scenarios are implemented with management application functions (MAF), and should be comprised in the MAFWs. In this paper, we propose the functional role-based layered API architecture for the construction of the MAFWs. The MAFW is to support the extensible and adaptable management service environments. To ensure the extensibility and the adaptability, we design the MAFW as a task oriented layered API architecture. This architecture allows the distributed processing capability to several workstations and even scattered administration sites. The conceptual strategy proposed in this paper might be a basic methodology to adapt any managed targets into TMN infrastructure or any integrated network management domain for developers or engineers."
1501249,21212,8228,On identifying which intermediate nodes should code in multicast networks,2013,"Network coding has the potential to enhance energy efficiency of multicast sessions by providing optimal communication subgraphs for the transmission of the data. However, the coding requirement at intermediate nodes may introduce additional complexity and energy consumption in order to code the data packets. Previous work has shown that in lossless wireline networks, the performance of tree-packing mechanisms is comparable to network coding, albeit with added complexity at the time of computing the trees. This means that most nodes in the network need not code. Thus, mechanisms that identify intermediate nodes that do require coding is instrumental for the efficient operation of coded networks and can have a significant impact in overall energy consumption. We present a distributed, low complexity algorithm that allows every node to identify if it should code and, if so, through what output link should the coded packets be sent. Our algorithm uses as input the optimal subgraph determined by Lun et al's optimization formulation [13]. Numerical results are provided using common Internet Service Provider (ISP) network topologies and also random network deployments. Our results show that the number of coding nodes in the expectation is very low (typically below 1) and that the number of sessions that require coding is limited, e.g., less than 15% for sessions of 4 receivers for the ISP networks and below 0.1% for networks with random node deployments in a square of 1 × 1 km 2  with of up to 30 nodes and up to 20 receivers."
2170838,21212,8228,Avoiding blocking in multilayer recovery,2004,"With more options to recover traffic provided, based on services survivability requirements, providing an integrated recovery solution becomes critical. Layering has been a key driver in allowing network devices and technologies geared to carrying new types of services such as IP traffic over existing networks. Also, it has allowed networks to increase capacity by converting SONET to wavelengths. Providing connectivity is a key function of recovery, no matter what the layer. We expect that recovery capabilities will be added to client layers such as IP and MPLS and to server layers such as WDM. A primary goal of recovery is for all services traversing a failed link to be restored in a way consistent with businesses requirements. Inconsistent provisioning will prevent this. Furthermore, since recovery can occur at a different time than when it is provisioned, inconsistent provisioning is really determined after the fact, with services left unrepaired or repaired unnecessarily and at extra cost. Double redundancy will let different layers operate on the same traffic because of the containment relationship of units of traffic called encapsulation. In other words, recovery operates twice. We can ensure recovery meets a global perspective on how traffic should be restored by simply checking the provisioning at each device and checking suitable properties of a formal representation. In this paper, we propose a mapping from command-line interfaces to a topological representation that will allow us to check if provisioning is consistent."
444637,21212,8228,10 GHz channel spacing ultra-dense WDM networks transparently extended by mm-wave coherent RoF links,2015,"The extension of ultra-dense WDM passive optical networks (PONs) by millimetre-wave coherent radio-over-fiber (RoF) links is investigated. For a seamless and transparent integration of the RoF links coherent heterodyne detection is used for the generation of the wireless RF signals out of the optical baseband data signals. Simulations of the optical SIR in the PON are carried out in dependence on the WDM channel spacing. The projected impact on the transmission quality is derived and WDM CRoF experiments are performed. In the experiments three data modulated optical channels are transmitted over 10 km SMF to simulate the PON, before arriving at the E-band radio access unit (RAU). The RAU utilizes heterodyne detection with an optical LO for converting the 1 Gb/s optical baseband signal to a 75 GHz RF signal. After 40 m wireless transmission the signal is received by an antenna and downconverted to baseband using a low-cost SBD based receiver for envelope detection. The filtering of WDM channels with an optical channel spacing of down to 10 GHz showed very little penalty versus single channel transmission, relying only on the filter characteristic of the used LNAs and antennas and using no optical filters. Still the receiver's sensitivity is only −57 dBm for a bit error rate (BER) of 2·10 −3 , thus it is shown that an ultra-dense WDM PON can be extended wirelessly using coherent RoF techniques without the need for optical filtering."
2073367,21212,8228,Distributed scheduling and power control for cognitive spatial-reuse TDMA networks,2012,"We investigate the problem of distributed scheduling and power control for vertical spectrum sharing in spatial-reuse time division multiple access (STDMA) networks. The objective is to minimize the transmission length (in term of time slots) of secondary users (e.g. users in femtocell networks) subject to the interference-limit constraint for primary users (e.g. users in cellular networks) and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee of secondary users. This problem is known to be NP-complete. We therefore propose a novel distributed two-stage algorithm based on the distributed column generation method to find the near-optimal solution for the transmission schedule. In the first stage, the dual problem corresponding to the transmission length minimization problem subject to the minimum bandwidth requirement of secondary users, called the restricted master problem, is solved to obtain a dual optimal solution at each secondary transmitter. The dual optimal variables are passed to the second stage to solve the pricing problem. The pricing problem here finds a feasible channel access pattern such that the sum of dual optimal variables is greater than 1 subject to the interference constraints for primary users and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for secondary users so that the solution of the master restricted problem can be improved. We also develop a distributed algorithm for solving the pricing problem based on local measurement at each secondary transmitter and a limited number of message exchanges. The proposed algorithm is compared with previously proposed methods and is evaluated in terms of the schedule length and the number of message exchanges."
285079,21212,8228,Human activity analysis for in-home fall risk assessment,2015,"The aim of this work is to define a fall detection video system for indoor environments based on a RGB-D sensor and a low power and low cost embedded system that processes the sensor data in order to provide a description of human activities in the field of the Ambient Assisted Living. The RGB image is affected by a high luminescence sensibility, so the depth data have the aim to improve the human activity recognition. The system is usable in a sufficiently small room and it requires a RGB-D sensor located in the center of the ceiling and an embedded system connected on a computer network. The embedded system controls the RGB-D sensor and, in the mean time, classifies the images using computer vision algorithms based on the depth map. “Water Filling” algorithm or “Multi-Level Segmentation” algorithm are used to detect person. For each person, the system detects the position with respect to the room, estimating also the human posture. Among the features extracted we enumerate the height, the head size and the distance between the head and the shoulders. The system tracks a person through the frames starting from the first identification. Further, group interactions are monitored and analyzed. The posture detection algorithm takes into account the distance between the person head and the floor during the time. During the experimental phase, conducted in many domestic scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed solution has been proved, that is fast, accurate and ables to provide a fall map in-home fall risk assessment."
298771,21212,8228,End-to-end informed VM selection in compute clouds,2015,"The selection of resources, particularly VMs, in current public IaaS clouds is usually done in a blind fashion, as cloud users do not have much information about resource consumption by co-tenant third-party tasks. In particular, communication patterns can play a significant part in cloud application performance and responsiveness, specially in the case of novel latency-sensitive applications, increasingly common in today's clouds. Thus, herein we propose an end-to-end approach to the VM allocation problem using policies based uniquely on round-trip time measurements between VMs. Those become part of a user-level ‘Recommender Service’ that receives VM allocation requests with certain network-related demands and matches them to a suitable subset of VMs available to the user within the cloud. We propose and implement end-to-end algorithms for VM selection that cover desirable profiles of communications between VMs in distributed applications in a cloud setting, such as profiles with prevailing pair-wise, hub-and-spokes, or clustered communication patterns between constituent VMs. We quantify the expected benefits from deploying our Recommender Service by comparing our informed VM allocation approaches to conventional, random allocation methods, based on real measurements of latencies between Amazon EC2 instances. We also show that our approach is completely independent from cloud architecture details, is adaptable to different types of applications and workloads, and is lightweight and transparent to cloud providers."
324294,21212,8228,More spectrum for less energy: Green cooperative sensing scheduling in CRNs,2015,"Due to the increasing bandwidth demand of mobile users and their devices with energy hungry wireless networking modules, attention of research efforts has been recently shifting to find answers to the paradox of achieving more spectrum for less energy consumption. In this paper, cognitive radios have been employed to obtain more spectrum by utilizing unused licensed spectrum in an opportunistic manner. Defining the opportunity cost as the consumed energy per achieved unit of free spectrum, we propose a cooperative sensing scheduling framework to optimize the cost with the consideration of the sensing, reporting and channel switching costs in terms of energy expenditure subject to a licensed user protection threshold. In the proposed scheme, all primary channels are scheduled to be cooperatively sensed within a cycle which consists of rounds. In every round, secondary/unlicensed users (SUs) are first assigned to cooperatively sense the scheduled primary/licensed user (PU) channels. Consequently, SUs report their local sensing results to a fusion center for a global decision. Finally, SUs assigned to sense other PU channels perform channel switching for the next round. This scheme not only provides a feasible network set up in case there does not exist a sufficient number of SUs to satisfy the PU protection in a single round, but also offers an apparent reduction in the opportunity cost."
329106,21212,8228,Delay performance analysis of cooperative cell caching in future mobile networks,2015,"Due to the exponentially increasing demands for multimedia services over recent years, the growing network traffic load becomes a severe concern for the mobile network operators (MNOs). However, the wireless link capacity, the radio access networks, and MNOs' backhaul networks cannot deal with the traffic load effectively. To solve this problem, content caching is regarded as an effective emerging technique to reduce the duplicated transmissions of the content downloads demanded by mobile users and improve users' quality of service (QoS). Therefore, in this paper, we mainly focus on the cooperative cell caching for future mobile networks, where each cell (e.g., base station) can cache popular contents for improving QoS especially on the overall delay performance of users. The task is formulated as a problem of minimizing the expected overall user delay of accessing the demanded contents. Instead of rewriting it as a non-linear and non-convex problem based on an approximate transformation, we convert it to a linear programming problem by using a novel equivalent transformation. To solve the problem, rather than using the existing branchand-bound (BNB) method, which suffers from exponential-time and exponential-space complexity, we propose a new distributed suboptimal algorithm, which has polynomial-time and linearspace complexity. Numerical evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed cooperative cell caching framework can reduce the expected overall delay significantly."
311319,21212,8228,Novel retransmission scheme for energy harvesting transmitter and receiver,2015,"We consider a point-to-point wireless link with automatic repeat request (ARQ) based packet transmission where both the transmitter and receiver nodes are energy harvesting (EHNs). Transmitter EHN has access to low-grade channel state information (CSI) as it is implicitly obtained from ARQ feedback. Furthermore, signal processing tasks such as sampling and decoding at the receiver EHN can be interrupted if there is insufficient energy in the battery that cause loss of packet and wastage of harvested energy both at the transmitter and receiver EHNs. We propose selective sampling (SS) scheme where only part of the transmitted packet is sampled and stored depending on the receiver nodes stored energy. SS information (SSI) is then fed back to the transmitter. Packet decoding is not performed until full packet is constructed. Hence, we modify the conventional ARQ messages, i.e., ACK/NAK by adding few more bits to carry additional SSI as well. Another objective is to find the optimal power allocation policy to adapt to the low-grade CSI and SSI available at the transmitter such that harvested energy can be utilized efficiently especially at the receiver. Furthermore, using a decision-theoretic framework, we propose greedy power allocation scheme to evaluate the performance of the proposed retransmission scheme. In numerical examples, we illustrate that our proposed scheme has lower average packet transmission time and packet drop probability (PDP) compared to the equal power allocation and greedy power allocation with conventional retransmission scheme."
1850288,21212,8228,Error Exponents for Multi-Source Multi-Relay Parallel Relay Networks with Limited Backhaul Capacity,2011,"In this paper, we assess the random coding error exponents (EEs) corresponding to decode-and-forward (DF), compress-and-forward (CF) and quantize-and-forward (QF) relaying strategies for a parallel relay network (PRN), consisting of two sources, two relay stations (RSs) and single destination where the RSs access to the destination via orthogonal, error-free, limited-capacity backhaul links. Among these relaying strategies, the DF and QF studied in this paper differ from their well-known conventional versions in certain aspects. In the DF relaying, each RS applies maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and sends the message corresponding to the detected signal along with a reliability information to the destination which finalize the decision on the transmitted message. In QF relaying, as opposed to the Gaussian codebook and vector quantization (VQ) theoretical model used for deriving bounds, we consider a simple and practical relaying strategy consisting of finite-alphabet constellations (i.e., M-QAM) at the sources and symbol-by-symbol uniform scalar quantizers (uSQs) at the RSs. We also show, through numerical analysis, that the proposed QF relaying can provide better EEs than the others when the modulation constellation sizes selected by the sources match to the network conditions, i.e., operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the backhaul capacity is sufficient. This behavior is due to the structure inherent in the considered modulation alphabets, which Gaussian signaling lacks."
1456018,21212,8228,Cooperative spectrum sensing with Slepian-Wolf coded cooperations,2012,"A new Slepian-Wolf coded cooperation scheme is proposed for a cognitive radio network with two secondary users (SUs) performing cooperative spectrum sensing through a fusion center (FC). The SUs sense the spectrum by measuring the energy statistics of the received signals. The measured energy statistics are quantized with a Lloyd-Max quantizer at the SUs and forwarded to the FC, which then performs soft combining over the quantized information. This is different from most previous works that forward hard decisions based on local sensing results at the SUs. Due to the wireless nature of the channel, signals transmitted by one SU to the FC will also be observed by the other SU, which can cooperate with the transmitting SU by relaying the observed signals to the FC. In recognition of the strong correlation between the signals observed at the FC and the relay SU, a new asymmetric Slepian-Wolf code is employed at the relay SU to reduce the amount of cooperation information, thus to improve the cooperation efficiency. In addition, we propose to unequally allocate energy among the coded bits to compensate the energy loss due to the redundancy introduced by the coded cooperation, and this yields better performance compared to conventional equal energy coding schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme operating in practical fading channels can achieve a performance that is almost identical to the ideal case with soft combining performed over unquantized energy statistics transmitted through distortion-free channels."
2656364,21212,8228,Compressed sensing-based pilot assignment and reuse for mobile UEs in mmWave cellular systems,2016,"Technologies for millimeter wave (mmWave) communication are at the forefront of investigations in both industry and academia, as the mmWave band offers the promise of orders of magnitude additional available bandwidths to what has already been allocated to cellular networks. The much larger number of antennas that can be supported in a small footprint at mmWave bands can be leveraged to harvest massive-MIMO type beamforming and spatial multiplexing gains. Similar to Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems, two prerequisites for harvesting these benefits are detecting users and acquiring user channel state information (CSI) in the training phase. However, due to the fact that mmWave channels encounter much harsher propagation and decorrelate much faster, the tasks of user detection and CSI acquisition are both imperative and much more challenging than in LTE bands. In this paper, we investigate the problem of fast user detection and CSI acquisition in the downlink of small cell mmWave networks. We assume Time Division Duplex (TDD) operation and channel-reciprocity based CSI acquisition. To achieve densification benefits we propose pilot designs and channel estimators that leverage a combination of aggressive pilot reuse with fast user detection at the base station and compressed sensing channel estimation. As our simulations show, the number of users that can be simultaneously served by the entire mmWave-band network with the proposed schemes increases substantially with respect to traditional compressed sensing based approaches with conventional pilot reuse."
2877296,21212,8228,H.265 video capacity over beyond-4G networks,2016,"Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been standardized by the 3GPP consortium since 2008 in 3GPP Release 8, with 3GPP Release 12 being the latest iteration of LTE Advanced (LTE-A), which was finalized in March 2015. High Efficiency Video Coding (H.265) has been standardized by MPEG since 2012 and is the Video Compression technology targeted to deliver High-Definition (HD) and Ultra High-Definition (UHD) Video Content to users. With video traffic projected to represent the lion's share of mobile data traffic, providing users with high Quality of Experience (QoE) is key to designing 4G systems and future 5G systems. In this paper, we present a cross-layer scheduling framework which delivers frames to unicast video users by exploiting the encoding features of H.265. We extract information on frame references within the coded video bitstream to determine which frames have higher utility for the H.265 decoder located at the user's device and evaluate the performances of best-effort and video users in 4G networks using finite buffer traffic models. Our results demonstrate that there is significant potential to improve the QoE of all users compared to the baseline Proportional Fair method by adding media-awareness in the scheduling entity at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of a Radio Access Network (RAN)."
2249271,21212,8228,Stable Queue Management for Supporting TCP Flows over Wireless Networks,2011,"Congestion control for wireless networks is much more challenging than that for wired networks, due to the limited wireless spectrum and severe impairments of wireless medium which suffer time-varying fading, shadowing, interference, etc. Although the stability of the Internet using TCP congestion control and active queue management (AQM) schemes has been extensively investigated, effective congestion control for wireless networks is a pressing, open issue. Considering the dynamics of wireless links, in this paper, we investigate the stability of TCP/AQM wireless networks with feedback delays, which is formulated as a delay Markov jump linear system (DMJLS). First, a dynamic model based on the DMJLS for TCP/AQM wireless networks is established. Second, a novel stochastic stability analysis for autonomous time-delay systems with a cost function is presented. Delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) criteria for the stochastic stability conditions are obtained. It is noteworthy that this is the first time conditions for the stochastic stability have been derived subject to the linear quadratic (LQ) control strategy, and packet drop probability as the control input under the DMJLS is calculated. In addition, for practical systems where real-time tracking of states is infeasible or costly, the mode-independent congestion control is also investigated. The robustness of random early detection (RED) in wireless environment is proved. Numerical results are given to validate the analytical results which provide important insights for wireless network congestion control and resource management."
489888,21212,8228,Lagrangian relaxation for the time-dependent combined network design and routing problem,2015,"In communication networks, the routing decision process (distributed and online) remains decoupled from the network design process, i.e., resource installation and allocation planning process (centralized and offline). To reconcile both processes, we ambition to design a distributed optimization technique aware of distributed nature of the routing process by decomposing the optimization problem along same dimensions as (distributed) routing decision process. For this purpose, we generalize the capacitated multi-commodity capacitated fixed charge network design (MCND) class of problems by including different types of fixed costs (installation and maintenance costs) and variable costs (routing costs) but also variable traffic demands over multiple periods. However, conventional integer programming methods can typically solve only small to medium size instances. As an alternative, we propose a Lagrangian approach for computing a lower bound by relaxing the flow conservation constraints such that the Lagrangian subproblem itself decomposes by node. Though this approach yields one subproblem per network node, solving the Lagrangian dual by means of the bundle method remains a complex computational tasks. However, the approach is more robust than any LP solvers and it always returns some solutions. Instead, we proved that CPLEX, which uses the Dual Simplex algorithm, is not able to provide a solution for large instances."
544363,21212,8228,Bayesian Coalition Game-based optimized clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks,2015,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years because these are being used in wide range of applications. A collection of randomly/planned deployed tiny Sensor Nodes (SNs) can perform the task according to the need of a specific application. Utilization of energy of SNs is one of the key issues in these networks as nodes are battery operated and recharge or replacement of battery is a difficult task to be achieved. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian Coalition Game-based optimized clustering in WSNs. To formulate the game, we propose a new Hybrid Homogeneous LEACH (HHO-LEACH) protocol for SNs in WSNs. We have used the concepts of Learning Automata (LA), and Bayesian Coalition Game (BCG) in which SNs are assumed as the players in the game with dynamic thresholds-based coalition formation among themselves, i.e., coalition among the nodes are formed using distance-based thresholds which makes a partition of the network field. SNs near to base station use direct communication for data transfer with or without single hop to the Base Station(BS) after interacting with the environment. During this process, each player may get a reward, or a penalty with respect to the finite number of actions performed. Performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated using extensive simulations by selecting various evaluation metrics. The results obtained show that proposed coalition game achieved better stability, and network lifetime in comparison to other existing protocols such as LEACH, and DD."
2168843,21212,8228,Overview of a Software Defined Downlink Inner Receiver for Category-E LTE-Advanced UE,2011,"With the soaring development cost of deep sub-micron silicon and the fast-growing diversity in wireless communications, software defined baseband becomes more and more important for handheld devices. However, most software defined receivers reported in previous literatures are still far away from fulfilling the requirement of emerging wireless standards such as the LTE-Advanced. The category-E User Equipment (UE) defined in LTE-Advanced, as the most demanding category for handheld devices, requires processing 2 concurrent data streams at around 300Mbps aggregated throughput. It is not clear whether SDR baseband processors can tackle this challenge. In our work, we explore the feasibility for software defined baseband for LTE-Advanced. With a highly customized SDR baseband processor, we have recently accomplished a software defined downlink inner receiver for Category-E LTE-Advanced UE. The implemented inner receiver includes fully fledged synchronization and data detection functionalities, including coarse CFO estimation/compensation, I/Q imbalance estimation/compensation, OFDMA demodulation, channel estimation, fine SCO/CFO estimation/compensation, MIMO channel processing, MIMO data detection and LLR generation. This paper is intended to bring an overview for the work and emphasizes key aspects that enable the feasibility of the work. In this paper, we will introduce the algorithm and processor architecture co-design flow, overall receiver functionalities, important optimizations and implementation results."
1567568,21212,8228,Supporting monitoring applications with mobile Wireless Sensor Networks: The eN Route forwarding approach,2012,"This work focuses on providing effective end-to-end (E2E) communications for critical monitoring applications through Wireless Sensor Networks. In particular, the case of frequent disconnection and reconnection has been analyzed, deriving effective routing strategies to cope with this problem. Basing on a recent IETF draft scheme, namely RPL, capable of accommodating several practical situations, a novel approach, called eN Route (NR), has been proposed. In particular, it relies on a two tier network architecture with a hybrid tree-mesh topology, which can be locally rearranged depending on link failures, mainly due to mobility. This is done in a completely distributed way by maintaining a specific neighbor table built only by sniffing data messages to not increase the signaling overhead. The proposed solutions functionalities have been described and compared in terms of connectivity efficiency, E2E path length distribution and E2E latency statistic, giving also some figures on overhead. The analyses have shown NR to achieve better results in in terms of network connectivity latency and overhead, despite some drawbacks, even though RPL is able to achieve comparable performance at the expenses of higher signaling overhead. As a consequence, it has been pointed out the way RPL future releases can profit from NR approach to improve performance."
1828858,21212,8228,A Discrete-Time Polynomial Model of Single Channel Long-Haul Fiber-Optic Communication Systems,2011,"To mitigate various physical impairments of long-haul dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems and exploit their system capacity, there is a need to develop a two-dimensional (time and wavelength) discrete-time input-output model which can become the foundation of signal processing for optical communications. As the first step, this paper develops a model for single channel multipulse multispan systems based on the Volterra series transfer function (VSTF) method. This model is suitable for high-bit-rate time-division multiplexing (TDM) transmission in the pseudo-linear regime and is easily extendable to the multichannel case. We overcome the well-known triple integral problem and reduce it to a simple integral. This model takes into account fiber losses, frequency chirp and photodetection, which are ignored in the literature. Furthermore, with this model we introduce the intersymbol interference (ISI), self phase modulation (SPM), intrachannel cross phase modulation (IXPM) and intrachannel four wave mixing (IFWM) coefficients to characterize the impact of these effects on the system performance. The model is in excellent agreement with SSF (split-step Fourier) simulation. To illustrate its application, we develop a constrained coding scheme based on the system model to suppress the impact of various impairments."
2811317,21212,8228,Joint source-relay selection in two-way full-duplex relay network,2016,"We investigate the outage probability of a variablegain amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network. A multi-source multi-relay network is considered with one destination and twoway traffic, where each node is equipped with two antennas and works on a full-duplex (FD) transmission mode. Meanwhile, the number of sources and relays is M and N, respectively. The residual self-interference, leaking from the full-duplex node's output to its input, exists in each node, and selective combing is performed at the source and the destination. In particular, we propose a practical joint source-relay selection scheme for this network, aiming to harvest selective diversity and power gain for reliable transmission. Unlike the existing schemes, we take the direct link from the source to the destination into consideration; therefore, it bears the potential to improve system stability. The proposed scheme only needs the local channel state information (CSI), and can be operated in a distributed manner. Furthermore, we derive a tight closed-form lower bound for the outage probability with the proposed scheme, and a simple asymptotic expression is also obtained with clear insights into the achievable diversity order. Our analysis shows that full cooperative diversity gain is achievable with the proposed scheme, and the selection on sources provides additional power gain. Finally, numerical results consolidate our theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."
2374199,21212,8228,S.T.R.E.S.S. : Stress Testing and Reverse Engineering for System Security,2007,"In modern wireless networks the functions included into layer II have to deal with complex problems, such as security and access control, that were previously demanded to upper layers. This growing complexity led some vendors to implement layer II primitives directly in software, e.g. IEEE 802.111 has been largely distributed as a software patch to be used with legacy 802.11b/g hardware. In any extremely complex software the likelihood of committing errors during the implementation raises, and it is well known that software bugs can lead to instability of the system and possibly to security vulnerability. Software bugs are the most common cause of successful attacks against any kind of network and represent a real plague for system administrators. Stress test is a widely used methodology to find and eliminate software bugs. In this paper we present a platform to perform a stress test of generic network protocols implementations but especially optimized for Layer II stress tests, that present specific problems. With our approach a generic network protocol described with ABNF language can be tested transmitting arbitrary frame sequences and interpreting the responses to verify consistence with the communication standard used. Our platform can interact dynamically with the tested machine (an access point, a router etc.) to verify its robustness and its compliance with the standard. Experiments confirmed the validity of our approach both as a stress test technique for system under development and as a reverse engineering technique for interaction with closed source system."
325004,21212,8228,A novel optimum SINR beamforming in flat fading macrocells,2002,"In the array processing literature several statistically optimum beamformers have been proposed, to cope with the problem of optimal source separation. Optimum signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) beamforming is probably one of the best techniques because it can circumvent most of the drawbacks of other beamforming techniques, but, in many already proposed approaches, the knowledge of the correlation matrices of the desired and the interference signals, is simply assumed. Unfortunately, the estimation might not be easily evaluated in practical scenarios wherein both kind of signals are simultaneously present at the receiver. In this paper we propose a novel direction of arrival (DOA) driven statistically optimum SINR beamformer whose aim is to exploit the inherent structure of the signal space. The beamformer response is optimized in such a way that power contributions of signals belonging to the desired signal subset (DSS) are maximized at the beamformer output, while power contributions of signals belonging to the complementary subset, named the rejected signal subset (RSS) and to the noise are minimized. In addition, a practical way to estimate the correlation matrices of desired and rejected signals is also provided, along with a closed form of the optimum weight vector characterizing the beamformer. This proposed technique yields to a family of SINR optimum beamformers, parameterized by different partitions of the DOA set. Another important feature of our technique is its inherent modularity, that makes it suitable for a parallel hardware implementation, so that real-time applications can be carried out."
462728,21212,8228,A packet-level model for MIMO spatial multiplexing channels in indoor environments,2015,"Directional transmission and reception using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies allows spatial multiplexing in a wireless network. However, multipath propagations in radio channels usually result in the angular spread of signal power, which causes interference among the sectors. Moreover, the random movement of the nodes leads to the variation of the interference. An accurate and mathematically tractable packet-level channel model is a key issue to evaluate the capacity and performance of the spatial multiplexing networks. In this paper, we have considered an indoor mobile ad hoc network where the sink node is equipped with an antenna array for beamforming. First, based on the angular power spectral density (APSD) of the indoor channels obtained by our field measurements, the interference among two nodes is evaluated. Second, by assuming two-dimensional random walk of the network nodes, a finite state Markov chain (FSMC) model is proposed to present the random variation of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the directional links from the nodes to the sink. The closed-form expressions of the state transition probabilities and steady state distributions are derived. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the channel evolution process. The proposed packet-level channel model can be conveniently incorporated into analytical frameworks and fast simulations of upper-layer network protocols."
2073636,21212,8228,A dynamic reconfiguring tool for improving multiwavelength transport network robustness,1997,"In this paper we present a heuristic tool known as the virtual permanent reconfiguring mechanism (VPRM) which dynamically reconfigures wavelength connections in a WDM transport network with a given physical topology. VPRM seeks to provide an optimised semi-permanent solution of the network configuration or logical topology, and traffic flow of a WDM transport network. The tool is activated in the event of changes within network environment; these may include: (i) normal network environment changes such as a change in traffic pattern, network expansion (introduction of new nodes or increase in wavelength availability) and line shutdown for maintenance purposes and, (ii) abnormal network environment changes such as sudden power failure, and network faults. Detection of the former network changes is achieved using a threshold detection technique. The latter, changes however are detected by means of fault alarm signals from distributed fault restoration mechanisms. The VPRM employs a combination of integer linear programming (ILP) and a heuristic approach. It essentially balances the traffic utilisation throughout the network physical structure and it dynamically ensures that spare connections are available, even after a fault, prior to completion of network maintenance. Unlike other reconfiguration techniques which involve solving ILP problems, the VPRM not only balances the load distribution throughout the physical network but also reduces the overall mean traffic level within each link."
2171486,21212,8228,UKF Based Iterative Joint Channel Estimation for Uplink Two Dimensional Block Spread Wireless Networks,2011,"Applications for future broadband wireless network should work effectively under highly dynamic wireless channel environment, where strong frequency-selective and time-selective fading and severe multi-path channels will exist. Though some advantage techniques, such as 2-dimensional (2D) block spread, frequency domain equalization (FDE) and antenna diversity techniques, can be applied to the code division multiple access (CDMA) networks to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance, they all require an accurate estimation of the channel. Conventional channel estimation method such as the minimum mean square errors (MMSE) based channel estimation scheme may not be applicable because its performance degrades significantly when the channel dynamics become severe. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based iterative channel estimation method, which is jointly used with the MMSE channel estimation scheme, to track the channel dynamics in both time domain and frequency domain. Hence, better estimation accuracy of the fast fading channels can be achieved. Furthermore, we utilize cyclic iteration to ensure UKF converge to the stable result accurately and quickly, and the iteration count can be adjusted according to the Doppler effects. Our performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed joint estimation method can achieve good BER performance under both low and high dynamic channel conditions. It is much better than the pure MMSE based channel estimation method, and is very close to results from an ideal channel estimator."
2260243,21212,8228,An architectural framework to deploy scatternet-based applications over Bluetooth,2003,"Bluetooth is a promising wireless personal area network technology and is on the verge of being ubiquitously deployed over a wide range of devices. The basic unit of a Bluetooth network is a centralized master-slave topology, namely a piconet, that can be easily extended into a multi-hop ad hoc network called a scatternet. Scatternets increase Bluetooth's usability multi-folds such that numerous applications may be built over them to unleash the potential of Bluetooth. The main ingredients of a scatternet-based application include a topology formation and routing algorithm, which themselves are of many types. A standard architectural framework shall prove extremely useful to integrate all these applications and algorithms in a seamless, modular and re-usable fashion, hence saving one from re-inventing the wheel most of the time. In this paper, we present one such novel architectural framework that constitutes a highly portable and plug-n-play modules to deploy scatternet-based applications over Bluetooth. These constituent modules may be developed independently and be easily integrated at run-time. The algorithm modules may be built in an application-oriented fashion to deliver better performance to particular type of applications that may have specific requirements and constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt to propose a standard architecture to deploy applications over Bluetooth. We provide details of our proposed set of APIs and describe a multimedia application that we have built in complete accordance with our architecture."
383995,21212,8228,On the impact of scheduler settings on the performance of multi-threaded SIP servers,2015,"Multi-threading is a widely used program execution model, where each thread executes independently while sharing some of the process resources. Multi-threaded processes are used for a range of network application servers including web servers, mail servers and SIP proxy servers (SPS) for Voice over IP (VoIP). The process scheduler is a core part of any Operating System and the policy it uses may have a significant impact on the various applications executing on the system. In this work, we investigate the impact of the Linux scheduler on the performance of OpenSIPS, an open source SIP proxy server. The version of Linux used in our study uses a scheduling policy known as “Completely Fair Scheduler” (CFS), and the Linux kernel provides several parameters that may be used to tune the CFS policy. We have collected a large set of experimental data, in a methodical fashion, to characterize the performance of SPS as a function of the number of server threads and the call arrival rate under (1) default CFS setting and (2) with CFS parameters tuned for improved performance. By fine tuning the scheduler parameters, SPS performance is improved in all scenarios, in some cases significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that takes into account the scheduler parameters in improving the performance of the SPS. Our results indicate that network operators may increase server capacity without additional capital expenditures, by applying insightful configuration changes to scheduler policy."
2236465,21212,8228,Integrating WLANs & MANETs to the IPv6 based Internet,2003,"This paper presents a novel approach to integrate wireless local area network (WLANs) and mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) to the Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) based Internet. In the proposed network architecture, the mobiles, connected as a MANET, employ the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol for routing within the MANET. Gateways are used to connect MANETs to the Internet. This paper extends the functionality of OLSR to support mobile IP (MIP). This functionality is essential in a scenario where a node moving into an OLSR MANET needs to auto-configure its care-of-address and to propagate a binding update message containing its new care-of-address to its home agent and its correspondent node(s) located on the Internet. Automatic mode-detection and switching capability is also introduced in each mobile node to facilitate handoffs between WLANs and MANETs. Mobility management across WLANs and MANETs is achieved through mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). A real test-bed is constructed to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach. Results from a performance evaluation on this test-bed are presented. Efficiency of handoffs between WLANs and MANETs is measured in terms of delay and packet loss. The impact of OLSR based route discovery and packet propagation, and mobile IPv6 features such as movement detection and address auto-configuration on the handoff latency and packet loss are quantified. These performance benchmarks and metrics provide in assessment of the impact of the aforementioned system features on the QoS parameters associated with handoffs."
1975273,21212,8228,Maximal Lifetime Rate and Power Allocation for Sensor Networks with Data Distortion Constraints,2007,"We address a lifetime maximization problem for a single-hop wireless sensor network where multiple sensors encode and communicate their measurements of a Gaussian random source to a fusion centre (FC). The FC is required to reconstruct the source within a prescribed distortion threshold. The lifetime optimization problem is formulated as a joint power, rate and timeslot (for TDMA) allocation problem under the constraints of the well known rate distortion constraints for the Gaussian CEO problem, the capacity constraints of the wireless links, the energy constraints of the sensor nodes and the strict delay constraint within which the encoded sensor data must arrive at the FC. We study the performances of TDMA and an interference limited non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) (with single user decoding) based protocols and compare them against the upper bound provided by the optimal lifetime performance where the capacity constraints are given by the Gaussian multiaccess capacity region. While the constrained non-linear optimization problems for the TDMA and the Gaussian multiaccess cases are convex, the NOMA case results in a non-linear nonconvex D.C. (difference of convex functions) programming problem. We provide a simple successive convex approximation based algorithm for the NOMA case that converges fast to a suboptimal lifetime performance that compares favourably against the upper bound provided by the Gaussian multiaccess case. Extensive numerical studies are presented for both static and slow fading wireless environments with full channel state information at the fusion centre."
2848419,21212,8228,Downlink SLNR based precoding and power control in massive MIMO systems with time-shifted pilots,2016,"In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with time-shifted pilots, the interference from other cell groups, where the pilots are staggered with the ones in the target cell group, can be eliminated when the number of antennas at base station (BS) is infinite. However, with only hundreds of antennas at the BS in practice, both intra-group interference and inter-group interference can not be ignored. Aiming at this problem, a Signal to Leakage and Noise Ratio (SLNR) based downlink precoding and power control scheme is proposed in this paper. In the design of precoder, not only the interference leaked to the users within the same cell is considered, but also the interference leaked to the BSs which are receiving the uplink pilots is included by introducing a conversion factor. Furthermore, the channel estimation error (CEE) is modelled and considered to enhance the robustness of the precoder. To obtain the tradeoff between uplink channel estimation and downlink data transmission, the preferable transmission power and conversion factor are found by maximizing the asymptotic sum-rate, which is dependent on the large-scale fading coefficients and some constants. In the calculation of asymptotic sum-rate, the truncated polynomial expansion (TPE) method is used to simplify the precoder and further to decouple the sum-rate computation from the small-scale fading coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed downlink transmission scheme outperforms the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) based downlink scheme remarkably. Moreover, the performance obtained by asymptotic sum-rate optimization is very close to the complicated instantaneous sum-rate optimization."
2294416,21212,10228,QoS-based packet scheduling in wireless multimedia networks,2004,"Scheduling at packet level is one of the critical technologies in transporting multimedia traffic across wireless networks for providing quality of service (QoS) differentiation and guarantees. Also QoS support in wireless scheduling is dictated by the network architecture and service mode. Moreover, wireless communication poses special problems and difficulties that do not exist in wireline networks. This paper develops a self-organizing, multihop, mobile wireless network, which relies on a token passing access scheme for multimedia support. In the proposed network architecture, mobile nodes are grouped into clusters by QoS specifications and packet characteristics. The clusters are independently controlled, and are dynamically reconfigured as node move. Hence, the network is robust in the face of topological changes caused by node motion, node failure, and node insertion/removal. We model it as a discrete-time system with asymmetric exhaustive service policies by imbedding Markov chain, and apply qualitative and quantitative analysis to validate if the new strategy can provide service at a certain desired performance. Through simulations we show that this architecture provides an efficient, stable infrastructure for the integration of different types of traffic in a dynamic wireless networks. In addition, how the relative variable parameters effect on system characteristics is discussed and compared."
482682,21212,8228,60 GHz UWB rake receivers in a realistic scenario for wireless home entertainment,2015,"By providing reliable high-capacity wireless links, the 60 GHz mmWaves band is expected to revolutionize the future wireless multimedia and home entertainment usage model, which is an inseparable part of the 5G concept. Besides the efforts within the frameworks of established standards, such as 802.15.3.c and 802.11ad, there is still lack of experimental measurements and performance evaluations in those environments that closely correspond to the different envisaged realistic application scenarios. Also, the potential of different transmission technologies at this band, besides the OFDM and SC-FDE, which are defined by the above mentioned standards, is not largely investigated in the literature. In this paper, based on UWB experimental channel impulse responses recorded in a modern residential environment, we evaluate the performance of Rake receivers to achieve high data rates (HDRs) with reasonable SNR, but still low Rake's complexity, with the purpose of meeting the QoS requirements of the wireless home entertainment use case. The bit-error rate performance evaluation of both partial and selective Rakes is applied to QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM modulation schemes, defined in the existing standards. The promising results obtained in this study place the Rake receiver architecture as a valuable candidate for future 60 GHz WPANs and WLANs transceivers."
2402176,21212,8228,Flow Level Performance Analysis of Wireless Data Networks: A Case Study,2006,"We give an example of flow level performance analysis of data traffic in wireless networks by studying a scenario where two base stations with link adaptation serve in a coordinated fashion downloading users on a road or street between the stations. Due to the dynamic nature of such systems, a detailed flow level analysis is challenging and conventional methods run into computational difficulties. We motivate the detailed analysis by studying the system under different operational goals such as maximum throughput, max-min fairness and balanced fairness, concluding that the performance under these dynamic policies differ significantly from the performance under more tractable static policies. We discuss how the corresponding numerical analyses can be facilitated by applying the notion of balanced fairness and, in particular, introduce a novel approximation method referred to as value extrapolation. Value extrapolation can be applied to approximate any performance measure expressed as the expected value of a random variable which is a function of the system state. The idea of the value extrapolation is to consider the system in the MDP (Markov Decision Processes) setting and to solve the expected value from the Howard equations written for a truncated state space. Instead of a simple truncation, the relative values of states just outside the truncated state space are estimated using a polynomial extrapolation based on the states inside. This leads to a closed system and, unless the system is heavily loaded, allows one to obtain accurate results with remarkably small truncated state spaces."
1951620,21212,8228,PPPmux-a new protocol for transporting small IP packets,2001,"We introduce a new protocol to improve the capacity of communication links to carry real-time applications that generate a large number of small packets. The key issue in the transport of such applications is the relatively large protocol overhead for each packet. For example, the overhead for RTP/UDP/IP/PPP/HDLC is 12/8/20/7 bytes respectively resulting in a total of 47 bytes. This is considerable for applications with a small payload (10-20 bytes). RTP/UDP/IP header compression (cRTP) mitigates the problem partially by reducing the corresponding protocol overhead from 40 bytes to a best case of 2 bytes. PPPmux provides a further improvement by multiplexing multiple application-level packets into a single PPP frame thereby reducing the PPP overhead per packet. One potential deployment of PPPmux is in cellular networks (IS-95A and UMTS) on links connecting base stations to the radio access network controllers (RNC). The paper provides numerical results listing capacity improvements over existing schemes. Since, multiplexing concatenates multiple IP packets into a single PPP frame, a frame loss would result in loss of multiple IP packets. We provide guidelines on the choosing the optimal multiplexing size that gives the best trade-off between increase in link capacity and increase in packet loss. Specifically, the multiplexing size of 200 bytes gives the best compromise between capacity and packet loss for typical cellular applications."
1832775,21212,8228,Dynamic Lightpath Allocation in Translucent WDM Optical Networks,2009,"The optical reach (the distance an optical signal can travel before the signal quality degrades to a level that necessitates regeneration) ranges from 500 to 2000 miles. To establish a lightpath of length greater than the optical reach, it is necessary to regenerate optical signals. In a translucent optical network, there are regeneration points, where the signal undergoes Optical-Electronic-Optical (O-E-O) conversion. In this paper we have proposed routing algorithms for translucent networks in a dynamic lightpath allocation environment in which requests for communication arrive continuously. In response to each request for communication, the objective is to establish, if possible, a path, from the source to the destination of the request for communication, so that a lightpath may be established, using the path that requires the fewest stages of regeneration. In practical transparent networks, a lightpath must satisfy the wavelength continuity constraint. However, in a translucent network, this constraint can be relaxed at the regeneration points. We have proposed an Integer Linear Program, to give the optimum results for small networks, as well as an efficient heuristic for this problem that works for larger networks. We have evaluated the heuristic through extensive simulations to establish that the heuristic produces close-to-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time needed for the optimal solutions. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the relative impact of a set of network resources, such as (i) the number of regenerators, (ii) the optical reach of the regenerators and (iii) the number of wavelengths, on the network performance, measured in terms of the call blocking probability. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that undertakes such an evaluation for translucent networks."
1350309,21212,8228,A self-configurable power control algorithm for cognitive radio-based industrial wireless sensor networks with interference constraints,2012,"With the growth of different design goals and application requirements, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are receiving sustained attentions in the recent low-cost industrial automation systems. Moreover, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology gives us a possibility to maximize the utilization efficiency of the limited spectrum resources. However, because the wireless devices coexist in the same radio environment, there are harmful channel conflicts among users, and the increasing radio systems causes great contribution to the increasing energy consumption. In order to realize the industrial circumstance, we complete three major works in this paper. First of all, we describe a practical model of cumulative interferences from the entire cognitive radio-based industrial wireless sensor networks (CR-IWSNs). Then, based on the interference model and the interference avoidance purpose, we propose a self-configurable power control scheme to address the communication requirements on both interference temperature and secondary network Quality-of-Service. Finally, Nonlinear Programming is used to model the scheme and a distributed algorithm is given to solve the problem. Several simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed power control algorithm on optimizing the total system throughput and energy consumption. Results show that the throughput could be improved and the energy consumption could be reduced with the guarantee that the users are without interference."
1184383,21212,8228,Energy optimization in optical grids through anycasting,2013,"Optical grids are emerging as a natural, cost-effective platform to meet the needs for powerful computing, large storage capacity and high-speed data transmission capabilities in a number of important application areas. In spite of the lower power cost per bit of optical networks, it is expected that one of the most challenging issues in the next decade will be reducing the power requirement for such core networks. Much of the recent work on optical grid network design has focused on optimizing the use of traditional computing and network resources in an integrated manner. In grid systems, it is typically possible to select one out of a number of possible destinations to execute a specific job. This is known as anycasting, and in this paper we propose a new approach for energy minimization in optical grids that exploits the inherent flexibility of anycasting. We present a comprehensive integer linear program (ILP) formulation that selects the destination node and performs routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) to minimize the overall energy consumption of a set of static lightpath demands. We also present a 2-stage ILP that can quickly generate solutions for large networks. Simulation results indicate that significant energy savings can be achieved by the proposed approach, not only compared to traditional RWA techniques but also over energy-aware unicast methods."
1771229,21212,22035,Waiting times in quality of experience for web based services,2012,"A considerable share of applications such as web or e-mail browsing, online picture viewing and file downloads imply waiting times for their users, which is due to the turn-taking of information requests by the user and correspoding response times until each request is fulfilled. Thus, end-user quality perception in the context of interactive data services is dominated by waiting times; the longer the latter, the less satisfied the user becomes. As opposed to heavily researched multimedia experience, perception of waiting times is still not strongly explored in the context of Quality of Experience (QoE). This tutorial will contribute to closing this gap. In its first part, it addresses perception principles and discusses their applicability towards fundamental relationships between waiting times and resulting QoE. It then investigates to which extent the same relationships can also be used to describe QoE for more complex services such as web browsing. Finally, it discusses applications where waiting times determine QoE, amongst other factors. For example, the past shift from UDP media streaming to TCP media streaming (e.g. youtube.com) has extended the relevance of waiting times also to the domain of online video services. In particular, user-perceived quality suffers from initial delays when applications are launched, as well as from freezes during the delivery of the stream. These aspects, which have to be traded against each other to some extent, will be discussed mainly for HTTP video streaming in the last part of this tutorial."
633313,21212,8228,Inter-domain router placement and traffic engineering,2002,"The Internet is organized as an interconnection of separate administrative domains called autonomous systems (ASs). The border gateway protocol (BGP) is the de facto standard for controlling the routing of traffic across different ASs. It supports scalable distribution of reachability and routing policy information among different ASs. In this paper, we study a network design problem which determines (1) the optimal placement of border router(s) within a domain and (2) the corresponding inter- and intra-domain traffic patterns within an AS. Practical constraints imposed by BGP and other standard shortest-path-based intra-domain routing protocols are considered. The problem is formulated as a variant of the uncapacitated network design problem (UNDP). While it is feasible to use a brute-force, integer-programming-based approach for tackling small instances of this problem, we have resorted to a dual-ascent approximation approach for mid/large-scale instances. The quality of the approximation approach is evaluated in terms of its computational efficiency and network cost sub-optimality. Sensitivity analysis w.r.t. various network/traffic parameters are also conducted. We then describe how one can apply our optimization results to better configure BGP as well as other intra-domain routing protocols. This serves as a first-step towards the auto-configuration of Internet routing protocols, BGP in particular, which is well-known for its tedious and error-prone configuration needs."
912363,21212,8228,Delay-sensitive power management for packet switches,2013,"Power management has become a critical issue for communication and computing infrastructures. In this paper, we develop systematic and heuristic algorithms for managing communication switches with multiple speed (throughput) modes. Switch speed is increased by activating additional network processor cores, voltage/frequency scaling of the electronics, etc. Higher speed modes burn more power. The developed power (speed) control algorithms are responsive to switch queue backlogs and aim to efficiently trade backlog vs. power costs, so as to minimize the long-run overall backlog and power cost. We first systematically model the system in a Dynamic Programming (DP) framework, where the optimal control can be computed in principle. Unfortunately, the complexity is so high that even for a 2 × 2 switch the computation time is practically infeasible. We therefore develop an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm based on the Q-learning framework, which has good computation and performance properties. We also develop two low-complexity heuristic power controls, one based on a “myopic” view of the control problem, and the other on “congestion-awareness” of the standard maximum weight matching scheme. We study the performance of the Q-learning and heuristic controls against the optimal one (which we can practically compute only for the 2×2 switch case), and coPmment on their efficiency. We also extend the method and results to the general case of multiprocessor computing resources."
824538,21212,8228,Achievable rates and power allocation for two-way AF relaying over Rayleigh fading channels,2013,"In this paper, achievable rates and power allocation (PA) schemes are studied for a two-way (TW) amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system over Rayleigh fading channels in high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. We consider three different AF techniques: i) the channel inversion (CI) scheme where the relay has full channel side information (CSI) of the two incoming links; ii) the fixed-gain scheme where the relay has only channel distribution information (CDI); and iii) a mixed (MX) scheme where the relay has CSI of one link but only CDI of the other. First, focusing on high SNR regimes, approximations to the achievable rates of the three systems are derived. The approximations are shown to be tight and can be used to analyze the systems under consideration. In particular, it is demonstrated that the CI system provides the best sum rate performance, followed by the MX and CDI techniques. A suboptimal yet effective PA scheme to maximize the sum rate at high SNR is then proposed. In low SNR regimes, we first derive rate approximations for the considered AF systems. It is then shown that the three systems achieve a similar sum rate. An asymptotically optimal PA is then proposed to maximize the sum rate at low SNRs. Finally, the sum rate of the direct transmission (DT) scheme is compared to that of the TWAF system. Although the TWAF is proved to be inferior at low SNRs, it outperforms the DT at high SNRs in various network configurations."
2226177,21212,20649,A fully programmable memory management system optimizing queue handling at multi gigabit rates,2003,"Two of the main bottlenecks when designing a network embedded system are very often the memory bandwidth and its capacity. This is mainly due to the extremely high speed of the state-of-the-art network links and to the fact that in order to support advanced quality of service (QoS), per-flow queuing is desirable. In this paper we describe the architecture of a memory manager that can provide up to 10Gbs of aggregate throughput while handling 512K queues. The presented system supports a complete instruction set and thus we believe it can be used as a hardware component in any suitable embedded system, particularly network SoCs that implement per flow queuing. When designing this scheme several optimization techniques have been evaluated and the most cost and performance effective ones used. These techniques minimize both the memory bandwidth and the memory capacity needed, which is considered a main advantage of the proposed scheme. The proposed architecture uses a simple DRAM for data storage and a typical SRAM for keeping data structures-pointers, therefore minimizing the system's cost. The device has been fabricated within a novel programmable network processor designed for efficient protocol processing in high speed networking applications. It consists of 155K gates and occupies 5.23 mm/sup 2/ in UMC 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS."
1714364,21212,23712,Adaptive Optimization of Rate Adaptation Algorithms in Multi-Rate WLANs,2007,"Rate adaptation is one of the basic functionalities in today's 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs). Although it is primarily designed to cope with the variability of wireless channels and achieve higher system spectral efficiency, its design needs careful consideration of cross-layer dependencies, in particular, link-layer collisions. Most practical rate adaptations focus on the time-varying characteristics of wireless channels, ignoring the impact of link-layer collisions. As a result, they may lose their effectiveness due to unnecessary rate downshift wrongly triggered by the collisions. Some recently proposed rate adaptations use RTS/CTS to suppress the collision effect by differentiating collisions from channel errors. The RTS/CTS handshake, however, incurs significant overhead and is rarely activated in infrastructure WLANs. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimizing the operation of rate adaptations by adjusting the rate-increasing and decreasing parameters based on link-layer measurement. To construct the algorithm, we study the impact of rate-increasing and decreasing thresholds on performance and show that dynamic adjustment of thresholds is an effective way to mitigate the collision effect in multi-user environments. Our method does not require additional probing overhead incurred by RTS/CTS exchanges and may be practically deployed without change in firmware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution, comparing with existing approaches through extensive simulations."
696508,21212,8228,Dynamic service placement for mobile micro-clouds with predicted future costs,2015,"Seamless computing and data access is enabled by the emerging technology of mobile micro-clouds (MMCs). Different from traditional centralized clouds, an MMC is typically connected directly to a wireless base-station and provides services to a small group of users, which allows users to have instantaneous access to cloud services. Due to the limited coverage area of base-stations and the dynamic nature of mobile users, network background traffic, etc., the question of where to place the services to cope with these dynamics arises. In this paper, we focus on dynamic service placement for MMCs. We consider the case where there is an underlying mechanism to predict the future costs of service hosting and migration, and the prediction error is assumed to be bounded. Our goal is to find the optimal service placement sequence which minimizes the average cost over a given time. To solve this problem, we first propose a method which solves for the optimal placement sequence for a specific look-ahead time-window, based on the predicted costs in this time-window. We show that this problem is equivalent to a shortest-path problem and propose an algorithm with polynomial time-complexity to find its solution. Then, we propose a method to find the optimal look-ahead window size, which minimizes an upper bound of the average cost. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by simulations with realworld user-mobility traces."
322884,21212,8228,Coexistence of pico- and femto-cellular LTE-unlicensed with legacy indoor Wi-Fi deployments,2015,"Due to the high expected increase in mobile data traffic and the scarcity of licensed spectrum for cellular networks, 3GPP has started preliminary work for standardizing LTE operation in the 5 GHz unlicensed band (LTE-U). However, LTE-U would interfere with other legacy technologies operating in the unlicensed band, the most important being contention-based Wi-Fi, which would be blocked by conventional LTE, which is designed for dedicated licensed spectrum. Consequently, some coexistence-enabling mechanisms have been proposed for LTE-U, but their evaluation is still at an early stage. In this paper we present a detailed system-level study on the downlink throughput performance of legacy indoor IEEE 802.11n and LTE-U deployments coexisting in the 5 GHz band. We consider several LTE-U coexistence mechanisms (i.e. listen-before-talk and interference-aware channel selection) in indoor LTE-U femtocell and outdoor LTE-U picocell scenarios with a realistic range of network densities and real outdoor picocell locations. We also study coexistence of LTE-U networks deployed by multiple operators, and evaluate the impact of different LTE-U transmit power levels. Our results show that in general both Wi-Fi and LTE-U benefit from the large number of available channels and isolation provided by building shielding at 5 GHz. Additionally, in typical indoor coexistence scenarios, interference-aware channel selection is more efficient for both Wi-Fi and LTE-U than listen-before-talk mechanisms. For outdoor LTE-U picocells and indoor Wi-Fi deployments, the two networks are isolated from each other, but listen-before-talk can increase LTE-U user throughput when multiple outdoor LTE-U networks deployed by different cellular operators coexist."
2075480,21212,8228,Understanding Cross-Layer Effects on Quality of Experience for Video over NGMN,2011,"The evolution of wireless network standards, e.g., GSM/GPRS, UMTS, WiFi, WiMAX, and end-user devices has paved the way towards Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN), where users are always connected through multiple radio access networks. NGMN technologies target to improve the user experience especially for mobile data and multimedia services, which are in line with user expectations evident from, for instance, the increasingly popular mobile HTTP video streaming. To understand the quality that can be offered to the user in NGMNs, we compare the Quality of Experience (QoE) for HTTP streaming in a prototype NGMN testbed with WiFi and 3G UMTS/HSDPA support. We use CUBIC TCP as the transport layer protocol as it is typically the default TCP variant, e.g., in Android phones. We complement the QoE estimations with network QoS parameters such as throughput and delay, and transport layer statistics. The results of our evaluation show that (i) video QoE remains stable in WiFi even for high packet losses compared to UMTS, (ii) QoE in UMTS is sensitive to packet loss even for low loss rates due to high variations in the network QoS, namely, throughput and delay, (iii) the decrease in QoE and QoS in HSDPA is due to its negative interactions with the aggressive congestion control of CUBIC TCP, and (iv) handover from WiFi to HSDPA degrades QoE."
2377119,21212,8228,Power management for throughput enhancement in wireless ad-hoc networks,2000,"We introduce the notion of power management within the context of wireless ad-hoc networks. More specifically, we investigate the effects of using different transmit powers on the average power consumption and end-to-end network throughput in a wireless ad-hoc environment. This power management approach would help in reducing the system power consumption and hence prolonging the battery life of mobile nodes. Furthermore, it improves the end-to-end network throughput as compared to other ad-hoc networks in which all mobile nodes use the same transmit power. The improvement is due to the achievement of a tradeoff between minimizing interference ranges, reduction in the average number of hops to reach a destination, reducing the probability of having isolated clusters, and reducing the average number of transmissions (including retransmissions due to collisions). The protocols would first dynamically determine an optimal connectivity range wherein they adapt their transmit powers so as to only reach a subset of the nodes in the network. The connectivity range would then be dynamically changed in a distributed manner so as to achieve the near optimal throughput. Minimal power routing is used to further enhance performance. Simulation studies are carried out in order to investigate these design approaches. It is seen a network with such a power managed scheme would achieve a better end-to-end throughput performance (about 10% improvement with a slotted aloha MAC protocol) and lower transmit power (about an 80% Improvement) than a network without such a scheme."
788951,21212,8228,Direct decoding of uplink space-time block coded multicarrier code division multiple access systems,2004,"The uplink of a space-time block coded multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) system endowed with a uniform linear array (ULA) at the base station of macrocell is studied. Transmission takes place over frequency-selective fading channels and the transmitted symbol of a user is encoded by Tarokh's rate 1 space-time block encoder, (V. Tarokh and H. Jafarkhani, July 1999) from real orthogonal design, with three transmit antennas. An algorithm is proposed to blindly estimate the data symbol sequence and the direction of arrival (DOA) of each user without determining the space-time vector channels. The algorithm employs an ESPRIT- like method (Y. Zeng et al.) to separate multiple co-channel users with different impinging DOAs, then exploits the structure of space- time block coding (STBC) in combination with the subspace method to estimate the original symbol sequences for multiple users. In particular, the theoretical analysis shows that the signal subspace defined by the received data covariance matrix can be separated by users' DOA, so the joint diagonalization step of many matrices due to the method presented by A. Swindlehurst (April 2002) is avoided, which saves large computations. Computer simulations illustrate the overall performances of the proposed algorithm."
1555638,21212,8228,An algorithm for joint guidance and power control for electric vehicles in the smart grid,2012,"A massive amount of energy consumption currently stems from the transportation sector. Therefore, improvements in power usage by commuting vehicles are being studied and becoming an increasingly popular research topic. In particular, there is a growing need to model the envisioned smart infrastructure, including charging stations, some of which might include energy storage devices and swappable, pre-charged batteries. For such new stations, power management is indeed crucial for operation costs, driver convenience, and overall smart grid efficiency. Information technology, communications and vehicle intelligence need to play a crucial role in this process. In this paper, we describe a quantitative model and propose a guiding and control system for the charging of PHEVs in a future smart infrastructure. Specifically, we describe an algorithm that can be used for the joint guidance and power control of smarter electric vehicles in the smart grid. We envision it as part of a larger Smart Guide for the Smart Grid (SGSG) system. Its function is to guide PHEV drivers, directing them to the appropriate charging station, while attempting to achieve an optimization goal at the same time. Our algorithm aims at a joint guiding and power control, in order to heuristically maximize the weighted sum of the average of throughput and energy cost consumption from multiple vehicle charging stations, while satisfying a cost constraint at each station, as well as system stability."
1772708,21212,8228,Average-Bandwidth Delay Q-Routing Adaptive Algorithm,2008,"In the last decade, due to emerging real-time and multimedia applications, there has been much interest for developing mechanisms to take into account the quality of service required by these applications. One of these mechanisms consists to integrate simultaneously many criteria of quality of service (QoS) in routing decision. Efficient routing of information packets in dynamically changing communication network requires that as the load levels, traffic patterns and topology of the network change, the routing policy also adapts. We propose in this paper an approach used an adaptive algorithm for packet routing using reinforcement learning called AV-BW Delay Q- Routing. This approach is based on earlier developed K-Optimal path Q-Routing Algorithm (KOQRA) which optimizes simultaneously two additive QoS criteria: cumulative cost path and end-to-end delay. The approach developed here adds a third criterion to KOQRA regarding residual bandwidth. This proposed technique uses an inductive approach based on trial/error paradigm combined with swarm adaptive approaches. The whole algorithm uses a model combining both a stochastic planned pre-navigation for the exploration phase and a deterministic approach for the backward phase. Numerical results obtained with OPNET simulator for different levels of traffic's load show that AV-BW Delay Q-Routing improves clearly performances of our earlier KOQRA."
559520,21212,8228,Intra-slot Interference Cancellation for collision resolution in Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA,2015,"ALOHA-type protocols became a popular solution for distributed and uncoordinated multiple random access in wireless networks. However, such distributed operation of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer leads to sub-optimal utilization of the shared channel. One of the reasons is the occurrence of collisions when more than one packet is transmitted at the same time. These packets cannot be decoded and retransmissions are necessary. However, it has been recently shown that it is possible to apply signal processing techniques with these collided packets so that useful information can be decoded. This was recently proposed in the Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA), achieving a throughput T ≃ 0.97 for very large MAC frame lengths as long as the number of active users is smaller than the number of slots per frame. In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an iterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect and ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the slot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per slot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as Extended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity. Computer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the maximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of active users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show that E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC frame lengths used in practical scenarios."

In particular, in this paper, the WSN4QoL's system architecture is presented as designed to exploit the Network Coding (NC) mechanisms to achieve energy efficiency in the wireless communications and distributed positioning solutions to locate patients in indoor home environments. The system has been validated through experimental activities using commercial off the shelf (COTS) WSN testbeds and medical devices prototypes offered by a commercial partner. Results demonstrate that NC helps in achieving substantial gains in terms of energy efficiency as compared to traditional relay mechanisms, while the proposed positioning solution is able to locate people in indoor environments at a sub-room accuracy level, without requiring any extra dedicated hardware."
2520037,21212,8228,Throughput and Delay Analysis of Multihop IEEE 802.11 Networks with Capture,2007,"In this paper, we present an analytical model for the approximate calculation of the throughput and end-to-end delay performance in single hop and multihop IEEE 802.11 networks under uniform traffic distribution while accounting for the effect of aggregate interference and capture. We do this using a major interferer approximation approach where we approximate the aggregate interference by the interference caused by the closest interferer only. We then calculate the network throughput rate by modeling the CSMA/CA MAC channel state process as a regenerative stochastic process. To compute the distribution of the incurred packet end-to-end delay, we use the regenerative process modeling approach to calculate the moments of the effective packet service time; we then apply the latter through the use of an M/G/1 queuing system model to calculate the average and standard-deviation of the packet's waiting time in each node's queue The effect of capture is taken into account in calculating the probability of successful reception by accounting for the effect of the aggregate interference detected at the corresponding receivers. We also introduce an analytical approach for calculating an approximation to the throughput and packet delay performance in multihop networks. The network's throughput level is calculated in terms of the underlying values for the network's spatial reuse factor and average path length. Consequently, we model the multihop network as a congregation of smaller, single hop subnetworks, which allows us to derive an effective method for the approximate mathematical evaluation of the network throughput rate and end-to-end packet delay performance."
2082032,21212,8228,A QoS framework for stabilized collision channels with multiuser detection,2005,"Recent work has shown that cross-layer optimization of the physical layer and medium access control for a wireless collision channel, based on a receiver with adaptive multiuser detection capability, is capable of providing significantly better performance than classical Aloha. The basic features of such a system are multipacket reception (MPR) capability, and the ability (with high probability) to estimate the number of contending users even when the packets are not successfully received. We provide an analytical model that includes these features, and use it to derive methods for backlog estimation and stabilization. Two classes of users are considered: high priority users with quality of service (QoS) requirements, who must succeed within a deadline with a specified probability; and low priority users whose throughput we wish to maximize, while maintaining the QoS for high priority users, and keeping the overall system stable. We obtain contention policies that ensure QoS and stability, based on backlog estimates obtained by extending Rivest's pseudo-Bayesian technique for classical Aloha. The channel throughput and the achievable QoS is characterized as a function of the arrival rates for high and low priority users. Finally, we apply these methods to simulations of a system employing differential minimum mean squared error (DMMSE) adaptive multiuser detection, and find that the analytical model provides accurate guidelines for design and performance predictions."
2112765,21212,8228,An innovative low-cost Classification Scheme for combined multi-Gigabit IP and Ethernet Networks,2006,"IP is certainly the most popular wide area network protocol while Ethernet is the most common Layer-2 network protocol, and it is currently being deployed beyond the tight borders of LANs. In order to accommodate the needs of MANs and WANs, several QoS mechanisms employed either at the IP layer or the MAC sublayer have been proposed. These QoS mechanisms require identification of network flows and the classification of network packets according to certain packet header fields. In this paper, we propose a classification engine employed either at the MAC sublayer or the IP layer, which is the successor of a scheme already successfuly implemented which is only employed at the MAC sublayer. This new scheme uses an innovative hashing scheme combined with an efficient trie-based structure. By using such techniques, the extremely high speed decisions ?at a rate of more than 100Gb/sec- are supported, while the memory needs of the proposed engine are significantly lower compared to those of the similar schemes currently used. This engine has been implemented in hardware utilizing less than 0.2mm2 in a state of the art CMOS technology. As a result the proposed scheme is a very promising candidate for both the next-generation IP classification engines(probably incorporated within the high-end network processors) as well as for the Ethernet equipments that need to support classification at multi-Gigabit per second network speeds, while also employing the minimum amount of memory."
2015267,21212,8228,"Poor, Good Enough or Even Better? Bridging the Gap between Acceptability and QoE of Mobile Broadband Data Services",2011,"Due to the accelerating uptake of mobile broadband services, Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment and optimization for wireless networks has become a topic of vital importance. In this field, subjective quality evaluation methods based on MOS (Mean Opinion Score) are the most widely used approaches for understanding and measuring perceived performance. However, while these methods have been proven to reliably quantify users' degrees of satisfaction, they do not sufficiently address the following important question: Which quality levels are acceptable to end users and which ones not?. In this paper we investigate the application of acceptability to the domain of QoE assessment for data services. To this end, we perform a critical review of the term's utilization and operationalization in related fields and discuss the results of a series of mobile broadband QoE studies we performed in lab and field settings. Our results demonstrate that acceptability is a relevant and useful concept that also features a consistent mapping between subjects' binary acceptance and ordinal satisfaction ratings, even across application scenarios as different as web browsing and file downloads. However, it is also a highly context-dependent concept since users' rating behaviors and thresholds diverge between lab and field settings. Acceptability thus needs to be evaluated in situ in the field in order to guarantee generalizable, ecologically valid results."
501195,21212,8228,Low-latency synchronization for OFDM-based visible light communication,2015,"5G wireless systems are envisioned to provide ultra-high data rates, increased robustness and low latency for new applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) and car-to-car (C2C) communications. This paper considers high-speed visible light communication (VLC) as a candidate serving technology to fulfill this set of requirements. Synchronization as the first step towards reliable data detection is studied here thoroughly aiming at high robustness and low complexity. Three schemes are reviewed, namely Schmidl-Cox and Park autocorrelation as well as a cross-correlation based approach, all using a predefined preamble. All schemes are examined concerning their robustness against multipath propagation and their precision in time estimation versus the preamble length. It is found that the simple Schmidl-Cox scheme, originally designed for complex-valued radio waveforms, can be applied also for real-valued optical wireless waveforms. Based on these investigations, an optimized preamble structure is finally proposed. Preamble boosting and fine synchronization can also be applied to reach a similar performance like optimal cross-correlation at reduced complexity. We study the fundamental trade-off between the preamble duration and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for reliable synchronization and observe that ultra-low latency needs sufficient SNR."
2678682,21212,8228,Cognitive radio enabled reliable transmission for optimal remote state estimation in multi-sensor industrial cyber-physical systems,2015,"This paper investigates the remote state estimation for the multi-sensor industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) with the help of cognitive radio (CR) technology. The remote state estimator estimates the system states based on the measurements received from multi-sensor via the unreliable communication media, therefore, the performance of remote state estimation is up to the transmission reliability. In this paper, the redundant transmission is adopted to improve the reliability. Furthermore, the CR technology, which can intelligently discover the available spectrum opportunities in licensed bands, is exploited to alleviate the spectrum over-crowd problem aggravated by the redundancy design to improve the state estimation performance by. Specifically, we firstly formulate two CR enabled sequential optimization problems to improve the accuracy of state estimation and enhance the understanding of industrial plant. The primary one is to minimize the CR enabled estimation error subjected to the limited resource. The secondary one is to maximize the CR enabled best-effort data transmission volume subjected to the primary one's solutions. Secondly, a new sequence is constructed to approximate the limit-form objective function of the primary optimization problem. Finally, the two optimization problems are transformed into convex programming with the Lagrangian relaxation and Lagrangian dual decomposition techniques to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the CR technology reduces the mean square error of state estimation by about 40% and increases the volume of the best-effort data transmission by about 320%."
2428055,21212,8228,On the Performance of CSI-Assisted Cooperative Communications over Generalized Fading Channels,2008,"Virtual antenna array (VAA) systems (also known as cooperative communications, cooperative diversity, cooperative relaying or antenna sharing systems) are a new and recently proposed kind of (cooperative) spatial diversity, which have been receiving a significant interest in various communities as a means for improving the performance of both infrastructure-based and ad-hoc-based transmission systems operating over multipath fading channels. In particular, in antenna sharing systems the mobile radios share their single-antennas to create a distributed virtual antenna array through distributed transmissions and distributed signal processing operations. Although cooperative wireless communications exhibit various design challenges and research opportunities at different protocol layers, in this contribution we mainly focus on physical layer issues. In particular, we propose a comprehensive and unified framework for performance analysis of multi-hop multi-branch wireless systems with channel state information (CSI-) assisted analog relays over generalized fading channels. The framework relies on the moment generating function (MGF-) approach for performance analysis of digital communication systems over fading channels and on some properties of the Laplace transform, which allow to develop a simple single-integral relation between the MGF of a random variable and the MGF of its inverse. Numerical and simulation results are also provided to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed framework."

The new Human Centric Intelligent Society results from these changes is connecting information from many different sources across the physical and virtual worlds, using the power of integration to achieve new insights and to enact change in ways which are quicker and more context aware than ever before. The Human Centric integration will lead to safer, more comfortable and more prosperous societies, but before arriving to this status, we have several challenges for the existing platforms to be migrated and digitalized into a common Cloud Computing ecosystem, and enable the common things with a Web of Things capabilities that can enable new forms of social infrastructure that react to the needs of people in real time. In this work, we present the contributions and extensions to the EENA Public Safety Answering Points standards and data structure (PIDFLO), in order to enable it with the capabilities to be integrated with data coming from personal and wearable sensors (Internet of Things). In details, we have extended PIDF-LO with the support of OMA LwM2M Web Objects, in order to offer a scalable and interoperable integration of the Internet of Things and the European Emergencies Services based on Open Standards."
3048181,21212,369,Channel Characteristics Analysis of Angle and Clustering in Indoor Office Environment at 28 GHz,2016,"The millimeter-wave band will be one of the most key components in the next generation wireless communication system. In this paper, a radio channel measurement was conducted in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth. The channel sounder with the clock synchronization was used to measure in both line-of-sight (LoS) and none- line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are recorded with an omnidirectional antenna at TX and a horizontal-rotating horn antenna fixed at the same height at RX as references. The space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm was applied to extract the channel characteristics of multipath components (MPCs) from the synthesized CIRs, and then the direct synthesized CIRs and the CIRs constructed from SAGE results were compared in terms of power delay profiles (PDPs) and power angular spread (PAS). It is found that the reconstructed results closely approximate real results. In addition, the cluster numbers and the inner-cluster root mean square (RMS) angle spreads are drawn after the clustering analysis and they cohere with the changes of the corresponding surrounding environment of the point, regardless of LoS or NLoS. The wireless channel propagation at 28 GHz is heavily dependent on the environment because the linear and reflective propagation are the main mode of transmission."
1691663,21212,8228,Resilient network dimensioning for optical grid/clouds using relocation,2012,"In this paper we address the problem of dimensioning infrastructure, comprising both network and server resources, for large-scale decentralized distributed systems such as grids or clouds. We will provide an overview of our work in this area, and in particular focus on how to design the resulting grid/cloud to be resilient against network link and/or server site failures. To this end, we will exploit relocation: under failure conditions, a request may be sent to an alternate destination than the one under failure-free conditions. We will provide a comprehensive overview of related work in this area, and focus in some detail on our own most recent work. The latter comprises a case study where traffic has a known origin, but we assume a degree of freedom as to where its end up being processed, which is typically the case for e.g., grid applications of the bag-of-tasks (BoT) type or for providing cloud services. In particular, we will provide in this paper a new integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to solve the resilient grid/cloud dimensioning problem using failure-dependent backup routes. Our algorithm will simultaneously decide on server and network capacity. We find that in the anycast routing problem we address, the benefit of using failure-dependent (FD) rerouting is limited compared to failure-independent (FID) backup routing. We confirm our earlier findings in terms of network capacity savings achieved by relocation compared to not exploiting relocation (order of 6–10% in the current case studies)."
2889820,21212,8228,Joint network optimization in cooperative transmission networks with imperfect CSI,2016,"This paper investigates the power efficiency in downlink cooperative networks under spherical channel uncertainties, using a worst-case robust formulation. The aim of this paper is to jointly optimize the base station (BS) operation mode, mobile user (MU) association, and beamformings to achieve the robust network power gain. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer non-convex problem with infinite number signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and maximum transmit power constraints, which is nontrivial to solve even without this constraint. By firstly translating the uncertainty in CSI to the uncertainty in its covariance matrix, the SINR constraint spans a convex set using the Lagrangian based method. Due to the coupled integer variables, the complexity of exhaustive search grows exponentially with network size, motivating to develop low-complexity heuristic algorithms. We propose to solve the problem via a novel two-layer (TL) algorithm: inner and outer layer, successively. Specifically, the BS operation mode is determined successively in the outer layer using a Rank based Successive Search (RSS) method, while in the inner layer, an iterative Difference of Convex (DC) based algorithm is proposed to determine the MU association. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the total power consumption over existing alternatives."
381912,21212,8228,Full-standard broadcast DVB-T and wireless overlay on legacy and OFDM next-generation FTTH networks,2015,"This paper presents the performance evaluation of full-standard wireless signals overlay on two access networks: (i) legacy long-reach networks and (ii) next-generation networks using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The proposed bundle of full-standard OFDM wireless signals includes broadcast of ETSI EN 300 744 DVB-T signals and multi-format wireless signals 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE), IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and ECMA-368 ultra-wide band (UWB). This bundle of OFDM-based signals is transmitted using radio-over-fibre in overlay with: (i) legacy baseband data of a conventional passive optical network (PON) or (ii) a custom OFDM signal providing Gigabit Ethernet (OFDM-GbE) for next-generation access networks. The optimum RF input power level for the combined bundle of signals is evaluated for both downstream (using external transmission) and upstream (using direct modulation). The successful demodulation of all signals confirms the actual possibility of coexistence of multi-format OFDM wireless with legacy baseband data. Also, it is demonstrated that the system with OFDM-GbE can achieve longer optical reach using centralized OFDM compensation. In this case, the possibility of providing video overlay with more DVB-T channels is confirmed for the complete UHF band."
2541177,21212,8228,Quality of Service in Wireless Network Diversity Multiple Access Protocols Based on a Virtual Time-Slot Allocation,2007,"In this paper, we propose a new resource allocation mechanism which is designed to improve the multiuser detection of wireless network diversity multiple access (NDMA) protocols. The mechanism consists of allocating an average number of time- slots to the active user population according to a prescribed quality of service requirement. It is dubbed virtual because it does not rely on user scheduling over different time-slots, but instead it is controlled by adjusting the probability of false alarm of each user. The allocation mechanism improves the throughput of conventional NDMA protocols at the expense of both an access delay degradation and an increased system complexity. The system requires to recover the signals from a mixing system with more outputs (the collected network transmissions) than inputs (the collided packets). By setting the average allocated time-slots to remain constant over different traffic loads, both the optimum transmission probabilities and the stability region of the protocol are approximated by relevant closed-form expressions. Also, the proposed analytical formulation extends the expressions of conventional NDMA systems to the asymmetrical user case (i.e. users with different data rates and detection statistics). Finally, it is shown that under extreme traffic loads, multiuser detection conditions and quality of service requirements, the proposed system degrades into the equivalent of the traditional networking protocols TDMA (time division multiple access) and Slotted- ALOHA (S-ALOHA)."
1910769,21212,8228,Analysis on the central-stage buffered Clos-network for packet switching,2005,"Our work is motivated by the desire to build a scalable packet switch with extremely large number of ports. We consider building a multi-stage packet switch from many mid-size packet switches with distributed memories in the central stage. This new architecture resembles the famous Clos-network used in circuit switching systems except that it has buffers in the central stage. We call it Central-stage buffered Clos-network (CBC). In particular, we denote the symmetric Clos-network as (n, m, k) which means k input modules with n input ports each and m central modules. Each module is a non-blocking switch. Ideally, this CBC architecture would have similar benefits as those of an output-queued switch, i.e., the delay of individual packets could be precisely controlled, allowing the provision of guaranteed qualities of service. The main result of this paper is that, if m is approximately 4 times that of n, it is theoretically possible for a CBC to emulate an FCFS output-queued packet switch with all components running at the line rate, i.e., with no speedup. Particularly, we need to double the traditional strictly non-blocking Clos-network in the number of central modules. We show that the need to double the central modules is due to resolving the input port conflicts. But it is still much more cost effective compared with scaling one stage switches which usually have a complexity proportional to the square of the number of ports. If we slightly modify the CBC structure, we can further show that CBC can emulate any QoS queuing discipline if m is approximately 4 times of n. But packets may experience some delay which is bounded within a constant time."
2867822,21212,8228,Robust chance-constrained distributed beamforming for multicell interference networks,2016,"We propose a robust coordinated game theoretic approach that distributively minimizes the aggregate downlink transmit power in a multicell interference network in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The optimization is constrained to satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirements at individual user terminals within certain predefined SINR outage probabilities. This problem is numerically intractable due to the cross-link coupling effect among a cluster of base stations (BSs) as well as the robust constraints that involve the second order statistical CSI estimation error. By employing cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution, Lemma 2 and semidefinite relaxation technique, we first convert the original problem to a linear matrix inequality form. Then, we introduce an iterative subgradient algorithm that decomposes the multicell-wise general problem into a set of parallel subproblems at individual BSs to find the global optimality. We show that the proposed design co-ordinates intercell interference among the BSs with a light inter-BS communication overhead. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed chance-constrained distributed design in terms of power efficiency and achievable robustness trade-off."
251685,21212,8228,Joint resource allocation and offloading strategies in cloud enabled cellular networks,2015,"The numerous features installed in recent mobile phones opened the door to a wide range of applications involving localization, storage, photo and video taking and communication. A significant number of applications involve user generated content and require intensive processing which limits dramatically the battery lifetime of featured mobile terminals. Mobile cloud computing has been recently proposed as a promising solution allowing the mobile users to run computing-intensive and energy parsimonious applications. This new feature requires new functionalities inside the cellular network architecture and needs appropriate resource allocation strategies which account for computation and communication in the same time. In this paper we present promising options to upgrade 4G architecture to support these new features. We also present two resource allocation strategies accounting for both computation and radio resources. These strategies are devised so that to minimize the energy consumption of the mobile terminals while satisfying predefined delay constraints. We compare online learning based solutions where the network adapts dynamically to the application that is run on mobile terminals, and pre-calculated offline solutions which are employed when a certain level of knowledge about the application and the channel conditions is available at the network side. We show, that even with imperfect knowledge about the application, pre-calculated offline strategies offer better performance in terms of energy consumption of mobile terminals."
2598730,21212,8228,Distributed coordinated beamforming for multi-cell multigroup multicast systems,2016,"This paper considers coordinated multicast beam-forming in a multi-cell wireless network. Each multiantenna base station (BS) serves multiple groups of single antenna users by generating a single beam with common data per group. The aim is to minimize the sum power of BSs while satisfying user-specific SINR targets. We propose centralized and distributed multicast beamforming algorithms for multi-cell multigroup systems. The NP-hard multicast problem is tackled by approximating it as a convex problem using the standard semidefinite relaxation method. The resulting semidefinite program (SDP) can be solved via centralized processing if global channel knowledge is available. To allow a distributed implementation, the primal decomposition method is used to turn the SDP into two optimization levels. The higher level is in charge of optimizing inter-cell interference while the lower level optimizes beamformers for given inter-cell interference constraints. The distributed algorithm requires local channel knowledge at each BS and scalar information exchange between BSs. If the solution has unit rank, it is optimal for the original problem. Otherwise, the Gaussian randomization method is used to find a feasible solution. The superiority of the proposed algorithms over conventional schemes is demonstrated via numerical evaluation."
353346,21212,8228,A content-centric networking forwarding design for a network processor,2015,"We describe a method to use hardware-assisted hash tables for CCNx routing on variable length names. Hardwareassisted hash tables typically have fixed key and fixed result sizes, with performance knees at specific cutoffs, such as 32 bytes or 64 bytes for combined key and result sizes. CCNx names, like a URI, use a variable number of path segments, where each segment may be of variable length. The method presented here uses a combination of standard hash lookups plus compressed key hash lookups to handle path segments that exceed the maximum fixed key size. We present results based on an EzChip NP-4 network processor. This paper presents three main results. Based on analysis of a Stanford WebBase trace, we find the first and second order statistics for URLs which clearly shows that including application state (i.e. a Query String) in the name significantly bloats the name. Second, we analyze NP4 performance using several software-based hash functions to compress long CCNx Name components. Third, we present a design for the EzChip NP4 network processor to forward CCNx interest packets. We show the feasibility of the approach based on assumptions from the URL analysis. We estimate the forwarding scheme will achieve 37 Mpps on a single 100 Gbps EzChip NP4 and be able to store 5.6 million forwarding table entries in 2 GB of RAM."
1325290,21212,8228,Connectivity restoration in disjoint wireless sensor networks using limited number of mobile relays,2013,"Disjoint Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be reconnected by placing additional relay nodes in the damaged areas. However, in some cases there may not be enough relays to reconnect all the partitions with the sink node. In such a case, some of the relays can exploit their motion capabilities and temporarily act as a mobile data collector (MDC) between partitions providing intermittent connectivity for the nodes sitting in those partitions. Nonetheless, due to increased data latency intermittent connectivity creates, the number of such MDCs need to be minimized. On the other hand, given that the energy resources for an MDC is limited, an upper bound on the travel distance overhead for an MDC needs to be imposed. This paper proposes a relay placement algorithm which guarantees connectivity by maximizing the number of stable connections while meeting the maximum tour constraint on the MDCs. The approach first determines the number and location of relays to restore connectivity by establishing stable links using a Steiner Minimum Tree (SMT) heuristic. Assuming that the number of available relays is less than the needed count, the algorithm determines how many of the available relays need to be stationary and how many of them should act as MDCs. By initially assuming all relays as MDCs, an iterative procedure is followed to reduce the MDC count while meeting the maximum tour length constraint. Specifically, groups of partitions are created and assigned to MDCs for touring. The proposed approach is validated with extensive simulations under a variety of conditions."
895553,21212,8228,Scalability and routing performance of future autonomous networks,2012,"Nowadays, the existing myriad of wireless capable devices has led to the development of numerous multi-hop routing protocols. From proactive to reactive and even hybrid routing approaches, these protocols have motivated the definition of autonomous and ubiquitous ad-hoc networks. Such networks have been idealized not only for disaster and rural scenarios, but also for an increasingly demanding social context in urban areas. However, being able to handle these networks in a large scale, still remains a challenge. Even though several routing solutions resort to clustering and hierarchies in order to limit routing information, the existing nodes' interactions are typically disregarded and mobility amongst different clusters still raises routing issues. In this work the scalability of three routing protocols will be analysed, by defining different size scenarios, while also assessing their routing performance with a mobile node moving between different clusters. Theoretical and simulation based results are presented, using twenty different possible transitions through the existing clusters. This evaluation provides an important contribution, revealing that hierarchical routing organizations' scalability is closer to what is theoretically expected, contrary to other routing solutions. Moreover, regarding the best routing performance which takes into account communities, these results motivate the further utilization of such schemes for future large scale ubiquitous networks."

The key space segment technologies include a K-band (19 GHz) MMIC-based transmit phased array antenna, and a multichannel bandwidth- and power-efficient digital encoder/modulator with an aggregate data rate of 622 Mb/s. Along with small (1.8 meter), low-cost tracking terminals on the ground, the D/sup 3/ system enables affordable distribution of data to the end user or archive facility through interoperability with commercial terrestrial telecommunications networks. The D/sup 3/ system is applicable to both government and commercial science and communications spacecraft in LEO. The features and benefits of the D/sup 3/ system concept are described. Starting with typical orbital characteristics, a set of baseline requirements for representative applications is developed, including requirements for onboard storage and tracking terminals, and sample link budgets are presented. Characteristics of the transmit array antenna and digital encoder/modulator are described.

Candidate flights of opportunity for risk mitigation and space demonstration of the D/sup 3/ features are identified."
2124972,21212,8228,Progressive Route Calculation Protocol for Wireless Mesh Networks,2007,"Although network-wide flooding in reactive routing protocols like AODV facilitates the discovery of optimal routes, they engender large control overhead. Some efficient flooding methods cut down the overhead by minimizing the set of nodes participating in packet relays. When used for route discovery, however, these approaches may suppress the detection of optimal routes. A region-based routing (REGR) protocol was proposed in to effectively reduce route discovery overhead without sacrificing route optimality. REGR defines a pre-routing region and tries to find a high-quality route by broadcasting a route request message only within the region. Although the region-limited broadcasting reduces overhead, it is actually not efficient, and may experience frequent packet collision especially in dense networks. In this paper, we propose a progressive route calculation (PROQ) protocol to locate the optimal route around a preliminary route obtained from sketchy network scanning. We propose to use progressive Dijkstra's algorithm to make nodes on the preliminary route jointly derive a minimum cost spanning tree (MCST) between a source-destination pair. The topology information needed to derive the MCST is delivered along the preliminary route by using unicast packets, which makes the new protocol more efficient and reliable than broadcast approaches. We simulate PROC and compare it with various protocols. The simulation results verify the efficiency of our method."

A number of proposals have considered moving away from the flat legacy Internet routing to a two-level hierarchical routing, separating edge networks from transit carrier networks. In this paper, we study the extended inter-domain traffic engineering capabilities arising in a transit-edge separated Internet routing, focusing on those multi-homed edge networks (e.g., small ISPs, content providers, large corporations) that aim at increasing their Internet resiliency experience. We model using game theory the interaction between distant independent edge networks exchanging large traffic volumes, with the goal of seeking efficient edge-to-edge load-balancing routing solutions. The proposed traffic engineering framework relies on a non-cooperative potential game, built upon path prepending- and path diversity- dependent costs, that indicates efficient equilibrium solution for the edge-to-edge load-balancing coordination problem. Simulations on real instances show that, in comparison with the alternative multipath BGP and normal LISP, we can achieve significantly higher resiliency and stability. In particular, our simulation for an illustrating case shows four-times more stable multipath routing solutions with a five-times larger path diversity."
2216886,21212,8228,High Resolution OFDM Channel Estimation with Low Speed ADC Using Compressive Sensing,2011,"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a technique that will prevail in the next generation wireless communication. Channel estimation is one of the key challenges in an OFDM system. In this paper, we formulate OFDM channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem, which takes advantage of the sparsity of the channel impulse response and reduces the number of probing measurements, which in turn reduces the ADC speed needed for channel estimation. Specifically, we propose sending out pilots with random phases in order to ``spread out the sparse taps in the impulse response over the uniformly downsampled measurements at the low speed receiver ADC, so that the impulse response can still be recovered by sparse optimization. This contribution leads to high resolution channel estimation with low speed ADCs, distinguishing this paper from the existing attempts of OFDM channel estimation. We also propose a novel estimator that performs better than the commonly used $\ell_1$ minimization. Specifically, it significantly reduces estimation error by combing $\ell_1$ minimization with iterative support detection and limited-support least-squares. While letting the receiver ADC running at a speed as low as $1/16$ of the speed of the transmitter DAC, we simulated various numbers of multipaths and different measurement SNRs. The proposed system has channel estimation resolution as high as the system equipped with the high speed ADCs, and the proposed algorithm provides additional 6 dB gain for signal to noise ratio."

Applications require response times ranging from a few microseconds to seconds. Therefore, network traffic within the data center needs to be managed in order to meet the requested SLAs. Current feedback congestion control protocols may be too slow to converge to a stable state under high congestion situations. Sudden bursts of traffic from heterogeneous sources may render any reactive control inefficient. In this paper, we propose PACE, a preventive explicit allocation congestion control protocol that controls resource allocations dynamically and efficiently. PACE specifically addresses Data Center requirements: efficient network usage, flow completion time guarantees, fairness in resource allocation, and scalability to hundreds of concurrent flows. PACE provides micro-allocation of network resources within dynamic periods, lossless communication, fine-grained prioritization of flows, and fast adaptation of allocations to the arrival of new flows. We simulate PACE and compare it with recent proposed protocols specially addressed to Data Centers. We demonstrate that PACE is fairer, in particular for short flows, flows with different RTTs and a higher number of concurrent flows. It also maintains high efficiency and controlled queue usage when exposed to sudden bursts."
2341723,21212,8228,QoS-Aware Load Balancing in 3GPP Long Term Evolution Multi-Cell Networks,2011,"In this paper, we investigate load balancing problem in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks and propose our solution which considers users with different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Load unbalance among neighboring cells often yields negative impacts on user experience and network performance, and it has mainly been considered for only data services without QoS guarantee. However, 3GPP LTE network aims to support multi-class services with different QoS requirements, on which the influence of load unbalance is quite different. For those with minimum rate requirements, it may result in high block probability, while for others without rate requirements, the throughput of boundary users may be degraded. In this paper, we incorporate all the differences into a network utility maximization framework and formulate it as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objectives in the problem are load balancing index of services with QoS requirements and the total utility of other services, and the constraints are physical resource limits and QoS demands. Then we analyze the complexity of the problem, and propose our solution, which includes a QoS guaranteed hybrid scheduling scheme, handover of users with and without QoS requirements, and a call admission control algorithm. Extensive simulation is conducted and the results show that the proposed framework leads to significantly better load balancing, and thus the decrease in call block probability of users with QoS requirements, and the increase in throughput of boundary best effort users."
1800574,21212,8228,Design of green optical networks with signal quality guarantee,2012,"Energy consumption of communication networks is growing very fast due to the rapidly increasing traffic demand. Consequently, design of green communication networks gained a lot of attention. In this paper we focus on optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, able to support this growing traffic demand. Several energy-aware routing and wavelength assignment (EA-RWA) techniques have been proposed for WDM networks in order to minimize their operational cost. These techniques aim at minimizing the number of active links by packing the traffic as much as possible, thus avoiding the use of lightly loaded links. As a result, EA-RWA techniques may lead to longer routes and to a high utilization on some specific links. This has a detrimental effect on the signal quality of the optical connections, i.e., lightpaths. In this study we quantify the impact of power consumption minimization on the optical signal quality. and address this problem by proposing a combined impairment and energy-aware RWA (IEA-RWA) approach. Towards this goal we developed a complete mathematical model that incorporates both linear and non-linear physical impairments together with an energy efficiency objective. The IEA-RWA problem is formulized as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model where both energy efficiency and signal quality considerations are jointly optimized. By comparing the proposed IEA-RWA approach with existing RWA (IA-RWA and EA-RWA) schemes, we demonstrate that our solution allows for a reduction of energy consumption close to the one obtained by EA-RWA approaches, while still guaranteeing a sufficient level of the optical signal quality."
2162600,21212,8228,Filling Gap between Discrete and Continuous Space Flow Models in Dense Wireless Networks,2011,"Optimizing information flow in a dense wireless network using discrete methods can be computationally prohibitive. Instead of treating the nodes as discrete entities, these networks can be modeled as continuum of nodes providing a medium for information transport. To model information routes in continuous space, information flow vector field is defined over the geographical domain of the network. At each point of the network, the orientation of the vector field shows the direction of the flow of information, and its magnitude shows the density of information flow. Using multivariate calculus techniques in continuous domain, an information flow vector field can be found such that it minimizes a suitable cost function. Then the solution is discretized. Conventionally, a centralized method of calculating the optimal information flow in the network is suggested; however, using a centralized method to optimize information flow in a dynamic network is prohibitive. Additionally, the value of information flow vector field is needed only at the locations of nodes in the network. This poses a gap between the continuous space and discrete space models of information flow in dense wireless networks. This gap is how to calculate and apply the optimum information flow derived in continuous domain in a network with finite number of nodes. As a first step to fill this gap, a specific quadratic cost function is considered. It is proved that the the vector field that minimizes this cost function is irrotational, thus it is written as the gradient of a potential function. This potential function satisfies a Poisson Partial Differential Equation (PDE) which in conjunction with Neumann boundary condition has a unique solution up to a constant. The PDE resulted by optimization in continuous domain is first discretized and then solved in a distributed fashion. The solution requires only neighboring nodes to communicate with each other. The gradient of the resulting potential defines the routes that the traffic should be forwarded."
817070,21212,8228,On the MIMO Capacity with Residual Transceiver Hardware Impairments,2014,"Radio-frequency (RF) impairments in the transceiver hardware of communication systems (e.g., phase noise (PN), high power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities, or in- phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance) can severely degrade the performance of traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although calibration algorithms can partially compensate these impairments, the remaining distortion still has substantial impact. Despite this, most prior works have not analyzed this type of distortion. In this paper, we investigate the impact of residual transceiver hardware impairments on the MIMO system performance. In particular, we consider a transceiver impairment model, which has been experimentally validated, and derive analytical ergodic capacity expressions for both exact and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We demonstrate that the capacity saturates in the high-SNR regime, thereby creating a finite capacity ceiling. We also present a linear approximation for the ergodic capacity in the low-SNR regime, and show that impairments have only a second-order impact on the capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of transceiver impairments on large-scale MIMO systems; interestingly, we prove that if one increases the number of antennas at one side only, the capacity behaves similar to the finite-dimensional case. On the contrary, if the number of antennas on both sides increases with a fixed ratio, the capacity ceiling vanishes; thus, impairments cause only a bounded offset in the capacity compared to the ideal transceiver hardware case."
1962790,21212,8228,The value of BS flexibility for QoS-aware sleep modes in cellular access networks,2014,"Sleep modes are one of the most widely investigated techniques to decrease energy consumption in cellular access networks. However, the application of such algorithms on the base station (BS) equipment of today presents several challenges. Indeed, currently installed BSs are unfit for frequent on/off cycles. This may lead to increased failure rates and malfunctioning, ultimately resulting in significant CAPEX and OPEX increases for mobile network operators (MNOs). This situation calls for a new generation of flexible BSs endowed with a ”hot standby” mode, which guarantees quick activation times without affecting BS availability. However, when such new BS models become available, MNOs will need to determine a migration path to a new network deployment with progressive replacement of old BS equipment. In this paper, we propose an approach to quantify the benefits obtained by MNOs with the deployment of flexible BSs, in terms of maximum energy efficiency achievable with a given fraction of flexible BSs in their network. More specifically, we propose a method for estimating, for a given percentage of flexible BSs, the energy optimal density of static and flexible BSs, which is sufficient to serve a given set of active users with predefined performance guarantees. We show how to apply our method to derive bounds on the maximum energy saving achievable through sleep modes, as a function of the fraction of flexible BSs. We determine the effect of uncertainty in traffic predictions on sleep modes performance, and we derive indications for optimal network planning strategies."
1355497,21212,8228,"Wi-Fi, but not on Steroids: Performance analysis of a Wi-Fi-like Network operating in TVWS under realistic conditions",2012,"The recent decisions by regulators in the USA and UK to open up unused portions of UHF spectrum for secondary use have been met with keen interest in using these TV white spaces (TVWS) for providing broadband services through Wi-Fi-like connectivity. Amid the ensuing media hype about “Wi-Fi on steroids”, there is a widespread perception that Wi-Fi operating in TVWS will provide much longer range, superior speeds, and more reliable connections than traditional Wi-Fi at 2.4 GHz. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of the performance of a network of Wi-Fi-like access points (APs) operating in TVWS in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the achievable range and downlink rate of such a secondary system. Unlike previous studies, we explicitly consider the effects of inter-AP interference and congestion and use real TVWS channel availability estimates from an example region of Germany. We confirm the favourable properties of the lower TVWS frequency range, of enabling better propagation through walls and a larger coverage range for the same power budget. Our results show that operating Wi-Fi hotspots in TVWS might be technologically attractive for outdoor rural areas where user demand is low. However, the extended coverage range in TVWS leads to increased congestion which rapidly limits the system capacity for an outdoor urban deployment with high user density. Therefore, a combined technological and economical analysis is essential before any final judgement can be reached about the viability of large-scale Wi-Fi deployments in TVWS."
843236,21212,8228,Measurement study of adjacent channel interference in mobile WLANs,2013,"Over the last few years, mobile wireless LANs (m-WLANs), which are characterized by portable access points (APs) and a small number of connected clients, are becoming popular. When a large number of such personal mobile APs operate close to each other, for example in crowded urban areas and conference venues, the quality of service (QoS) of the connected clients can be severely degraded due to co-channel and adjacent-channel interference. While there exists a large pool of literature on interference management techniques for fixed WLANs, the small form-factor mobile APs present new challenges in terms of high-density deployments and mobility-induced dynamic interference relations. The importance of minimizing interference in m-WLANs is additionally motivated from an energy-efficiency point of view. Since mobile APs rely on limited battery power, packet collisions and retransmissions have a direct impact on the on-time of the APs. In this paper, we present results from a detailed measurement study based on commercially-available m-WLAN devices - two brands of mobile APs and smartphone based clients. While the QoS characteristics of m-WLANs operating on the same channel have been investigated in prior work, we believe this is the first study of adjacent-channel interference using real-world mobile APs. Our experiments reveal the relationship between the distance between m-WLANs and the total throughput of each m-WLAN in various combinations of channels used. Further, we outline how the results can be used for designing optimal channel allocations in dense m-WLAN settings."
2493071,21212,8228,Service-Outage Capacity Maximization in Cognitive Radio,2011,"In spectrum sharing based cognitive radio networks, unlicensed users (secondary users) are allowed to communicate over the same frequency band as the licensed users (primary users) as long as the required quality-of-service (QoS) of the licensed users is guaranteed. Motivated by delay-sensitive information transmission applications, this paper focuses on a cognitive radio network, where a secondary user (SU) sharing the same frequency band with an existing primary user (PU) wishes to transmit delay-insensitive as well as delay-sensitive data while the PU is interested in meeting a minimum rate guarantee for delay-sensitive services. Typically, PU's are oblivious to the SU's existence and has its own power policy based on channel side information (CSI) of its direct gain between PU transmitter and PU receiver. Under the assumption that SU knows PU's power policy and CSI of the entire network, we solve the optimal power allocation problem of maximizing SU's ergodic capacity subject to PU's outage probability constraint (POC), SU's outage probability constraint (SOC), and SU's average power constraint. We generalize earlier results which considered either ergodic capacity maximization or outage probability minimization for SU with POC, to the so-called service-outage based capacity optimization for SU with POC. We use a rigorous probabilistic power allocation technique that allows us to derive optimal power policies that are applicable to both continuous and discrete fading channels. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the optimal power allocation algorithms."
1770119,21212,8228,Inter-Domain Path Computation using Improved Crankback Signaling in Label Switched Networks,2007,"For label switched networks, such as MPLS and GMPLS, most existing traffic engineering (TE) solutions work in a single routing domain. These solutions do not work when a route from the ingress node to the egress node leaves the routing area or the autonomous system (AS) of the ingress node. In such cases, the path computation problem becomes complicated because of the unavailability of the complete routing information throughout the network. We present CWS (computation while switching), a new inter-domain path computation scheme which tries to compute a near-optimal path without assuming the availability of complete topology information. We provide a detailed comparison of the CWS scheme with another per-domain path computation scheme given in J.-P. Vasseur et al. (2006). Unlike the standard per-domain path computation scheme (Vasseur et al., 2006), the CWS scheme continues the quest for a better path instead of terminating the search at the first available path, resulting a significant improvement in terms of path optimality. In particular, CWS guarantees that, for a given network state, a computed inter-domain path will traverse a minimum number of domains. This improvement in path computation directly impacts the amount of traffic that can be allowed on the network. For example, for the COST266 topology with 28 domains and 37 bidirectional inter-domain links, CWS places 960 of the requested 2000 paths as compared to 683 paths placed by existing schemes. Finally, the path setup latency of the CWS scheme remains comparable to that of existing schemes, by allowing the data flow as soon as the first feasible path is found."
342461,21212,8228,CooperativeQ: Energy-efficient channel access based on cooperative reinforcement learning,2015,"Cognitive Radio (CR) with the capability of discovering the unused spectrum promises higher spectrum efficiency - a pressing requirement for 5G networks. However, CR owes this capability to power-hungry tasks, most particularly to spectrum sensing. Given that advances in battery capacity has a slower pace compared to advances in device capabilities and traffic growth, it is paramount to develop energy-efficient CR protocols. To this end, we focus on spectrum sensing and access from an energy efficiency perspective. Our proposal CooperativeQ lets each CR decide with an energy efficiency objective on its actions based on its buffer occupancy, buffer capacity, and its observations about the primary channel states. Different than traditional reinforcement learning, CooperativeQ facilitates CRs to share their local knowledge with others periodically. With this information, CR chooses which action to take for the current time slot: (i) idling, (ii) sensing, and (iii) if channel is decided to be idle adapting transmission power to one of the power levels. We evaluate the performance of our proposal under various PU channel types, idling penalty coefficient, and information sharing period. Our results show that CooperativeQ outperforms greedy throughput-maximizing approach or a random channel selection owing to its adaptation and learning capability as well as cooperative mode of operation."
391067,21212,8228,Spectrum sensing in generalized multipath fading conditions using square-law combining,2015,"Energy detection constitutes a popular sensing approach thanks to its relatively satisfactory performance at low complexity requirements. Its efficiency can be practically enhanced by employing diversity schemes which are also capable of providing adequate mitigation of multipath fading effects. Based on this, the present work is devoted to the analysis of energy detection based spectrum sensing over generalized multipath fading channels using square law combining. Unlike the traditional evaluation based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the present analysis is based on the area under ROC curve (AUC), which is a particularly accurate performance measure that is used widely in natural sciences and engineering. To this end, novel closed-form expressions are firstly derived for the conventional AUC over the generalized κ − μ fading channels. These results are subsequently employed for deriving closed-form expressions for the case of square law combining. It is shown that the corresponding performance is, as expected, highly dependent upon the severity of fading and is improved substantially as the number of branches increase. In this context, it is also shown that using up to five branches ensures rather acceptable performance even at non-high signal-to-noise ratio values. Furthermore, the offered results have a relatively convenient algebraic representation and can be useful in analyses relating to cognitive radio and RADAR systems."
734346,21212,8228,Performance evaluation of partial deployment of Breadcrumbs in content oriented networks,2012,"In recent years, much work has been devoted to developing protocols and architectures for supporting the growing trend of data-oriented services. One drawback of many of these proposals is the need to upgrade or replace all the routers in order for the new systems to work. Among the few systems that allow for gradual deployment is the recently-proposed Breadcrumbs technique for distributed coordination among caches in a cache network. Breadcrumbs uses information collected locally at each cache during past downloads to support in-network guiding of current requests to desired content. Specifically, during content download a series of short-term pointers, called breadcrumbs, is set up along the download path. Future requests for this content are initially routed towards the server which holds (a copy of) this content. However, if this route leads the request to a Breadcrumbs-supporting router, this router re-directs the request in the direction of the latest downloaded, using the aforementioned pointers. Thus, content requests are initially forwarded by a location ID (e.g., IP address), but encountering a breadcrumb entry can cause a shift over to content-based routing. This property enables the Breadcrumbs system to be deployed gradually, since it only enhances the existing location-based routing mechanism (i.e. IP-based routing). In this paper we evaluate the performance of a network where Breadcrumbs is only partially deployed. Our simulation results show Breadcrumbs performs poorly when sparsely deployed. However, if an overlay of Breadcrumbs-supporting routers is setup, system performance is greatly improved. We believe that the reduced load on servers achieved with even a limited deployment of Breadcrumbs-supporting routers, combined with the flexibility of being able to deploy the system gradually, should motivate further investigation and eventual deployment of Breadcrumbs."
1932237,21212,8228,Multi-access-interference mitigation using power control in optical-CDMA star networks,2005,"This paper investigates optical power control to enhance capacity of optical CDMA star coupled networks. We consider a network in which the nodes encode their optical signal by prime codes, and the resulting error rate performance is inspected with and without power control. Network impairments, such as fiber attenuation, star coupler loss, thermal noise and shot noise, are taken into account while inspecting the number of supported users. We use a well known centralized power control algorithm to adjust the laser power levels. In short range optical networks, as for instance local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs), the thermal and shot noise levels can be very small compared to the signal level, thus, noise-free or multiple access interference (MAI) limited case is of interest. In our analysis, the star network is partitioned into access part and broadcasting part. We proof that in the MAI noise dominated scenario, the broadcasting part of the network is irrelevant with respect of the optimum power control problem. In this case, the users can apply a lookup table containing information about the access part of the network to set their optimum transmission power levels. We note that whenever a node is switched on or off, the other active nodes should update their power levels in order to maintain or upgrade their respective error rate limits."
2086898,21212,8228,Multi-Hop Capacity of MIMO-Multiplexing Relaying in WiMAX Mesh Networks,2009,"One of the main challenges for metro-scale WiMAX mesh network deployments is related to capacity scaling. In a full mesh mode, a WiMAX node acts as a mesh router as well as a client access node. To improve latency and speed performance, typical dual- and multi-radio mesh solutions use different radio channels to create separate links for access and mesh relaying services. The available spectrum is therefore split between mesh and client access services. Network operators operating the WiMAX system over the licensed spectrum are not keen to provide separate radio channels for access and mesh relay services, as this reduces the total number of users serviced per spectrum allocation. MIMO-multiplexing relaying approach however provides separate links for access and mesh relaying services on the same radio channel. In this paper, we discuss the multi-hop capacity of OFDM-based MIMO-multiplexing relaying in WiMAX networks. For an N×N MIMO-multiplexing relaying with amplification factor α at relay nodes, R-hops relaying degrade the capacity by at most -Nlog2(α2R/(1+ΣRr=1 α2r Nr)) +RNlog2(N) bits/sec/Hz. Therefore, greater capacity loss is experienced in networks employing high-order MIMO-multiplexing relaying. We also show that the capacity loss is independent of the OFDM configurations employed; thus network operators could employ higher OFDM configurations to compensate data rate loss in access services when some of the MIMO-multiplexing links are dedicated to mesh relay. This analysis provides useful guidelines for operators planning MIMO-multiplexing option for mesh support in WiMAX network."
2437446,21212,8228,SoftEPC — Dynamic instantiation of mobile core network entities for efficient resource utilization,2013,"Existing mobile network infrastructures, for example the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), are based on mission specific, specialized network nodes/entities that are interconnect via standardized interfaces in a static manner, each providing a specific service/function. One common practice adopted by many Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in order to cater to increasing traffic demand is the over provisioning of network and processing resources. However, this approach results in increased CAPEX and OPEX and in view of future load forecasts this approach is no longer considered feasible or economical. In this paper we address this specific issue and propose the concept of softEPC, which leverages the recent advances in cloud technology concept such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and virtualization techniques in the realm of mobile networks. A softEPC is considered as a virtual network of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) functions over a physical transport network topology. This will enable the on-demand and load-aware dynamic instantiation of network functions and services at appropriate locations in response to the actual traffic demand. The main objective of this approach is to increase the utilization of network resources by flexibly and dynamically placing the network functions/services where most appropriate to provide optimum service and where resources are available to increase the number of services provided to mobile users. The benefits and gains of this approach will be demonstrated by means of simulation results."
2801499,21212,8228,Trade-off between spectral efficiency increase and PAPR reduction when using FTN signaling: Impact of non linearities,2016,"Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling appears as an attractive method to improve spectral efficiency at the price of an increased complexity at the receiver. The receiver generally implements a turbo-equalization/detection scheme to benefit from all the promises of the FTN signaling. However, this is not the only limitation we have to deal with. Indeed, compressing in the time domain impact the emitted signal and it usually results in an increase of the envelope fluctuations. This leads to an inherent multi-objectives trade-off between performance, targeted spectral efficiency and limited Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The last aspect is crucial when considering a satellite communication link due to non-linear amplification effects that can occur on-board the satellite. Usually, FTN studies focus on spectral efficiency increase for a fixed modulation order, trying to trade-off between performance and PAPR properties. In this paper, we show that, for a given asymptotic spectral efficiency, we can compress low order modulations to increase the spectral efficiency of these schemes while controlling the PAPR increase to achieve a better PAPR than the non compressed scheme with a higher modulation order. Thus, for the same asymptotic spectral efficiency, we can achieve 1 dB gain in terms of PAPR and 2 dB gain in Bit Error Rate (BER) performances for a coded 8-PSK FTN system compared to a coded 16-APSK. For the same BER performances, the asymptotic spectral efficiency gain obtained in linear context is over 20 %, higher when non-linearities are taken into account."
346528,21212,8228,Capacity analysis of interlaced clustering in a distributed antenna system,2015,"Low signal strength and high interference lead to significantly reduced data-rates at the cell edge. With rising demand for spectrum and systems moving closer to universal frequency reuse, the problem has become more pronounced. Techniques like Fractional Frequency Reuse boost the edgeuser performance at the cost of the spectral efficiency and are therefore sub-optimal. In this paper we investigate interlaced clustering as a solution to the edge user problem for a general distributed cellular transmission system, and explore a multicell Distributed Antenna System as a particular example. In interlaced clustering, different parts of the spectrum use coverage patterns that are spatially shifted (by less than a cell size) replicas of each other. An information theoretic analysis is presented to characterize the proportional fairness boundary point of the achievable rate region. In the process, the joint resource allocation problem is formulated and shown to be convex. As opposed to using interior point methods which are relatively slower, the current paper proposes a novel gradientsearch algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem. It is demonstrated that fractional frequency reuse can in fact be represented as a special (albeit sub-optimal) case of interlaced clustering. Simulation results show that interlaced clustering can boost the edge-user rates by a factor of 2 with negligible degradation of rates in the cell interior. Results also show that interlaced clustering outperforms the edge-user rates achieved with fractional frequency reuse by a factor of 1∶5. The theoretical results are validated by comparing performance to a practical proportional fairness scheduler."
2471921,21212,8228,Infrastructure Sharing and Shared Operations for Mobile Network Operators: From a Deployment and Operations View,2008,"The traditional and still prevailing mobile network operator (MNO) business model is based on the carrier's full ownership of the physical network assets. However, rapid and complex technology migration, regulatory requirements, and increasing capital expenditures on one side and competitive environments, saturated markets, and pressure on margins on the other side advocate a new paradigm: the focus on critical success factors and key assets. Simultaneously, telecommunications equipment is commoditized. These trends are paving the way for the sharing of network infrastructure in the core and radio access networks among multiple operators. Challenges arise with regard to technical solutions to enable such business models in a multi-vendor landscape, but also in the context of the principal-agent-problem accompanying the re-allocation of assets and operational duties. This paper investigates the current technological, regulatory, and business landscape from the perspective of sharing network resources, and proposes several different approaches and technical solutions for network sharing. We introduce a model for estimating savings on capital and operating expenses, and present the results of our simulations for the various scenarios. Finally, we assess the benefits of managed services for the shared network case, a potentially highly attractive model to overcome some of the challenges posed by infrastructure sharing."
2279802,21212,8228,"Automatic Protection, Restoration, and Survivability of Long-Reach Passive Optical Networks",2011,"The long-reach passive optical network (LR-PON) is receiving significant research attention due to its potential in delivering future bandwidth intensive services to a significantly higher number of customers at a lower unit cost of bandwidth. Carrying substantially higher traffic over increased distances as compared to conventional PONs, the survivability of these networks is a key feature that must be addressed to ensure end-to-end network reliability. Further, as these networks are optically amplified to extend its coverage, measures to detect and remove hazardous high power exposure at the fiber break are also critical. Here, we propose, experimentally demonstrate, and characterize a simple automatic protection switching scheme that exploits the use of a highly-sensitive and fast-response protection module to achieve traffic diversion to the protection path within 12 ms of failure detection. The protection module also provides an additional flexibility of activating amplifier shutdown within 2 ms of failure detection, thereby removing the hazard at the fiber break. We also perform numerical analyses of LR-PON survivability based on the probabilistic nature of fiber link failures, for conventional traffic as well as for peer-to-peer sharing over the LR-PON. Our results highlight that the level of improvement in survivability from optical protection in an LR-PON is dependent on the probability link failure of each stage of the network."
2039817,21212,8228,On the Reliability of Multi-Hop Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks Supporting QoS Driven Applications,2007,"This paper addresses the problem of evaluating the reliability of a single-radio, multi-channel, multi-hop dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network supporting QoS-driven network services. We define reliability as the reciprocal of the probable number of transmission attempts required to ship each unit of application data successfully under a given demand. The demand represents the flow rate (per unit of time) at which an application needs to be served. We provide analytical methods of reliability evaluation for two classes of DSA network service. 1. A network servicing a single source-destination pair and 2. A network servicing a broadcasting or multicasting application where common data has to be disseminated to all or a subset of nodes in the network. All the nodes involved in data communication are secondary nodes, which access the channels reserved for primary users, in an unlicensed manner. Our methods take into account the channel capacities of the links and provide an useful and an important metric for the effectiveness of a dynamic spectrum access network for a given demand. These methods can also be used to find robust routing paths in such networks. The approach we use is based on concepts in mathematical theory of reliability and theory of network flows. Our methodologies are scalable, simple to implement and can be extended to all other types of communication networks and network applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address reliability issues in DSA networks."
2850063,21212,8228,Formulation of path selection by means of maximum flow and minimum delay on a Free Space Optical topology,2016,"Wireless radio-frequency (RF) technologies has had universal wide-scale deployment. Despite this, the practical limitations of the RF spectrum being unable to meet the challenges (e.g. lack of security, high interference, limited bandwidth, scalability) of RF based communication networks have become increasingly apparent over the past decade. With the ever-growing of data heavy wireless communications, especially on the last mile (e.g. wireless mesh network) and the backbone, methods are required to help addresses the problem RF have been facing for the next generation network. Faced with such daunting obstacles in RF-only networks, the use of Free Space Optical (FSO) for wireless communications was proposed. FSO is a promising solution to security, limited spectrum bandwidth, the scalability problem of wireless mesh networks, but also the advantage of large transmission distance, free license, interference immunity, and high-bandwidth. Despite the major advantages of FSO technology, its widespread use has been hampered by atmospheric turbulence-induced fading. However, FSO is still consider to be a practical solution to RF challenges. To maximize the potential of FSO networks, we study the problem of maximum path resource flow for a route and minimum linear delay while the FSO topology under atmospheric turbulence. Such methods can be easy adopted to SDN to manage the data flow at the link-or network-layer."
2071059,21212,8228,User scheduling for coordinated dual satellite systems with linear precoding,2013,"The constantly increasing demand for interactive broadband satellite communications is driving current research towards novel system architectures that reuse frequency in a more aggressive manner. To this end, the topic of dual satellite systems, in which satellites share spatial (i.e. same coverage area) and spectral (i.e. full frequency reuse) degrees of freedom is introduced. In each multibeam satellite, multiuser interferences are mitigated by employing zero forcing precoding with realistic per antenna power constraints. However, the two sets of users that the transmitters are separately serving, interfere. The present contribution, proposes the partial cooperation, herein referred to as coordination, between the two coexisting transmitters in order to reduce interferences and enhance the performance of the whole system, while maintaining moderate system complexity. In this direction, a heuristic, iterative, low complexity algorithm that allocates users in the two interfering sets is proposed. This novel algorithm, improves the performance of each satellite and of the overall system, simultaneously. The first is achieved by maximizing the orthogonality between users allocated in the same set, hence optimizing the zero forcing performance, whilst the second by minimizing the level of interferences between the two sets. Simulation results show that the proposed method, compared to conventional techniques, significantly increases spectral efficiency."
352705,21212,8228,Auction-based spectrum sharing among heterogeneous secondary networks,2015,"Exploitation of underutilized spectrum is an effective approach to meet the explosive demand for wireless communications. When heterogeneous secondary networks (HSNs) are allowed to operate in the same underutilized spectrum, their coexistence becomes a critical issue. This paper considers a coexistence network that involves one spectrum provider (SP) sharing unused spectrum resources to multiple HSNs. To coordinate interference-free spectrum sharing among these HSNs, this paper adopts an auction-based approach and designs an Unilateral Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based Auction for HSNs (UVAH). UVAH has three novel designs that make it a practical and efficient solution. Firstly, effective partition of auction regions takes into account the SP's non-uniform amount of supply units in a target area. Secondly, based on the partition, UVAH provides HSNs with a highly expressive package bidding format to freely specify the amount of demand units and operating regions. Lastly virtual bidders by regions are introduced so as to resolve the revenue deficiency problem of VCG while retaining the property of truthfulness. With these three designs, UVAH maximizes the social welfare of the coexistence network without sacrificing the overall spectrum utilization. Numerical analysis shows that, compared to the existing solutions, UVAH improves spectrum utilization, spectrum revenue and HSN satisfaction by 9.96%, 17.26% and 121.73%, respectively."
2168742,21212,8228,Distributed Space-Time Block Coded OFDM for Relay-Assisted Transmission,2006,"In this paper, we investigate orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique for distributed space-time block coding (D-STBC) in a relay-assisted transmission scenario over frequency-selective fading channels. We consider the special case of a single-relay where the source-to-relay (S ? R), relay-to-destination (R ? D) and source-to-destination (S ? D) links experience possibly different channel delay spreads. Our analysis demonstrates that uncoded distributed OFDM-STBC (D-OFDM-STBC) scheme achieves a maximum diversity order of two for the considered single-relay scenario since it is able to exploit only the spatial diversity, but not the available rich multipath diversity. We further consider a combination of D-OFDM-STBC and Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) with frequency-interleaving. Under the assumption of perfect power control for the relay terminal and high signal-to-noise ratio for the underlying links, our performance analysis demonstrates that D-OFDM-STBC scheme with judiciously designed outer TCM codes, i.e. sufficiently large effective code length (ECL), is able to achieve a maximum diversity order of min(L1, L3) + L2 + 2 where L1, L2, and L3 are the channel memory lengths for S ? R, S ? D and R ? D links, respectively. This illustrates that the smaller of the multipath diversity orders experienced in S ? R and R ? D links becomes the performance bottleneck for the relaying path. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is presented to corroborate the analytical results and to provide further insights into the performance."
2373683,21212,8228,An Adaptive Resource/Performance Trade-Off for Resolving Complex Queries in P2P Networks,2009,"Structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are increasingly important for scalable data dissemination and search. Current distributed approaches for resolving complex search queries, like multi-attribute and range queries, typically require multiple query messages to resolve a single search request. To reduce the message overhead and the search latency, some approaches like the Multi-Attribute Addressable Network (MAAN) use static replication. However, this results in high main memory requirements and large data transfers each time a device joins the P2P network. Those drawbacks can be tolerated for P2P networks that mainly consist of fixed, powerful nodes like PCs but are intolerable for resource-constrained nodes with high churn, like mobile devices. As mobile devices will play a significant role in accessing and distributing data in the future, we propose and evaluate an improved search mechanism for such a scenario. Compared to MAAN, our approach significantly reduces the memory footprint and bandwidth requirements (up to a factor of five in our sample scenario). At the same time, the good latency properties of MAAN are remained on average. This is achieved via a dynamic replication scheme which introduces an adjustable trade-off between memory footprint and search latency. Thereby, our approach makes efficient, distributed resolution of complex queries in resource-constrained P2P networks feasible."
338908,21212,8228,CI/DS-CDMA scheme for autonomous underwater vehicle communication,2015,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are deployed in search and rescue operations where it is difficult for divers to reach. During the operation a fleet of AUVs communicate among themselves and exchange two type of information. The first includes control signal which has a low-data rate but has a very stringent bit error rate (BER) requirement and the second being the data collected by the AUVs in the form of high resolution video, pictures and important sensor observations, which has a high-data rate but a little relaxed BER constraint. This paper proposes an efficient two-rate data transmission scheme for AUV communication using carrier interferometry (CI) coded direct sequence code-division multiple access (CI/DS-CDMA). The BER performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the conventional Walsh Hadamard (WH) coded DS-CDMA in underwater channel and is shown to ensure improved BER performance. For two-rate communication we assume a basic low-data rate (LDR) “R” and a high-data rate (HDR) as “2R” and we further presume that the acceptable BER of LDR is atleast an order of magnitude less than that of the HDR. Simulation results show that with CI/DS-CDMA scheme, the high-data rate communication achieves a BER of 3×10 −4  at 20 dB whereas the low data rate communication reach a BER of 1.76×10 −5  at 16 dB for a typical underwater channel. The results justify CI/DS-CDMA scheme as a deserving candidate for single rate as well as two-rate underwater acoustic communication."
2176572,21212,8228,Network Lifetime Optimization by Duality Approach for Multi-Source and Single-Sink Topology in Wireless Sensor Networks,2007,"The multi-source and single-sink (MSSS) topology, in wireless sensor networks, is defined as the network topology, where all of nodes can gather, receive and transmit data to the sink. We consider the problem of finding the joint optimal scheme with consideration of physical, medium access control (MAC), and network layers to maximize the network lifetime (NL) for the MSSS topology in the energy-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The optimization problem, when the link access is an interference-free time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, can be formulated as a mixed integer-convex programming and relaxed to the convex programming. According to the transcendental equations in programming model, we take two rather different approaches to maximize the NL in such network. First, based on the result of the SSSS network, we decompose the MSSS problem into the various SSSS issues. Another approach is to utilize the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimization conditions to analytically solve this convex problem. Analytical expression of the optimal NL is a function of the initial energy and quantities of data held by the sources, taking the influence of data rates, link access and routing method into account. Although some dual gaps exist, the analytical result agrees well with numerical result of optimization solver, and can be applied to algorithms in WSNs aiming at maximizing NL."
2890129,21212,8228,Pinball attacks: Exploiting channel allocation in wireless networks,2016,"As wireless networks continue to grow rapidly denser with the introduction of various wireless-enabled elements, signal interference coupled with limited radio spectrum availability emerges as a significant hindrance to network performance. In order to retain high network throughput, channels must be strategically assigned to nodes in a way that minimizes signal overlap between neighboring nodes. Current static channel assignment techniques are intolerant of network variations and growth, but flexible dynamic techniques are becoming more feasible with the introduction of software defined networks and network function virtualization. As network maintenance tasks are increasingly handled by software, however, network stability becomes susceptible to malicious behavior. In this paper, we adopt an attacker's prespective and expose stealthy attacks — which we coin “pinball” Attacks — that aim to trigger unnecessary channel switching behavior in a network and increase signal interference between neighboring nodes. We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and investigate suboptimal attack policies applied to a number of real-world topologies. We derive attack policies as approximate MDP solutions due to the exponentially large state space. Our results show that pinball attack outperforms other attack policies such as Denial of Service, Random, and other heuristic policies."
692014,21212,8228,QoS based scheduling for incorporating variable rate coded voice in Bluetooth,2001,"Bluetooth is an emerging standard low-cost indoor pico-cellular wireless systems. It is a master driven time division duplex (TDD) system. Real time services such as voice are given 64 kbps bandwidth in Bluetooth. However most other wireless networks use compressed voice, which requires much lesser bandwidth, leading to a substantial increase in system capacity. Bandwidth can be further conserved by using voice activity detection (VAD) techniques and variable rate voice codecs. We propose and analyse modifications to be made to Bluetooth for incorporating variable rate coded voice. Current mechanisms in Bluetooth use synchronous channels with fixed slot allocation for voice and a best effort service for data. We propose and study two scheduling strategies which optimise bandwidth consumption by using variable rate coded voice. In the first scheme, adaptive T/sub SCO/ scheduling, we modify the conventional scheduling policy to change the time period of scheduling a voice channel depending upon its activity. In the voice over ACL scheduling, we schedule voice asynchronously like data using a QoS based scheduling scheme with maximum scheduling delay tolerable by packets as the QoS parameter. This scheme can also be used to schedule other multimedia applications with varying QoS requirements. We observe from simulations that the voice over ACL scheme gives more than 115% increase in bandwidth over the currently used scheduling in the presence of two voice connections."
832682,21212,208,Goodput maximization in opportunistic spectrum access radio links with imperfect spectrum sensing and fec-based packet protection,2012,"We consider a cognitive radio scenario where the communication between two secondary users (SUs) exploits opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) over a wireless channel licensed to primary users (PUs). Assuming a slotted MAC over a single frequency channel and imperfect spectrum sensing, we address the problem of determining the packet size and Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding rate that maximize the SU communication goodput, i.e., the amount of payload bits correctly received in the unit time. Assuming a Markovian model for the PU activity, a saturation regime for the SU, and periodic channel sensing, we find out the mean time between two consecutive packet transmissions and derive approximate analytical expressions, in closed form, which provide upper and lower bounds on the SUs goodput. Such expressions show the dependence of the SU goodput on packet size, FEC coding rate, signal to noise plus interference ratio, amount of resources allocated to sensing, packet overhead, and primary traffic statistics. We provide simulation results showing that the derived analytical expressions are very close to the actual system performance. We also evaluate the sensitivity of the optimal packet size and FEC coding rate pair to the operational conditions represented by the received power and the PU traffic load, showing that the optimal pair is very sensitive to the former, and only moderately affected by the latter."
283340,21212,8228,Interference cancellation based transmission strategy using primary ARQ for cooperative CRNs,2015,"Aiming at efficient utilizing the licensed spectrum, in this paper, we develop an interference cancellation based transmission strategy (ICTS) for the cooperative cognitive radio networks (CRN) which will take advantage of the opportunities that arise during the primary automatic repeat requests (ARQ) and cancel the primary interference in both the primary initial transmission and retransmission slots. Simultaneously, the secondary system will cooperate with the primary system by supporting its outage quality-of-service (QoS) requirement to speedup the primary transmission and acquire more interference-free spectrum opportunities. Specifically, in the primary initial transmission slot, the secondary users (SU) will transmit in the underlay mode. In addition, SUs try to decode the primary signal to cancel the primary interference and overhear the primary ARQ signal. In the retransmission slot, SUs can cancel the primary interference directly when the primary signal is successfully decoded in the initial slot or utilize the primary information redundancy to cancel the interference. With statistical channel state information (CSI), SUs can calculate their interference cancellation probabilities in both slots and derive their average transmission rate. To maximize SUs' average transmission rate while meeting PUs outage QoS requirement, we formulate the optimization problem and efficiently allocate SUs transmit power. The closed-form expressions of the average transmission rates for both PUs and SUs are derived. Furthermore, SUs' upper bound symbol error probability (SEP) and PUs' SEP are derived. Simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority of our developed ICTS over conventional ARQ-based transmission strategies in terms of SUs' average throughput and PUs' outage probability and SEP."
1521635,21212,8228,MIMO multi-user secrecy rate analysis,2014,"In this paper, we consider the broadcast channel with confidential messages and eavesdroppers (BCCE), where a multi-antenna base station simultaneously communicates to multiple potentially malicious users, in the presence of external eavesdroppers randomly located according to a Poisson point process (PPP). By using techniques from stochastic geometry and random matrix theory, we obtain explicit expressions for the secrecy outage probability and mean secrecy rate achievable with regularized channel inversion precoding. We show that both these metrics scale as λe √ N , where N is the number of transmit antennas and λe is the density of external eavesdroppers. eavesdropping was assumed from the malicious users only. The presence of external eavesdroppers and its effect on the secure connectivity in random wireless networks were studied, among others, in (10)-(12) via stochastic geometry (SG), but the system model did not account for the potentially malicious behavior of the users. In a practical scenario, both malicious users and external nodes can act as eavesdroppers. A physical layer security system designed by considering either one of them should be regarded as vulnerable. For these reasons, it is of critical importance to study broadcast channels with confidential messages and external eavesdroppers. In this paper, we introduce the broadcast channel with confidential messages and eavesdroppers (BCCE) to model a scenario where both malicious users and randomly located external nodes can act as eavesdroppers. We use results from both stochastic geometry and random matrix theory to study the performance of RCI precoding in the BCCE. Stochastic geometry is a powerful tool to study a large network with a random distribution of external eavesdroppers (13), whereas random matrix theory enables a deterministic abstraction of the physical layer, for a fixed network topology (14). We obtain the probability of secrecy outage and the mean secrecy rate achievable by RCI precoding in the BCCE under Rayleigh fading, for the two cases of non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers. We find that both (i) the probability of secrecy outage, and (ii) the rate loss due to the presence of external eavesdroppers scale as λ e √ N , where N is the number of transmit"
1867565,21212,8228,Analysis of Uplink Traffic Characteristics and Impact on Performance in Mobile Data Networks,2008,"User-generated content (UGC) also known as user- created content (UCC) refers to various kinds of media contents that are produced by end users. A recent trend in the use of the Internet exhibits that data traffic from UGC is rapidly growing with the potential to create a huge amount of uplink traffic for wireless operators. As the reality of UGC's scope and power is becoming crystalized, modeling and analysis of uplink traffic has just begun to receive growing attention in the wireless community. Consequently, we have also analyzed live uplink traffic traces obtained by monitoring 3G networks of a mobile data service provider (SK Telecom in Korea). Our statistical analysis shows the self-similarity in this traffic trace. In order to evaluate the impact of this characteristics on mobile data networks, we use the WiMAX module available in OPNET software. Our trace-driven simulation results indicate burstiness in the aggregated traffic received at a base station (BS) as well as in the traffic generated at each subscriber station (SS). The impact of the data burst at SSs is shown to be negligible when the overall traffic load is relatively small but become significant when a large volume of delay-sensitive traffic is generated in many SSs even if the overall network load is less than the network capacity."
2174786,21212,8228,Performance evaluations on a bandwidth on demand algorithm for a high capacity multimedia satellite network,2000,"There are many system proposals for satellite-based multimedia communications that promise high capacity and ease of access. Many of these proposals require advanced switching technology and signal processing on-board satellites that will directly impact their cost, performance, availability, and time-to-market. Given the amount of commercial and technical risk involved in such complex systems, satellite operators have been looking for solutions that are simpler, yet flexible. One solution is based on a geosynchronous (GEO) satellite system equipped with simple on-board processing and switching. The satellite network is ATM-based and carries heterogeneous traffic. An important feature of this system is allowing for a maximum number of simultaneous users, hence, requiring effective connection admission control (CAC) and bandwidth on demand (BOD) algorithms. Nortel Networks has already developed an innovative CAC and BOD algorithm for the system. We present the BOD performance evaluations of the integrated algorithm. By detailed simulations, we show that the BOD scheme is able to efficiently utilize all available bandwidth and to gain high throughput. We also find that the end-to-end delays for voice traffic in the system falls well within the ITU's QoS specification for GEO-based satellite systems. The application buffer sizes observed in the simulations can serve as a guideline for ground station and satellite on-board memory design."
1716769,21212,8228,On the Capacity Degradation in Broadband MIMO Satellite Downlinks with Atmospheric Impairments,2010,"We investigate the impact of atmospheric impairments on the theoretical bandwidth efficiency of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) geostationary satellite links which are shaped to optimize the channel bandwidth efficiency. We analyze the impairments caused by precipitation, since this is the most severe atmospheric effect causing capacity degradations. By theory, the MIMO channel capacity is strongly affected by signal attenuation as well as signal phase shifts that might reduce the number and strength of spatial subchannels (eigenmodes). We will show, however, that the characteristics of the phase disturbances prevent a loss of capacity. Regarding the additional attenuation, which the signals may encounter passing through the troposphere, we will quantify outage values for several levels of link capacity degradation. Although a loss of capacity cannot be avoided in total, it still turns out that MIMO systems outperform conventional Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) designs in terms of reliability. Even in the presence of atmospheric perturbations, MIMO systems still provide enormous capacity gains and vast reliability improvements. Thus, the MIMO satellite systems presented are perfectly suited to establish the backbone network of future broadband wireless standards (e.g. DVB-SH), supporting high data rates for a variety of worldwide services."
2882448,21212,8228,Software-defined exchange for the virtualized WiFi network towards future Mobile Cloud services,2016,"This paper proposes a software-defined exchange (SDX) scheme for the federation of the virtualized WiFi system and the VNode system, a deeply programmable network virtualization platform, to facilitate Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) over SDN. We envision the future MCC services, where QoE of the services is further enhanced by SDN's capabilities such as auto-scaling of the network resources to accommodate fluctuated traffic, and seamless migration of server-side programs to the network edge. Towards the future MCC, a cross-domain federated virtual network (slice) across wireless and wired domains is needed, while individual slice operations and policies in each domain should be maintained for supporting the diversity of virtualization technologies. Though some SDX schemes have been proposed in the literature, they implicitly assume inter-connection of virtualized wired domains and it is difficult to apply them to virtualized wireless domains. To address this issue, in this paper we focus on the federation between the VNode and the virtualized WiFi platform through the Slice Exchange Point (SEP) framework as a case study, and specifically propose the WiFi portal function that enables the SEP to inter-connect a VNode slice and a WiFi slice by translation between the common slice description defined by SEP and the WiFi-specific one. This paper shows the design of the WiFi portal and its implementation on the virtualized WiFi prototype system. We build an experimental system using the two virtualized WiFi base stations and four VNode nodes, and demonstrate a wide-area federated slice can be dynamically built in 238 seconds without any manual operation."
1709936,21212,20754,Authenticating Primary Users' Signals in Cognitive Radio Networks via Integrated Cryptographic and Wireless Link Signatures,2010,"To address the increasing demand for wireless bandwidth, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been proposed to increase the efficiency of channel utilization; they enable the sharing of channels among secondary (unlicensed) and primary (licensed) users on a non-interference basis. A secondary user in a CRN should constantly monitor for the presence of a primary user's signal to avoid interfering with the primary user. However, to gain unfair share of radio channels, an attacker (e.g., a selfish secondary user) may mimic a primary user's signal to evict other secondary users. Therefore, a secure primary user detection method that can distinguish a primary user's signal from an attacker's signal is needed. A unique challenge in addressing this problem is that Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits any modification to primary users. Consequently, existing cryptographic techniques cannot be used directly. In this paper, we develop a novel approach for authenticating primary users' signals in CRNs, which conforms to FCC's requirement. Our approach integrates cryptographic signatures and wireless link signatures (derived from physical radio channel characteristics) to enable primary user detection in the presence of attackers. Essential to our approach is a {\em helper node} placed physically close to a primary user. The helper node serves as a bridge to enable a secondary user to verify cryptographic signatures carried by the helper node's signals and then obtain the helper node's authentic link signatures to verify the primary user's signals. A key contribution in our paper is a novel physical layer authentication technique that enables the helper node to authenticate signals from its associated primary user. Unlike previous techniques for link signatures, our approach explores the geographical proximity of the helper node to the primary user, and thus does not require any training process."
2710497,21212,8228,A matching game for data trading in operator-supervised user-provided networks,2016,"In this paper, we consider a recent cellular network connection paradigm, known as a user-provided network (UPN), where users share connectivity and act as an access point for other users. To incentivize user participation in this network, we allow the users to trade their data plan and obtain a profit by selling and buying leftover data capacities (caps) from each other. We formulate the data trading association between buyers and sellers as a matching game. In this game, buyers and sellers rank each other based on preference functions that capture the buyers' demand for data and QoS requirements, the data available for purchase from the sellers and energy resources. We show that these preferences are interdependent and influenced by existing network-wide matching. For this reason, the game can be classified as a one-to-many matching game with externalities. To solve the game, we propose a distributed algorithm that combines notions from matching theory and market equilibrium. The algorithm enables the players to self-organize into a stable matching and ensures dynamic adaptation of price to data demand and supply. The properties of the resulting matching are discussed. We also calculate operator gains and the benchmark price that will encourage users to join the UPN. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields average utility per user improvements of up to 25% and 50% relative to random matching and worst case utility, respectively."
2030912,21212,8228,Channel estimation with hard limiter receiver as key technology for low cost wireless systems,2003,"Future wireless indoor network applications require technologies that allow high data rate transmission in multipath propagation environment. The acceptance of new technologies will depend essentially on the expense of its realization. A key technology for link level cost reduction is the use of hard (amplitude) limiting receiver structures that substantially save the costs for the analogue domain of the receivers [J.P. Fonseka, 1996][A. Wittneben and U. Dettmar, 1997]. Technologies suited for multipath propagation, such as ML based detection or smart antennas training, require the knowledge of the complex channel impulse response (CIR) [J.G. Proakis, 1995][M. Kuhn, 2002]. A method on how to estimate the complex CIR in case of a hard limited receiver structure is needed. In this paper, an estimation method is presented that allows an estimation of the complex CIR on basis of phase samples. The new estimation technique is a two level approach, which exploits the finite-state nature of the transmission system. With the help of an appropriate training sequence an estimate of the desired phase and amplitude is performed. The second level procedure performs a subspace approach to estimate the CIR, which yields a well treatable overdetermined linear equation system. Simulation results for a GMSK transmission system highlight the suitability of this estimation method."
2415020,21212,8228,Least Squares Disclosure Attack in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,2011,"Traffic analysis is considered the most powerful strategy of disclosing the hidden communication relations in an anonymous communication system. Statistical traffic analysis attacks are even more subtle in that the attackers are usually eavesdroppers who do not modify the network's behaviors. Moreover, the attackers even do not need to look into the traffic content, which may be encrypted, in order to analyze the statistical characteristics. Such attacks have been thoroughly investigated for static wireline networks. However, none of these mechanisms can be directly applied to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to the inability to deal with mobility, the ad hoc infrastructure and the broadcasting nature of wireless transmissions. Recent research conducted on statistical traffic analysis attacks targeting MANETs is restricted to disclosing the end-to-end traffic distribution. In this paper, we present the least squares disclosure attack (LSDA), targeting a popular MANET routing strategy, that is, the position based routing (PBR, a.k.a geographic routing). LSDA utilizes the traffic distribution disclosed by existing solutions, and de-anonymizes the network communication on a per-flow basis by identifying the source and destination of each end-to-end flow. In LSDA, traffic disclosure is modeled as an efficiently solvable least squares problem subject to linear constraints . The empirical study demonstrates that, the proposed solution can de-anonymize the network flows in high accuracy."
1290175,21212,8228,Information as a service based architectural solution for WSN,2012,"Wireless Sensors have seen a lot of applications in our daily lives in the recent years. The market has been flooded with high end consumer electronics using wireless sensor technology. However, most of the current technologies require the sensor to be in the vicinity of the end-user application. There has been some study in the techniques for sensor provisioning and sharing for the large number of existing Wireless Sensor Networks. Virtualization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a step forward in exposing these WSNs to large user base from remote locations. However, there is still a huge gap in bringing together information available from heterogeneous, distributed resources of Wireless Sensor Networks to a non-localized user. In this work, we utilize IaaS paradigm of Cloud Computing in virtualization of sensor networks which gives the flexibility of handling heterogeneous systems. The system also enables a smart device user to access information generated by Wireless Sensors through the cloud via SaaS based design. This allows the system to take common computational tasks to be hosted as a service through the cloud. It frees the smart device user from running heavy applications for data processing and storing. Thus, system provides the smart device user a Cloud Enabled Wireless Sensor Network infrastructure. The system architecture provides the necessary features for it to be scalable and flexible, ensuring reliable sensor data transfer and processing through cloud infrastructure. We also present a small test bed implementation of the system."
1993959,21212,21855,In-band spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: energy detection or feature detection?,2008,"In a cognitive radio network (CRN), in-band spectrum sensing is essential for the protection of legacy spectrum users, with which the presence of primary users (PUs) can be detected promptly, allowing secondary users (SUs) to vacate the channels immediately. For in-band sensing, it is important to meet the detectability requirements, such as the maximum allowed latency of detection (e.g., 2 seconds in IEEE 802.22) and the probability of mis-detection and false-alarm. In this paper, we propose an effcient periodic in-band sensing algorithm that optimizes sensing-frequency and sensing-time by minimizing sensing overhead while meeting the detectability requirements. The proposed scheme determines the better of energy or feature detection that incurs less sensing overhead at each SNR level, and derives the threshold  aRSS threshold   on the average received signal strength (RSS) of a primary signal below which feature detection is preferred. We showed that energy detection under lognormal shadowing could still perform well at the average SNR  SNR wall   [1] when collaborative sensing is used for its location diversity. Two key factors affecting detection performance are also considered: noise uncertainty and inter-CRN interference.  aRSS threshold   appears to lie between -114.6 dBm and -109.9 dBm with the noise uncertainty ranging from 0.5 dB to 2 dB, and between -112.9 dBm and -110.5 dBm with 1~6 interfering CRNs."
1320427,21212,21102,FIS based cognitive radio scheduling,2013,"Cognitive radio is the latest technology paradigm enabling dynamic spectrum access for exploiting unused spectrum resources, cross-layer optimization and achieving optimal system performance using learning and reasoning techniques. This paper derives a generalized decision surface for opportunistic spectrum scheduling by cognitive users in licensed spectrum using Fuzzy Inference System. The proposed FIS has incorporated the PU-SU distance and signal strength inputs in a logical reasoning to balance the tradeoff between spectrum sensing accuracy and interference to PU. The influence of the shape of the MF on the dynamics of the variation in decision making has been evaluated for a spectrum sharing model using different secondary user parameters as input: signal power, spectrum utilization efficiency, degree of mobility and its distance to the primary user. The capabilities of two different rule base frameworks have been compared to develop an optimized FIS structure in terms of the type of membership function for predicting the best scheduled set of secondary users. Simulation results show the feasibility of evaluating CR scheduling with the evaluated possibility factors from built-in fuzzy inference decision surfaces. The superiority of the trapezoidal MF and the distance-factor trade-off inclusive 81 rule base in this regard is also clearly established."
561408,21212,8228,Adaptive cell sectoring using fixed overlapping sectors in CDMA networks,2001,"The problem of base station antenna assignment (BSAA) with minimum mobile transmit power (MTP) is studied for CDMA networks that employ fixed overlapping sector antenna architecture (FOSAA). It is noted that the non-FOSAA has limitations in switching users between in-cell sectors and also out-of-cell sectors in moderately loaded networks. It is then shown that by employing overlapping sectors in FOSAA, we can exploit the flexibility of assigning a user to one of possibly many potential antenna to effectively support the non-uniform angular traffic. It is also proven that the problem of selecting a set of antenna from a pool of overlapping antenna and assigning the users to them in FOSAA with minimum MTP is a special case of a general problem that was solved by Hanly (1995) and Yates (1995). The process of dynamic cell sectoring is differentiated two-fold as cell-breathing (CB) and cell-slicing (CS) and the latter can be viewed as azimuthal counterpart of the former radial scheme. The hybrid scheme, CB+CS, is shown to yield the optimal solution in minimum total MTP in a CDMA/FOSAA system. The performance results for the total MTP and the received signal quality are reported. As the congestion level increases, the difference in SIR performance between CB and CS schemes becomes more apparent with the latter outperforming the former. The performance results also show that on average, the CB scheme requires about 30% more power than in CB+CS, when 60% of the mobiles are concentrated in a hot-spot sector in a conventional 3-sector cell."
1169585,21212,8228,Path-Vector Contract Routing,2012,"Many recently proposed clean slate Internet architectures essentially depend on more flexible and extended representation of Internet topology on which next generation routing protocols may operate. Representation of neighboring relationships between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in finer granularity is promising to overcome many shortcomings of the current Internet architecture. Similarly, contract-switching paradigm promotes an ISP to define itself as a set of edge-to-edge (g2g) links that connect ingress and egress routers of its domain. Each link is represented by a contract which defines not only neighboring relationships with other domains but also economic (e.g., price), performance (e.g., quality of service parameters) and temporal (e.g., lifetime of the dedicated link) attributes attached to this g2g link. In this work, we introduce Path-Vector Contract Routing (PVCR) protocol which allows multi-metric, multi-hop negotiation of end-to-end inter-domain paths by leveraging path-vector style construction on top of g2g contract definitions. Our analysis on synthetic and real-world topologies show that Path-Vector Contract Routing has many promising properties such as rich route diversity, end-to-end multi-domain QoS and low control traffic. We also investigate inter-domain traffic engineering capabilities of PVCR which inherently considers economics of routing in its opportunistic settings."
2056815,21212,8228,Contention-Based Prioritized Opportunistic Medium Access Control in Wireless LANs,2006,"In wireless environments, the inherent time-varying characteristics of the channel pose great challenges on medium access control design. In recent years, multiuser diversity and opportunistic medium access control schemes have been proposed to deal with the channel variation in order to efficiently improve the network throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol called Contention-Based Prioritized Opportunistic (CBPO) Medium Access Control Protocol. This protocol takes advantage of multiuser diversity, rate adaptation, which utilizes the multi-rate capability offered by IEEE 802.11, and black-burst (BB) contention to access the shared medium in a distributed manner. In particular, rather than simply measuring the channel condition for a node pair in communications each time, with the help of multicast RTS, the candidate users with qualified channel condition are selected and prioritized. Then the qualified receivers contend to send back prioritized clear-to-send message (CTS) with BB, which is a pulse of energy, the duration of which is proportional to the CTS priority. The user with the best channel quality is always selected to send back CTS and receive packets from the sender. Extensive simulation results show that our protocol achieves much better performance than IEEE 802.11 and other auto rate schemes with minimal additional overhead."

Assuming that the sensor data is sparse in some basis, we show that the recovery of the signal can be formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem. To model the scenario where sensors operate with intermittently available energy that is harvested from the environment, we propose that each sensor transmits independently with some probability, and adapts the transmit power to its harvested energy. Due to the probabilistic transmissions, the elements of the equivalent sensing matrix are not Gaussian. Besides, since the sensors have different energy harvesting rates and different sensor-to-FC distances, the FC has different receive signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for each sensor, referred to as the inhomogeneity of SNRs. Thus, the elements of the sensing matrix are also not identically distributed. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of measurements for reliable reconstruction, by showing that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), under some mild conditions. We then compute an achievable system delay under an allowable mean-squared-error (MSE). Furthermore, using techniques from large deviations theory, we analyze the impact of inhomogeneity of the SNRs on the so-called k-restricted eigenvalues, which governs the number of measurements required for the RIP to hold. Our analysis is corroborated by numerical results."
676411,21212,8228,A collision resolution paradigm for random access channel control in multi-access wireless networks,2002,"The random access channel (RACH) incurs a collision if more than one user make signaling requests over the same time slot, spreading code, or antenna element, in TDMA, CDMA, or SDMA wireless networks, respectively. We propose a hexanary-feedback collision resolution paradigm (HFCRP), capable of leveraging access efficiency of the RACH for all above wireless networks. HFCRP performs incremental contention resolution, managing a small subset of users at a time via a two-phase process. In the first phase, a group of users is probabilistically admitted, with a negligible probability of the group size greater than five. In the second phase, all users in the group are efficiently resolved. The two-phase process is augmented with hexanary feedback control facilitated by an envelope-PDF-based multi-user estimator (MR) implemented at the physical layer. Significantly, the MR measures the exact number of transmitting users (zero to five) in a contention slot by matching the envelope PDFs histograms of received signals to a library of pre-constructed PDFs. These six outcomes comprise the hexanary feedback being broadcast to users during the real-time operation of the two-phase process. Analytic and simulation results delineate that, performing in conjunction with the MR, HFCRP achieves high performance with respect to maximum stable throughput, saturated throughput, access delay, and blocking probability."
2542231,21212,8228,Utility-Based User Grouping and Bandwidth Allocation for Wireless Multicast Systems,2009,"With the proliferation of wireless multimedia applications, multicast/broadcast has been recognized as an efficient technique to transmit a large volume of data to multiple mobile stations at the same time. In most multicast systems, the transmitter (e.g. base station) adapts its data rate to the furthest located users, so as to guarantee service quality to as many users as possible. Predictably, the more users in a multicast group, the lower data rate the base station can transmit. On the other hand, grouping more users together leads to a more efficient utilization of spectrum bandwidth, as these users are served simultaneously. This bring the interesting problem that presses for solution: how to group users in a cell into multicast groups and how to allocate a fixed amount of bandwidth resource to the groups, to achieve a good balance between throughput and fairness in multicast systems. In this paper, we formulate the united user grouping and bandwidth allocation strategy into a utility-based optimization problem. One method of signomial programming is used to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results will show that this suboptimal algorithm performs well even compared to the optimal one. Moreover, through theoretical analysis, we prove that the best user grouping and bandwidth allocation scheme of throughput maximization is to allocate the entire bandwidth to the unique group containing the users located within a ring-shaped region with an optimal outer radius r*."
2519277,21212,8228,Divergence detection in a speech-excited in-service non-intrusive measurement device,2000,"This paper proposes new divergence detection techniques for implementation within in-service non-intrusive measurement devices (INMDs) in public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). The in-service non-intrusive measurement system of interest is used to monitor the delivered quality of speech (QoS) by monitoring the echoes in the telephony network. INMDs are usually based on a class of least mean square (LMS) digital adaptive filters (DAFs). The performance criterion is defined by the modelling convergence rate derived from the optimal Wiener weights, and the excitation for the DAFs is conversational speech. Four types of divergence detectors (DD) are proposed. These are energy divergence detectors (EDD), log energy divergence detectors (LDD), zero crossing divergence detectors (ZDD) and autocorrelation coefficient divergence detectors (ADD). The proposed DDs are based on the detection of voiced/unvoiced/silence periods and as such act as pattern classifiers. Experimental observations have shown that divergence occurs during the low energy unvoiced segments in high-noise environments. The tap-weight coefficients of the DAF are updated with the new value during the voiced segment while the update of the tap-weight coefficients during unvoiced segments of the speech is frozen. This result is then compared with the perfect divergence detector, which employs the Wiener weight theory. The DD techniques reported produce a significant improvement in the system's performance in a noise-impaired environment. Over one second adaptation (8000 samples) the energy divergence detector, the log energy divergence detector, the autocorrelation divergence detector and the zero crossing divergence detector gave model improvements of 16.93 dB, 15.81 db, 12.48 dB and 11.62 dB respectively at echo to noise ratio (e/N) of 0 dB. The proposed DDs compare well with the ideal (nonimplementable) Wiener DD which gives an improvement of 20.92 dB."
2272152,21212,8228,A novel flow control scheme for improving TCP fairness and throughput over heterogeneous networks with wired and wireless links,2005,"Most of the recent research on TCP over heterogeneous networks has concentrated on differentiating between packet drops caused by link congestion versus drops caused by link errors. Handling the two types of packet drop differently avoids significant throughput degradations caused by frequent TCP window shut downs due to non-congestive drops. However, TCP also exhibits inherent unfairness for connections with long round-trip times and connections that traverse multiple congested routers. In heterogeneous networks, the difference in bit error rates between wireless and wired links aggravates the situation even more. In this paper, we propose a new TCP bandwidth allocation (NTBA) algorithm to solve these problems. The primary contribution is a wireless access node algorithm with a simple new shadow price scheme provided by the network node. The advantage of our algorithm is that it simplifies the TCP sender-side implementation and keeps the receiver-side protocol stack unchanged. We propose to apply wireless explicit congestion notification (WECN) to decouple congestion control from loss recovery in wireless networks. Simulation results show that not only can the combined NTBA/WECN mechanism improve TCP fairness, but it can also maintain very good throughput performance in the presence of wireless channel losses."
2726996,21212,8228,On energy-delay efficiency for WBAN: A multi-channel scheme,2015,"Along with the increase of people's urge for health care, e-health, as a term for healthcare practice supported by electronic processes and communication, attracts more and more attentions. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) built on IEEE 802.15.6 is an excellent solution for e-health on account of its medical applications. Extensive researches of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol in WBAN put emphasis on single channel. This may result in inevitable interference and bring channel collision and energy inefficiency. In addition, traditional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CS-MA/CA) utilized in single channel results in the large packet delay and energy consumption for overhearing. This cannot meet the request of medical data communication. To address these issues, we propose an energy-delay efficient multi-channel MAC (ED-MAC) protocol. In our scheme, (i) the channels are classified into control channel and data ones; (ii) nodes contend to reserve data channels in control channel while transmit data frames through the specified data channels; (iii) the value of Contention Window (CW) in CSMA/CA is adjusted to accommodate the ED-MAC protocol better. Simulation results show that our ED-MAC scheme significantly decreases the packet delay and improves the throughput, channel utilization and energy efficiency."
2449086,21212,8228,Exploiting the Operating Point in Sensing-Based Opportunistic Spectrum Access Scenarios,2009,"Spectrum sensing is one key enabler towards opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. Such scenarios allow cognitive users (a.k.a. secondary users) to access some licensed spectrum band as long as they do not interfere with the licensed (or primary) users. The main goal is to achieve an efficient and utmost access to the otherwise underutilized spectrum resources while still guaranteeing primary users a non-harmful operation. Spectrum sensing can be then used by secondary users to detect spectrum holes that may be accessed in a non-interfering manner. However, spectrum sensing may be subject to errors in the form of false-alarm and misdetection. False-alarm causes spectrum under-use while misdetection leads to spectrum interference between primary and secondary users. Unfortunately, these two magnitudes pose a trade-off on the sensing mechanism: low misdetection is achieved at the expense of high false alarm and vice versa. Consequently, an adequate operating point of the sensing mechanism should be determined. In this work we evaluate the impact of false-alarm and misdetection errors on the performance of a spectrum sensing scenario.We use a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model and we determine the suitable operating point for the sensing mechanism under different traffic load conditions such that some Quality of Service is attained by both primary and secondary users. Performance results reveal that by effectively choosing the operation point bearing in mind the traffic load levels will lead to enhanced perceived quality of service of both primary and secondary users."
1116241,21212,8228,Creating intelligent environments to monitor and manipulate physical activity and sedentary behavior in public health and clinical settings,2012,"It is generally agreed, that an active lifestyle promotes healthy living across different age groups. It helps to combat obesity, reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease, and support independent living as we age. However, it is difficult to quantify a direct correlation between physical activity and health outcomes. Given that obesity and lifestyle-related illnesses occur over years in contrast to days, weeks or months seeing the effects activity and sedentary behaviour has on individuals in the short term is not always possible. The ubiquitous nature of physical activity makes it extremely difficult to capture as people go about their lives. Consequently, there has been a great deal of debate on the frequency intensity time, and the type of physical activity required by different groups (pre-schoolers, children, adults, older adults, obese, infirm, disabled, and depressed). There is a need to provide effective mechanisms to monitor and manipulate physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Whilst several commercially available products exist to achieve this, compliance is poor. The challenge is to use new and novel technologies that are unobtrusive and natural adjunct to a persons day-to-day activity. This paper builds on existing ideas and explores how activity and sedentary behaviour information can be collected from different environments. We have developed an initial working prototype to evaluate the applicability of our approach."
283565,21212,8228,Space-time coding and optimal scrambling for mode multiplexed optical fiber systems,2015,"Approaching the capacity limits of single-mode fiber based optical transmission systems, new fibers supporting the propagation of up to six orthogonal spatial modes, called few-mode fibers, stand as promising candidates for future high-capacity systems. Extensive research is being carried out to further increase the number of modes to multiplex more data. This technique is known as spatial division multiplexing (SDM). However, the co-existence of modes in the same space leads to inevitable modal crosstalk that may induce a loss of their orthogonality as well as power disparities. This phenomenon is called mode dependent loss (MDL) and mainly arises from optical components such as few-mode amplifiers. Although optical solutions were suggested to reduce MDL by inserting mode scramblers or using fibers with strong modal coupling, MDL was unfortunately not completely removed. In this work, we propose a DSP solution based on Space-Time (ST) coding along with OFDM, originally designed for multi-antenna channels, to mitigate MDL in SDM systems. We show that a combination of ST coding at the transmitter and an optimal distribution of mode scramblers in the optical link can completely absorb the penalties induced by important levels of MDL in 6-mode SDM systems. Later on, we address the complexity and scalability of the ST-coding solution and propose a sub-optimal decoding scheme that keeps the MDL-induced penalty low while considerably reducing the decoding complexity."
534397,21212,8228,Asymptotic SEP analysis for optimally precoded large MIMO channels with ZF detection,2015,"This paper considers the asymptotic analysis of symbol error probability (SEP) for either optimally precoded or uniformly precoded large correlated MIMO fading channels using the zero-forcing (ZF) detector. For such systems, we reveal some very nice structures which naturally lead us to the exploration of two very strong and very useful mathematical tools for the systematic study of asymptotic behaviors on their error performance. The first tool is the Szego's theorem on large Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and the second tool is the well known limit: lim x→∞ (1 + 1/x) x  = e. This new approach enables us to attain a very simple expression for the SEP limit as the number of the transmitter antennas goes to infinity. One of the major advantages for this method is that its convergence rate is very fast. Hence, this expression is very efficient and effective SEP approximation for the large MIMO systems. Due to the constraint on allowable space and limited (sparse) multi-path scattering, fading correlation between neighbouring antenna elements is almost inevitable in a large MIMO architecture. By specifically examining an exponential correlation matrix model, we show that channel fading correlation can lead to significant performance loss. The optimal precoding technique can yield substantial power gain over the uniform power allocation strategy."
2091843,21212,8228,Time Sharing Policy in Wireless Networks for Variable Rate Transmission,2007,"For most of wireless services with variable rate transmission, both average rate and rate oscillation are important performance metrics. One often needs to decide how much rate oscillation the service can tolerate to obtain a higher average rate. Service satisfaction for each user is quantified by an increasing and concave utility function of instantaneous transmission rate. It is capable of facilitating the resource allocation with flexible combinations of average rate and rate oscillation. Particularly, we are interested in maximizing the time-average aggregate utility by scheduling user transmissions in a time-shared wireless network. A resource allocation policy is developed, namely, time sharing (TS), to exploit the concavity of utility function and the fluctuation of channel gain. This is formulated as a constrained convex optimization problem. Our analysis shows that in the TS policy the optimal scheduler allows multiple users with relatively better channel conditions to share a same time frame in an adaptive time-division manner. In addition, the more concave the utility function is, the higher the probability of time frame sharing is. An extension to quantized time sharing with limited channel feedback (QTSL) for practical systems is all studied. Simulation results show that, two to three bits of channel state information (CSI) are sufficient for the performance of QTSL scheme to approach that of the optimal TS policy when the number of time slots in a time frame is not less than the number of users, especially, in high SNR region."
663896,21212,8228,Hybrid multimedia-on-demand systems,2001,"As broadband networks keep increasing in transmission speed, multimedia-on-demand (MOD) is expected to be one of the most popular broadband services in the near future. MOD systems can provide two types of services: interactive service and batch service. The interactive service provides each user with one dedicated stream. With it, the user can use the VCR function controls such as pause, forward and rewind. However, the service is expensive and not scalable to the system size. With the batch service, the users who request the same multimedia content within a batch period will be grouped together and served by one dedicated stream. Hence, the system can either use fewer resources or serve more customers. However, batch users must wait for programs to begin and are unable to perform VCR function control. We take advantage of both services by considering an MOD system that provides both services. Also, we propose two methods to optimize their coexistence. In addition, an analytical model is derived for performance evaluation. Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid system really outperforms both individual systems. The hybrid system provides a superior solution to both the service providers and the users. Specifically, given a limited storage resource, the service provider receives more revenue by serving more users concurrently, while the users have a satisfactory viewing experience due to higher availability of programs and the low average waiting time."
2114005,21212,8228,Cooperation in Wireless Sensor Networks: Design and Performance Analysis of a MAC Protocol,2008,"Cooperative communications is one of the promising techniques to enhance the performance of wireless networks. The extent of performance improvement needs to be carefully investigated, especially for wireless sensor networks, due to the overhead and energy costs involved with cooperation and the dependency on energy consumption models. In this paper, we propose a cooperative medium access control protocol, COMAC that enables cooperation in a realistic scenario using 802.11g based radios and leverages cooperative communications by making use of the overheard packets from neighboring nodes of a sender node. In an effort to determine the conditions under which cooperation is preferable, we evaluate COMAC's performance in comparison with standard 802.11 through detailed simulations, considering different physical layer data rates, varying transmission ranges, networks of different sizes and various energy consumption models. COMAC is shown to provide robustness to the wireless channel impairments, resulting in increased transmission range and improved packet success ratio in point-to- point scenarios. Throughput and energy efficiency performance is also quantified for multi-point-to-point scenarios with varying number of contending nodes. It is shown that cooperation with COMAC can provide significant enhancement in throughput, up to 23 times non-cooperative 802.11, together with energy savings of 50% even for high circuit energy consumption cases."
2269660,21212,8228,Leveraging IP signaling and routing to manage UPSR-based transport networks,2003,"An important requirement in the IP-based control of TDM optical transport networks is to utilize the built-in protection capabilities of SONET unidirectional path switched rings (UPSRs) and automate UPSR protected path setup in mixed mesh-ring networks. This requires modifications to existing IP signaling and routing protocol and new processing rules at the network nodes. In this paper, we leverage IP routing and signaling, and MPLS fast-reroute techniques to accurately advertise UPSR ring topologies and dynamically establish UPSR protected paths across a transport network. Our proposal also makes a NUT-like (non-preemptable unprotected traffic) feature possible in UPSRs, which allows for efficient utilization of UPSR protection bandwidth. We achieve this by encoding UPSR-specific information in the open shortest path first (OSPF) link state advertisement and in signaling messages of the resource reservation protocol (RSVP) with TE extensions. In addition, we modify the signaling and routing state machines at the nodes to interpret and process this information to perform UPSR topology discovery and path computation. The uniqueness of our proposals is that the algorithms and the rules specified in the paper allow for existing IP-based protocols (such as those within the GMPLS framework, which currently applies to mesh networks) to be efficiently adapted for this context, while still achieving our objective of exploiting UPSR protection capabilities."
1265282,21212,8228,Distributed interference-aware admission control with soft resource allocation for hybrid MAC in wireless mesh networks,2012,"Supporting quality of service (QoS) while fulfilling high efficiency of bandwidth utilization is challenging in wireless mesh networks. To deal with this issue, hybrid medium access control (MAC) protocols are effective candidates because they can achieve QoS support and better resource sharing at the same time. However, in multi-hop communication environments, hybrid MAC protocols suffer from interference and low bandwidth efficiency. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a distributed interference-aware admission control algorithm (DIACA) with soft resource allocation for hybrid MAC protocols suitable for IEEE 802.11 wireless mesh networks; a scheme for providing QoS improvement for real-time sessions (RTSNs) while enhancing the efficiency of bandwidth utilization. The proposed DIACA possesses a function for interference probing, making each node recognize their interfering counterparts. Further, through support of interference detection, concurrent transmissions can be achieved by letting non-interfering nodes transmit data simultaneously along a route which improves the efficiency of spatial reuse of bandwidth. In addition, the DIACA can implement soft resource allocation for RTSNs having delay requirements but loose (or low) throughput demands. By using soft resource allocation, a transmission opportunity can be shared by different RTSNs with low data rates and each of the RTSNs can obtain satisfactory QoS. Simulation results indicate that the proposed admission control algorithm can significantly enhance the bandwidth utilization of wireless channel and can improve QoS for RTSNs."
1471214,21212,8839,MuVi: a multicast video delivery scheme for 4g cellular networks,2012,"Although wireless broadband technologies have evolved significantly over the past decade, they are still insufficient to support the fast-growing mobile traffic, especially due to the increasing popularity of mobile video applications. Wireless multicast, aiming to exploit the wireless broadcast advantage, is a viable approach to bridge the gap between the limited wireless networking capacity and the ever-increasing mobile video traffic demand. In this work, we propose MuVi, a Multicast Video delivery scheme in OFDMA-based 4G wireless networks, to optimize multicast video traffic. MuVi differentiates video frames based on their importance in reconstructing the video and incorporates an efficient radio resource allocation algorithm to optimize the overall video quality across all users in the multicast group. MuVi is a lightweight solution with most of the implementation in the gateway, slight modification in the base-station, and no modification at the clients. We implement MuVi on a WiMAX testbed and compare its performance to a Naive wireless multicast scheme that employs the most robust MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme), and an Adaptive scheme that employs the highest MCS supportable by all clients. Experimental results show that MuVi improves the average video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) by up to 13 and 7 dB compared to the Naive and the Adaptive schemes, respectively. MuVi does not require modification to the video encoding scheme or the air interface. Thus it allows speedy deployment in existing systems."
1357178,21212,8228,ProTOMAC: Proactive Transmit Opportunity Detection at the MAC Layer for Cognitive Radios,2010,"Traditional Cognitive Radio Networks aim to utilize the radio spectrum white space. We present a radically different approach which exploits the excess Signal-to-Noise ratios at which the primary network nodes operate. This paper introduces ProTOMAC (Proactive Transmit Opportunity Detection at MAC Layer), the first spectrum access paradigm that leverages the gray space present at the MAC layer via a novel conceptual extension of the Interference Temperature (IT) approach. The ProTOMAC architecture is based on detecting changes in the primary network packet statistics. Specifically, we develop novel techniques based on iteratively updated information theoretic divergence measures along with rapid and accurate kernel density estimators. These enable the secondary network to operate subject to an interference constraint that ensures a given primary network QOS. ProTOMAC presents a generalized scheme for coexistence of dissimilar Packet Based Networks. We provide an efficient implementation of ProTOMAC using commercial off-the-shelf equipment. The coexistence efficacy of ProTOMAC is validated on an IEEE 802.11g WLAN via establishing a 500 kbps secondary link with a range of 3 meters with an early interference detection time of 240-600 ms. For the first time, identification and exploitation of hitherto unutilized transmission opportunities in Packet Based Networks has been made possible."
2232126,21212,8228,Performance evaluation of a real-time transport protocol with deterministic and statistical QoS guarantees,1997,"In this paper, we study the performance of a real-time transport protocol in an interactive multimedia data network. Access multiplexers, which support groups of users, and digital media servers (MS) are interconnected by a star-topology asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual path crossconnect (VPX) network. The network traffic is generated by data retrieval requests from data on demand (DOD) and video on demand (VOD) users. Typical DOD applications are interactive games, interactive home shopping, etc. Some VOD (like a start up) and all DOD data transfers are caused by user action. Transmissions of information packets from MSs to users are scheduled by the multitoken exchange (MTEX) protocol which represents a deadline priority on-the-fly virtual path rereservation scheme. Statistically guaranteed quality of service (QoS) is assigned to all data transmissions caused by user actions, while deterministic performance requirements are imposed to ensure the integrity of video signals. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated in terms of meeting the deterministic and statistical QoS requirements by means of the probability of missing the data delivery deadline and the average response time correspondingly. We show that the attainable statistical multiplexing gain depends on the number of active VOD users and on a number of other traffic related parameters."
2087730,21212,8228,Strategies for distributed QoS support in radio spectrum sharing,2005,"Spectrum sharing in unlicensed bands is expected to become an increasingly significant research problem. With the proliferation of IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks, and with other future radio systems using the unlicensed bands, spectral coexistence of dissimilar radio systems will have to be addressed. Coexistence can be achieved with the help of spectrum etiquette, or alternatively by implementing new communication protocols and defining common spectrum coordination channels. We investigate how two independent wireless networks may share spectrum without direct coordination and information exchange. We start by illustrating our previously introduced stage-based game model of such scenarios. The application of game models allows us to analyze the problem as a player competition; within radio resource sharing games, payoff-maximizing players represent wireless networks. Decisions that players repeatedly have to make are about when, and how often, to attempt medium access. We use an established notation to describe multi-stage strategies that determine a player's decision-making. Should radio networks cooperate or should competing radio networks ignore the presence of other radio networks? What is the expected outcome in a repeated interaction? The paper shows that traffic requirements imposed by services and applications determine the selected strategies, which pursue cooperation or ignore other radio systems."

A (EV-DOrA) standard for wireless link transmission. We present a comprehensive, bottom up analysis of signaling delay for setting up multimedia sessions and we evaluate system architecture alternatives to reduce it. Call setup time is particularly critical for interactive applications, such as gaming, push-to-X and Voice over IP (VoIP), where user experience of time that takes to start or join a session directly translates in user perception of service quality. Our analysis takes into account a large set of system design parameters across all layers, ranging from radio link properties to IMS processing and specific characteristics of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). For an example signaling flow between two mobile users, we derive an important set of numerical results for call set up time under various IMS design scenarios that consider effects of SIP compression efficiency, choice of transport protocols (TCP, UDP) and radio link quality. Based on the results obtained, we propose and discuss new methods to improve the signaling efficiency and to reduce the call setup time."

Among those, Wireless Body Sensors (WBS) for cardiac monitoring are of prominent help to early detect CardioVascular Diseases (CVD) by analyzing 24/24 and 7/7 collected cardiac data. Today, most of these WBS systems for CVD detection, include only limited automatic anomalies detection, particularly regarding ECG anomalies. Severe CVD, such as Myocardial Infarction or Ischemia, needs to achieve an advanced analysis of ECG waves known as P, Q, R, S and T. In particular, the T-wave and its specific changes. In this paper, we focus on T-wave anomalies detection in a context of WBS. Our study suggests an accurate and lightweight T-wave changes detection model which suits well an ECG monitoring system based on WBS architecture. We performed a comparative study of 7 well-known supervised learning classification models, on real ECG data sets from 7 different leads. We compared the results from both perspectives of classification and processing times. Our results show that the C4.5 Decision Tree technique performs better results with 92.54% Accuracy, 96.06% Sensibility, 55.41% Specificity and 7.41% Error Rate."
2181654,21212,8228,Adaptive Pre-Compensation of Transmitter Phase Noise for User Coexistence in Cognitive Radios,2011,"Secondary wide-band users have to guarantee they will not disturb the in-band narrow-band primary licensed users. There are techniques proposed to limit the interference by secondary wide-band users in the specified in-band narrow bands. Active Interference Cancelation (AIC) can flexibly solve this problem in the digital domain and hence remove the need for extra expensive analog hardware. The main challenge is the degradation in the final depth of a nulled band by radio impairments such as PA non-linearity, phase noise, and I/Q imbalance. In this paper, we analyze the effect of phase noise on the performance of active interference cancelation techniques and then propose a mitigation technique. Our analysis shows that phase noise can degrade the nulling depth performance by 11.4-19.6dB at the edge of nulled band. We propose an adaptive pre-filtering technique to improve the nulling performance by ~3-11dB depending on system configuration. The proposed scheme utilizes the existing analog-to-digital converter in the device's receiver path for providing feedback when in transmit mode. This can leads to higher power consumption in transmit mode due to this additional analog-to-digital conversion in the feedback path. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive tracking filter with low duty-cycle on/off periods. We show that sacrificing 0.5dB in the null-depth can reduce the ADC power consumption by 95%."
2035597,21212,8228,Study of Best-Effort VoIP Handovers between WLAN and EVDO Networks,2007,"The IEEE 802.11 based Wireless LANs (WLANs) have emerged as a viable technology for supporting real-time applications such as voice over IP (VoIP). Even the personal digital assistants and Smartphones are being equipped with WLAN, leading such devices to operate in dual-mode with the WLAN and WAN (wide area network) radios capable of supporting IP communication. This development enables applications such as VoIP to roam or handover freely across the two networks. Seamless handover of VoIP between such networks poses two challenges: the call must persist in spite of mobility across networks, and the LAN and WAN must support the delay and packet loss requirement bounds for VoIP calls. In this paper, we present an experimental study of best-effort VoIP handovers across WLAN and the CDMA EVDO networks, using Skype as the VoIP application. The objectives of our study were: to understand and evaluate the mobility events and actions taking place in a handover; to evaluate the feasibility of running VoIP over WLAN and CDMA EVDO in the process of understanding mobility; and to provide insight into further research in this area. Our study shows that EVDO link acquisition latency and downlink scheduling, and IP mobility procedures contribute towards VoIP call failures. These results provide crucial input to the design of best-effort real-time applications as well as mobility protocols."
1865814,21212,8228,A QoS packet/burst scheduler for broadband networks,2002,"Prevailing weight-based scheduling algorithms advocate static or coarse-grained simplification of timestamp computation, resulting in performance bottlenecks and unnecessary downgrades under heavy and normal computation loads, respectively. Our goal is to design a scheduler that enables quantitative trade-off balance between performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a stepwise QoS scheduler (SQS), enabling packet to burst scheduling under normal to heavy computation loads, based on a new notion of window. Window sizes of unity and greater than one correspond to packet and burst scheduling, respectively. SQS exerts simple FIFO service within the window and guarantees stepwise weight-proportional service at the window boundary. As a result, quantitative trade-off balance can be facilitated via the adjustment of the window size. We further formally specify the SQS service guarantee for a flow by a stepwise service curve, which is a function of W and /spl theta//sub min/-the least-upper-bound delay incurred by the first packet of the busy period of the flow. Finally, we demonstrate through experimental results that, by applying a small window (W/spl les/10), SQS outperforms weighted fair queueing (WFQ) and performs as superior as worst-case fair weighted fair queueing (WF/sup 2/Q) with respect to throughput fairness, mean delay, and worst-case delay fairness."
2459710,21212,8228,A Distributed Approach to End-to-End Network Topology Inference,2007,"To construct an efficient overlay network, the information of underlay is important. However, the inference of an underlay topology is not easy. We consider using end-to-end measurement tools such as traceroute to infer the underlay topology among a group of hosts. Since pair-wise traceroutes among hosts take a long time and generate much network traffic, Max-Delta has been proposed to infer a highly accurate topology with a low number of traceroutes. However, Max-Delta relies on a central server to collect traceroute results and to select paths for hosts to measure. It is hence not scalable to large groups. In this paper, we investigate a distributed version of Max-Delta scheme in order to support scalable inference. In our scheme, each host joins an overlay tree before conducting traceroutes. A host then independently selects paths to traceroute and exchanges traceroute results with others through the overlay tree. As a result, each host can maintain a partially discovered topology. We have studied two key issues in the scheme, i.e., how to construct a low-diameter overlay tree and how to reduce bandwidth consumption in measurements. As compared to Max-Delta, our scheme is fully distributed and scalable. In the scheme, each host computes its own traceroute targets, and the computational loads are distributed to all the hosts instead of a single server. Furthermore, each host only exchanges data with a few other hosts and does not need to set up connections with all the other hosts. Simulation results show that the constructed tree has a low diameter and can support quick data exchange among hosts, and that the use of a lookup table for routers can significantly reduce bandwidth consumption in data exchange."
1631922,21212,8228,Exact analytical solution for AF relaying systems with full selection diversity,2012,"New, exact closed-form expressions are derived for the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems with “full” selection diversity. The direct path, from the source to the destination, as well as multiple dual-hop paths, through intermediate relays, are considered in the selection set. The selection process follows a maximum SNR policy, such that the path of the maximum end-to-end SNR is used as the communication link, whether this path is the direct path or one of the dual-hop paths. The derived expressions are used to obtain the first exact results for the average error probability and the outage probability of such AF relaying systems. The results are verified through simulations for identically distributed as well as non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading links. The system performance is compared to that of conventional wireless systems which use only the direct link between the source and the destination for communication. The system performance is compared also to that of an opportunistic dual-hop AF system with maximum end-to-end SNR relay selection that excludes the direct path from the selection set. Results show that the full selection system performance is superior to those in the comparison. For example, in the case of Nakagami-m fading links with m = 4 and N = 2 candidate intermediate relays, an average error probability of 2×10 -4  in the case of AF relaying with full selection, occurs at 4.06 dB less than it occurs in the case of only direct transmission and at 0.95 dB less than it occurs in the case of maximum end-to-end SNR relay selection that excludes the direct path from selection. Results show also that the system provides diversity gain, proportional to the selection set size, N +1."
2720572,21212,8228,Hybrid analog-digital beam training for mmWave systems with low-resolution RF phase shifters,2016,"Millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless technologies are expected to exploit large-scale multiple-input multiple-output and adaptive antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver to deal with unfavorable radio propagation and realize sufficient link margin. However, the high cost and power consumption of mmWave radio components prohibit the use of fully-digital precoding/combining architectures, which incurs one dedicated RF chain per antenna element. This paper proposes a practical design of multi-beamwidth codebook exploiting hybrid analogdigital architectures with a number of RF chains much lower than the number of antenna elements and 2-bit RF phase shifters. The proposed solution relies on the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm enhanced by a dynamic dictionary learning mechanism. Simulation results show that the designed hybrid codebooks are able to shape beam patterns very close to those attained by a fully-digital beamforming architecture. Furthermore, when leveraged in the framework of an adaptive, multiresolution beam training protocol, our hybrid codebooks are able to estimate the most promising angle-of-departure and angle-of-arrival directions with extreme accuracy, yet requiring lower complexity hardware compared to the state of art."
1981727,21212,8228,Quality of Experience Measurement Tool for SVC Video Coding,2011,"The scalable extension of H.264, known as Scalable Video Coding (SVC), is recently finalized and adapted by the Joint Video Team. Scalability is achieved in the temporal, spatial, quality (SNR), or any combination of those domains. One example of using video scalability is in saving bandwidth when the same media content is required to be sent simultaneously at different resolutions to support heterogeneous devices and networks. Meanwhile, Quality of Experience (QoE) is the key criteria for evaluating the video service such as SVC. Unlike QoS metrics (such as bandwidth, delay, jitters, etc.), QoE is more accurate to reflect the user experience as it considers Human Visual System and its complex behavior towards distortions in the displayed video sequence. In order to evaluate QoE, objective assessment tools may not correlate well with the human perceived video quality and at same time, subjective quality assessment methods are costly and time consuming. In this paper, we design an automatic QoE monitoring tool for SVC video coding mechanism. The module is based on PSQA (Pseudo Subjective Quality Assessment tool), which is a hybrid (objective/subjective) assessment tool. PSQA uses RNN (Random Neural Network) to capture the non-linear relation between the video coding as well as network parameters affecting the video quality, and QoE. The results show clearly that our module can accurately estimate QoE for SVC video streams."
1952325,21212,8228,Variable-rate variable-power M-FSK scheme for power limited systems,2003,"The first two authors have proposed a variable-rate and fixed-power (VRFP) non-coherent M-ary frequency shift keying (M-FSK) scheme for power limited systems [F.F. Digham and M.S. Alouini (September 2002)], [F.F. Digham and M.S. Alouini (November 2002]. In this paper, we propose a variable-rate and variable-power (VRVP) scheme which offers some additional power saving. In this scheme, we impose the power assignment function as a design variable to minimize the objective function which is the average transmitted power while meeting the average spectral efficiency and bit error rate (BER) constraints. The power allocation mechanism is executed based on the channel gain feedback estimates. Our results show that the proposed system provides power saving varying from roughly 2.3 up to 5 dB. Moreover, the power loading function exhibits two interesting features. The first is that its peak is always less than the fixed amount of power used to guarantee the same system performance. The second is the self control type of behavior in which the peak occurs at a moderate value of channel gain while it tends to allocate less power at both high and low values of channel gain. We further investigate the problem with an additional maximum power constraint. In this case, we obtain a modified power loading function which can still fulfil the rate constraint up to a certain limit after which there is a rate maximum-power tradeoff."
2813182,21212,8228,Pricing the fast-lanes: A qualitative study on the implications of paid peering agreements,2016,"Paid peering is controversial. Generally speaking, large access ISPs favour it, while Content Providers (CPs) do not. But is CP opposition to paid peering irrational, especially if their transferred payments can incentivize the ISP to make greater investment in the common infrastructure? To answer this question we analyze an ecosystem consisting of a single access ISP that directly interconnects with multiple CPs, doing so in two extreme situations: when paid peering is used for all the involved CPs, and when all parties agree on a settlement-free deal. We analyse the equilibrium, finding the total amount of investments and profits of the various stakeholders, when their revenues are affected by the total investment in infrastructure and the charges that result from the different agreements. Interestingly, it turns out whether or not there is benefit to a CP, depends on whether its business model is to sell content, and so it can recover part of the paid peering charge by raising prices to its customers, or if the CP obtains its revenue from ads. It also depends on the volume (in traffic units) per customer transaction, since we find that CPs with high volume per transaction will be charged less per byte, and so will contribute proportionally less to the total paid peering revenue that subsidizes the common ISP infrastructure. We also find a crucial role for the end-users' evaluation of the level of investments of the various market players. Another relevant factor is the access price that an ISP charges its customers."
1548104,21212,8228,Spectrum Sharing between Cooperative Relay and Ad-Hoc Networks: Dynamic Transmissions under Computation and Signaling Limitations,2011,"This paper studies a spectrum sharing scenario between an uplink cognitive relay network (CRN) and some nearby low power ad-hoc networks. In particular, the dynamic resource allocation of the CRN is analyzed, which aims to minimize the average interfering time with the ad-hoc networks subject to a minimal average uplink throughput constraint. A long term average rate formula is considered, which is achieved by a half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay strategy with multi-channel transmissions. Both the source and relay are allowed to queue their data, by which they can adjust the transmission rates flexibly based on sensing and predicting the channel state and ad-hoc traffic. The dynamic resource allocation of the CRN is formulated as a non-convex stochastic optimization problem. By carefully analyzing the optimal transmission time scheduling, it is reduced to a stochastic convex optimization problem and solved by the dual optimization method. The signaling and computation processes are designed carefully to reduce the computations at the source (mobile terminal, MT). The time delay between spectrum sensing and the transmission period is quite short to guarantee the accuracy of ad-hoc traffic prediction. The key idea to achieve these benefits is making use of the analytical structure of the optimal solution. Numerical results are presented to show the benefits of our spectrum sharing strategy."
388192,21212,8228,Traffic flow modeling and limitation on the coexistence of WAVE and WLAN,2015,"Traffic flow modeling is important to the performance analysis/evaluation of services provided by Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANET), and is also a useful guidance to the deployment of VANET. Different from prior work based on empirical data collected decades ago, in this work, we collect a large amount of empirical traffic flow data from five typical overhead road segments during two different time periods recently in Shanghai. Statistical results in a short time scale (i.e., within half an hour) show that the lane-level traffic volumes/vehicles' velocities in the monitored road segments followed truncated Gaussian distribution (with a match rate of roughly 90%) better than Poisson distribution (with a match rate of roughly 80%) which is normally assumed in the literature. Traffic flow characteristic in a long time scale (i.e., in a day or a week) is also presented, which shows that the traffic density in the night and daytime are very different, however, the traffic flow density in the daytime stays high. With the obtained traffic flow characteristics, we discuss the possibility of the coexistence of WAVE and WLAN in 5.9G band according to the Federal Communications Commission's intention, and point out that for areas in the vicinity of a overhead road inside Outer Ring road in Shanghai, it is not practical for WLAN devices to operate on 5.9G WAVE band."
1270066,21212,8228,Collecting fusion gains for detection of spread spectrum signals using compressive wideband radios,2013,"In this paper, we investigate the possibility of improving the blind detection performance of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signals for cognitive radios (CRs). We consider a scenario where a wide range of frequency spectrum needs to be monitored by a single CR, and the presence of spread spectrum signals need to be identified reliably in a cost effective manner. We employ compressive sensing to achieve realistic sensing time without imposing excessive sampling-rate requirements on the analog-to-digital converter of the CR. We assume that the number, the center frequencies, and the spreading codes of the DSSS signals are unknown, but only the spread signal's bandwidth is known. We propose a three-step algorithm for the CR. First, the power spectral density (PSD) of the wideband spectrum is estimated using compressed samples, and then detection is performed by thresholding to detect spectrum occupancy based on the estimated PSD. In the third step, knowledge of the spread signal's bandwidth, and the estimated PSD are used to perform fusion by looking at spectrum occupancy at adjacent frequency bins using a sliding window. We present some simulation results illustrating the performance gain in detection achieved by introducing the fusion step. This is a useful result since it allows us to detect with improved performance the presence of multiple DSSS signals distributed over a very wideband spectrum, without requiring the knowledge of each signal's spreading code."
376424,21212,8228,Enhancement of wide bandwidth operation in IEEE 802.11ac networks,2015,"IEEE 802.11 has evolved from 802.11a/b/g/n to 802.11ac in order to meet ever-increasing high throughput demand. The newest standard supports various channel widths up to 160 MHz by bonding multiple 20 MHz channels. In order to efficiently utilize multiple channel widths, 802.11ac defines two operations, namely, dynamic channel access (DCA) and dynamic bandwidth operation (DBO). In this paper, we reveal that the use of DCA improves channel utilization significantly, and DBO not only partly overcomes secondary channel hidden interference problems but also achieves better channel utilization. However, when a transmitter attempts to send an enhanced RTS frame before data transmission as part of DBO, the station has no way to know how much bandwidth will be used, thus leading to malfunction of virtual carrier sensing at neighboring stations. On the other hand, the use of enhanced RTS/CTS without hidden traffic wastes airtime significantly. To address these problems, we first define how to calculate an appropriate value of duration field for enhanced RTS/CTS, and then develop an algorithm which adaptively enables/disables DBO considering the (secondary) hidden interference. Through ns-3 simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves up to 2x higher throughput compared to the baseline of 802.11ac."
1026781,21212,8228,Reconfiguration of virtual network mapping considering service disruption,2013,"Network Virtualization (NV) offers an efficient usage of resource by sharing the infrastructure with different virtual network operators while deploying new services. However, it also raises new challenges for network operators and researchers [1]. One of the main challenges is the efficient resource allocation, known as virtual network (VN) mapping problem. In a dynamic scenario, where VN requests come and leave dynamically, the ability to reallocate the currently-mapped networks allows to enhance the resource utilization. But it also leads to the service disruption of reconfigured virtual networks. In this paper, we study the problem of virtual network reconfiguration taking into account the cost incurred by the disrupted services. Most of the recent research on this topic just focused on the acceptance ratio of the virtual networks but didn't address the possible service disruption during the reconfiguration. This paper proposes a reconfiguration mechanism, which is triggered whenever a new coming virtual network request cannot be mapped on the current network. The mechanism re-allocates the currently-mapped networks to accommodate the new request, provided that the minimized cost of reconfiguration doesn't not exceed the gain from mapping the new request. The approach is mathematically formulated as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that maximizes the net gain of the reconfiguration. Its performance is then evaluated and analysed thoroughly through extensive simulations. Finally, a heuristic is proposed to shorten the solving time of the ILP problem while maintaining its performance."
2080063,21212,8228,Optimized Routing Framework for Intermittently Connected Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,2008,"Due to limited radio transmission range, sporadic node densities and power limitations, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) may become intermittently connected thereby disrupting the data routing process. Existing routing schemes for MANETs are not equipped to address this routing problem. In an attempt to resolve this, various store-carry-forward routing mechanisms have been proposed in literature. Although they exploit the mobility of the nodes for message delivery, most of them only focus on one particular routing factor such as delivery probabilities in particular cases, and cannot work well under various mobility scenarios. Furthermore, application-specific and user-centric service requirements are also not considered in any of these routing approaches. As such, in this paper we present a novel routing framework, AHP-GRA based routing framework (AGRF), that utilizes two mathematical models namely analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and grey relational analysis (GRA) to offer routing capability in intermittently connected MANETs (ICMANs). In the proposed mechanism, when any two nodes meet each other in the network, each node selects the messages it prefers to store, carry and forward in the future by ranking all possible messages according to various preferred factors. Simulation results demonstrate the enhanced performance measure offered by the proposed framework over existing schemes."
2474723,21212,8228,Asymptotic analysis of the conventional decision feedback receiver in flat fading channels,2002,"The spectral efficiency presents the ultimate limit on the data rate per unit bandwidth of a certain communication system. For the DS-CDMA systems spectral efficiency has been derived for optimal and linear multiuser receivers in the case of synchronous reception, fading and non-fading environment as well as single and multi-cell cellular networks. The most pervasive model employed in all these analyses is the large system random signature model. For the decision feedback receivers the previous research handled only the non-fading case while the case of fading channels remained unknown. This paper analyses the spectral efficiency of the decision feedback receiver in a fading channel with and without power ordering. The results show that in the case of power ordering before cancellation the multiuser diversity effect previously encountered by S. Shamai (Shitz) and Verdu (see IEEE Trans. on Inform. Theory, vol.47, p.1302-27, May 2001) occurs. Multiuser diversity is the effect where the spectral efficiency of a certain multiple-access system improves in fading channels due to the multiplicity of users that share the system and provide the necessary power diversity. Also, analyzed in this paper is the case of imperfectly estimated channel gains in fading environments or the case of imperfect power control. The spectral efficiency loss incurred by this estimation error is analyzed in the case of the conventional decision feedback receiver."
2287603,21212,8228,Optimal QoS-Constrained Resource Allocation in Downlink and Uplink Multicarrier Systems,2011,"When formulated as constrained optimizations of various kinds, resource allocation (RA) in wireless communi- cation systems involves practically not only continuous vari- ables such as transmit power, but also discrete variables such as modulation formats and coding rates. Multicarrier systems with frequency division multiple access (FDMA), e.g. ,O FDMA, require exclusive usage of their subcarriers (or subchannels) by a single user during a certain time unit, and therefore render the assignment of subcarriers a combinatorial problem which is a crucial part of RA. In this paper, we formulate the quality of service (QoS) constrained RA problems in multicarrier systems as optimizations over a finite set of available modes of operations (MOP) and employ integer programming techniques to solve them. Specifically, optimal algorithms are developed based on the branch and bound (BAB) and the branch and price (BAP) methods for three types of RA problems: the downlink transmit power minimization, the uplink sum transmit power minimization, and the downlink transmit power constrained energy minimization. Besides justifying the optimality of these algorithms, simulation results also provide performance comparisons on ARQ and HARQ protocols which serve as an application example of the algorithms proposed, i.e., providing comparison benchmark for different system, protocol, or suboptimal algorithm design.

304080,21212,8228,Cloud empowered Cognitive Inter-cell Interference Coordination for small cellular networks,2015,"In this article, we present a Cloud empowered Cognitive Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (C 2 -ICIC) scheme for small cellular networks. The scheme leverages a recently proposed cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture for enabling intratier coordination and relaxes the need for inter-tier coordination by adopting the phantom cell architecture. Employing tools from stochastic geometry, we characterize the downlink success probability for a Mobile User (MU) scheduled under the proposed coordination scheme. It is shown that, compared to un-coordinated scheduling, significant performance gains can be realized in ultra dense small cell deployment scenarios under the proposed C 2 -ICIC scheme. This is attributed to the robust interference protection provisioned by the scheme. It is demonstrated that the gains are particularly large for the users experiencing a weak received signal strength. Indeed, for these users, the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can only be improved by reducing the experienced aggregate co-channel interference. The closed-form expression derived for the downlink success probability is employed to quantify the link level throughput under the proposed scheme. Finally, we briefly explore the design space of the C 2 -ICIC scheme in terms of interference protection cap which determines both the downlink throughput of the MU scheduled in the coordination mode and the transmission opportunity for the co-channel small cells."
1195138,21212,8228,Best relay selection in cooperative spectrum sharing systems with multiple primary users,2013,"Cooperative spectrum sharing systems (CSSSs) have recently received considerable attention from the wireless community due to their performance gains and spectrum utilization improvement when compared to traditional communication systems. Owing to this fact, we investigate the outage performance of CSSSs in the presence of multiple primary users (PUs). The secondary user (SU) network is composed by one source node, N decode-and-forward (DF) relays, and one destination. A best relay selection strategy is performed where the selected relay is that which maximizes the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, simultaneously, satisfies the interference constraint imposed by the MPU receivers. The communication between the SU source and SU destination is carried out through the help of one out of N DF relays and also via direct link. Afterwards, the SU destination selects the best path between the direct and the relaying path by using selection combining technique. A closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) is derived, and an asymptotic analysis is carried out which reveals that the diversity order of the considered system equals N +1, showing that it is not affected neither by the number of PU receivers nor by the interference threshold. The presented analytical expressions are corroborated by means of Monte Carlo simulations and insightful discussions are provided."
2295252,21212,8228,Highly Accurate Blind Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for Mobile OFDM Systems,2010,"For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems, the orthogonality among subcarriers is lost in mobile applications due to frequency offset resulting from either transmitter-receiver local oscillator differences or Doppler shift caused by mobility. As a direct result, inter-carrier interference (ICI) is observed on each and every subcarrier, leading to significant performance degradation. There are a lot of OFDM carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation schemes classified as data aided estimation and blind estimation. Due to the system power and high bandwidth efficiencies, blind estimators have received a lot of attention recently. Many blind CFO schemes were proposed for OFDM systems, some of which are based on power spectrum smoothing, kurtosis-type cost functions and minimum output variance. In this paper, we propose a novel blind CFO estimator based on Minimum Reconstruction Error (MRE). In contrast to other blind CFO estimators, the proposed technique can be used for any constellation schemes, does not require a large number of blocks to reach acceptable estimation error and provides reliable estimation performance with very low mean square error (MSE). Simulation results in AWGN and multi-path fading channels confirm that performance of the proposed highly accurate blind CFO estimator is superior when frequency offset or time variation occurs in the channel - the proposed technique outperforms most existing blind CFO estimation methods."
2036973,21212,8228,Scheduling variable-size packets in the DAVID metropolitan area network,2004,"DAVID is a research project sponsored by the European Union aimed at the design of an optical packet-switched network for the transport of IP traffic. The DAVID network has a two-level hierarchical structure, with a backbone of optical packet routers interconnected in a mesh, and metropolitan areas served by sets of optical rings interconnected by passive memoryless devices called Hubs. The paper focuses on the metropolitan area network and its components: the nodes and the Huh. Access is regulated by a dynamic time-division multiple-access scheme allocating slots in sets of wavelengths that provide multichannel pipes among ring pairs. This paper proposes a new resource allocation scheme capable of transporting variable-size packets without segmentation into fixed-size data units. Resource sharing among nodes is granted by two scheduling algorithms running on different time scales: the first one is centralized at the Hub and provides coarse connectivity among ring pairs; the second one runs at nodes and provides finer node-to-node connectivity. The Hub scheduling algorithm is derived from well known algorithms in the literature; a novel heuristic scheduling algorithm running at nodes is proposed for datagram (not-guaranteed) traffic and its performance is studied by simulation."
1138505,21212,8228,Interference coordination in CoMP with transmission scheduling and game theoretical power reallocation,2012,"In LTE-A (3GPP LTE-Advance) systems, CoMP (Cooperative Multi-Point) is adopted to enhance the performance of edge users. To maximize the edge user throughput, it is very crucial to properly determine the set of simultaneously served users in the same PRB (physical resource block) and cooperating BSs (base stations) for each selected user, as well as the transmit power of the BSs. In this paper, we first propose a simple scheduling algorithm to choose cell-edge mobile stations (MSs) and cooperating BSs for each PRB according to the RSRP (reference signal receiving power) of each MS, based on which the classic Water-Filling (WF) is applied at each BS to allocate transmit power over all PRBs. However, the objective of single cell power allocation is to maximize the throughput of each individual cell without considering interference among different cooperating BS sets. Therefore, we further formulate a power reallocation mechanism using non-cooperative game theory to refine the single cell WF result for interference coordination, which maximizes the total edge user throughput over all BSs and PRBs by properly taking CCI (co-channel interference) into account. Based on proving the existence of a unique Nash Equilibrium for the formulated game, we design an algorithm to find the Nash Equilibrium and demonstrate the performance gain through extensive simulation studies."
350712,21212,8228,An IoT-based user-centric ecosystem for heterogeneous Smart Home environments,2015,"Recent innovations in the ICT field are strongly focused towards the Internet of Things, which will definitely lead to an enhancement also in the domestic environments. Low-power and low-cost devices are expected to create a network of interconnected smart objects able to transform our homes into real Smart Homes. However, the heterogeneity of the underlying technologies prevents these smart objects to natively interoperate for adapting the environment to users' needs. In addition, common users are often excluded from the development of new applicative services that exploit physical devices, as they do not have sufficient programming and technological skills. To overcome these limitations, we propose a software ecosystem that allows different-skilled users to develop location-aware services able to autonomously manage the Smart Home. These services control the environment in accordance with user-defined rules and the users' location, calculated by exploiting an indoor localization mechanism. In addition, to directly interact with smart devices, users can also define customized interfaces for mobile devices. Finally, a multi-protocol middleware allows both the services and the mobile applications to access the physical network hiding the underlying heterogeneities. As a proof-of-concept, the first implementation steps are presented."
2054087,21212,8228,Using Resource Pools for Pre-Signaled Restoration LSP in ASON Networks,2007,"When considering network restoration, the amount of reserved resources has an important impact on network performance in that it can restrict the acceptance of new connections. Thus, the use of shared resources to support restoration can improve overall network performance. However, efficient resource sharing searches in a global network require extensive computation and database updates. The restoration scheme proposed in this paper can be performed by more than one entity. For instance, one node can perform CPU- intensive computations and send updates to other nodes responsible for the admissions and establishment of new connections on the network. Thus only a small number of nodes are required to store large databases and perform complex path calculations. Within the IETF there are two groups that focus on restoration mechanisms and large-scale networks: CCAMP and PCE. The proposed restoration mechanism can be applied for networks based on the control plane defined by the CCAMP Group. It can also be implemented in GMPLS-based networks where the PCE architecture is present. Here, the scheme is defined for ASON GMPLS-based networks, where LSPs represent lightpaths between OXCs that comprise a control plane compliant with the GMPLS umbrella of protocols. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can provide improved resource savings compared to other restoration schemes and a high robustness for lightpaths that require degrees of protection up to 100%."
1813951,21212,8228,Hybrid Resource Allocation in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,2009,"Inefficient resource management may cause problems of reliability of service in shared medium wireless networks. Resources include bandwidth, processor cycles and buffers. Excessive competition for these resources can cause severe packet collision rates, compound network congestion, or even result in starvation of some nodes. In such a situation, data transmission is subject to very long delays and significant packet losses. Although transport layer protocols can help improve end-to-end performance, these approaches are slow in responding to network changes and incur additional overhead. This paper aims to reduce transmission delay and increase packet delivery ratio. A hybrid resource allocation problem is formulated by the Primal algorithm and a controller is derived to decrease congestion globally and to reduce collisions locally. Our simulation results show that this hybrid controller can achieve packet loss rates close to 1% and significantly shorten end-to-end delay even in a high interference environment with heavy system load. In addition, we also compare the performance of the hybrid controller with the impact of multipath routing. The accuracy of our simulation is improved by adding a probabilistic preamble detection model and SINR collision model based on frame error rate."
1894571,21212,8228,An efficient QoS MAC for IEEE 802.11p over cognitive multichannel vehicular networks,2012,"One of the most challenging issues facing vehicular networks lies in the design of an efficient MAC protocol adaptable to different traffic scenarios (urban and suburban environments). While each environment has its own characteristics leading to different challenges, the merit of this paper lies in developing a MAC protocol suitable for both. In this work, we propose an efficient Multichannel QoS Cognitive MAC solely dedicated for Vehicular Environments (MQOG). MQOG incorporates efficient channel negotiation on the dedicated control channel whereas data is transmitted on other channel without contention. Since vehicular environments are widely known to suffer from interference and multipath, MQOG assesses the quality of channel prior to transmission employing a dynamic channel allocation and negotiation algorithm to achieve significant increase in channel reliability and throughput. The channel assignment problem was solved in an integrated manner while taking into account the QoS of different frames(Safety and NonSafety. The uniqueness of this protocol lies in making use of the ISM Band and UNII-3 in case all available channels in DSRC were considered unreliable. The proposed protocol was implemented in OMNET++ 4.1 and extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed MAC ensures the reception of safety messages much faster, more efficient and reliable than other existing VANet MAC Protocols."
779183,21212,23653,Channel selection algorithms in virtual MIMO sensor networks,2008,"In this paper, we present two practical algorithms to select a subset of channels in virtual MIMO wireless sensor networks (WSN). One is the Singular-Value Decomposition-QR with Threshold (SVD-QR-T) approach that selects the best subset of transmitters while keeping all receivers active. The threshold is adaptive by means of Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM). The other is the Maximum Spanning Tree Searching (MASTS) algorithm on a basis of graph theory in respect of cross-layer design, which potentially provides a path connecting all sensors that benefits routing and QoS of networks. The MASTS algorithm keeps all sensors active but selects  M t   +  M r   -1 subchannels, where  M t   and  M r   are the number of transmitters and receivers, respectively. These two approaches are compared against the case without channel selection in terms of capacity, bit error rate (BER), and multiplexing gain in the presence of water-filling as well as the circumstance of without water-filling under the same total transmission power constraint. Despite less multiplexing gain, when water-filling is applied, MASTS achieves higher capacity and lower BER than that of virtual MIMO without channel selection at moderate to high SNR while SVD-QR-T FCM provides the lowest BER at high SNR; in case of no water-filling and equal transmission power allocation, MASTS still offers the highest capacity at moderate to high SNR but SVD-QR-T FCM achieves the lowest BER. Both algorithms provide satisfying performances with reduced cost and resources compared to the case without channel selection."
2874732,21212,8228,Iterative decoding techniques for ring-type magnitude modulated signals,2016,"The expectations for fifth generation (5G) systems involve handling huge throughputs together with power consumption. In order to address this issue, massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) schemes were developed exploring the fact that any M-ary constellation can be decomposed as several offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) signals, to be amplified by efficient saturated amplifiers and transmitted separately. Since nonlinear amplifiers should be employed with constant envelope signals to avoid nonlinear distortion, a ring-type magnitude modulation (RMM) technique was proposed for bandlimited OQPSK signals to mitigate its envelope fluctuations while maintaining its spectral characteristics. This technique was shown to improve the power amplification efficiency of linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC) transmitters, although with some degradation of the of the detection performance. This paper proposes an iterative decoding scheme relying on the accuracy of the first iteration's log likelihood ratio (LLR) computation to estimate the RMM coefficients of the received symbols. Several LLR computation methods are compared with the ideal case where the receiver knows each symbol's RMM coefficients, and it is shown that a few iterations are enough to obtain a bit error rate (BER) performance close to the best case scenario."

Among the various environment monitoring technologies, the microwave radar detection technology tends to civilian use and plays an important role in environmental safety monitoring. Though rich continuous spectrum resources are available in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, in order to overcome unfavorable path loss, directional beamforming is usually used as an essential technology to concentrate radio signal radiation energy. To ensure the safety of train operation, we propose an mmWave beamforming scheme for railway disaster detection. In this proposed scheme, the concerned area around railways is divided into different detection areas with different danger sensitivity levels. Considering propagation characteristics of radio signals with different frequency bands within a wide frequency range, the antenna array generates multiple beams with different beam widths in different frequency bands simultaneously, and the multiple beams are responsible for different detection areas. Moreover, different detection resolutions are set for different detection areas to apply to different beam scanning schemes. Performance analysis results have demonstrated that the proposed beamforming scheme can not only greatly improve the detection efficiency, but also decrease the false alarm rate."
1924935,21212,8228,Routing and time slot assignment in PLC access networks,2013,"In this work, we address the Routing and Time slot Assignment (R&TA) problem in multi-hop PLC access networks. In our system, time is divided into fixed sized TDM cycles. Each cycle comprises a semi-dynamic bandwidth allocation period (SBAP) and a dynamic bandwidth allocation period (DBAP). The SBAP is used to provide each PLC CPE fixed bandwidth for providing bandwidth guaranteed services. It's a persistent bandwidth provisioning. The bandwidth of DBAP is shared by all of the nodes. This bandwidth is dynamically allocated to each node by a per cycle basis. We take spatial reuse and rate adaption into account. Our design also takes channel quality into consideration in determining the optimal multi-hop routing. We formulate the R&TA problem for the SBAP as an ILP model in which the objective function is to minimize the total bandwidth usage for supporting all bandwidth sensitive services in the network. Since this problem is an NP-hard problem, in order to reduce the computation time, we have developed a Lagrangean relaxation (LR) based algorithm to resolve the problem. For the DBAP part, we propose a token-based scheduling algorithm. Numerical results reveal that the proposed LR algorithm can obtain a near optimal solution in short computation time. For the DBAP part, the proposed token-based scheduling algorithm can provide high throughput especially it can provide excellent fairness for bandwidth sharing among all nodes."
2919691,21212,8228,Analysis of handover performance improvement in cloud-RAN architecture,2012,"With the surge of mobile internet traffic, Cloud RAN (C-RAN) becomes an innovative architecture to help mobile operators maintain profitability and financial growth as well as to provide better services to the customers. It consists of Base Band Units (BBU) of several base stations, which are co-located in a secured place called Central Office and connected to Radio Remote Heads (RRH) via high bandwidth, low latency links. With BBU centralization in C-RAN, handover, the most important feature for mobile communications, could achieve simplified procedure or improved performance. In this paper, we analyze the handover performance of C-RAN over a baseline decentralized RAN (D-RAN) for GSM, UMTS and LTE systems. The results indicate that, lower total average handover interrupt time could be achieved in GSM thanks to the synchronous nature of handovers in C-RAN. For UMTS, inter-NodeB soft handover in D-RAN would become intra-pool softer handover in C-RAN. This brings some gains in terms of reduced signalling, less Iub transport bearer setup and reduced transport bandwidth requirement. For LTE X2-based inter-eNB handover, C-RAN could reduce the handover delay and to a large extent eliminate the risk of UE losing its connection with the serving cell while still waiting for the handover command, which in turn decrease the handover failure rate."
1926460,21212,8228,Analysis of TCP Vegas and TCP Reno,1997,"The best known congestion control mechanism for the TCP/IP protocols, is that proposed by Van Jacobson (1988) dubbed Tahoe. Revised two years after (Van Jacobson, 1990), by including fast recovery and fast retransmit (Stevens, 1994), the new version called Reno achieves more bandwidth utilization and retransmits less data than its predecessor. However its method of predicting the available bandwidth by provoking losses, is the main source of large averages and variances of rtt (round trip time) and also of aggressiveness (network saturation). Brakmo and Peterson (1995) proposed a new congestion avoidance algorithm dubbed Vegas based on some modifications to the source behavior of Reno. In this paper we use an analytic fluid approach in order to analyze the different features of both Vegas and Reno. We then use simulations to confirm our analytic results. When the available bandwidth is high, our results confirm the claims of Brakmo and Peterson (1995) and An et al. (1995); indeed Vegas can retransmit less than one-fifth as much data as Reno does, so that the higher the available bandwidth is, the more efficient Vegas is. However, under heavy congestion Vegas behaves like Reno and does not manage to make efficient use of its new mechanism for detection of congestion. The analytic results that we obtain are the evolution of the window size, round trip times and their averages, and the average throughput."
791504,21212,8228,Energy-efficient power allocation for multicarrier systems with delay-outage probability constraints,2013,"This paper presents an optimal energy-efficient power allocation scheme for a point-to-point multicarrier link over frequency-selective fading channel subject to a delay-outage probability constraint. For a target delay-outage limit, the energy efficiency (EE) objective function is formulated as the ratio of the achieved link effective capacity to the total expenditure power, expressed in units of b/J/Hz. We first prove that this objective function is quasi-concave in the transmission power, and, hence, the global maximum solution of the underlying optimization problem can be obtained using fractional programming. Subsequently, we develop a two-step optimal power allocation algorithm by first obtaining the average sum power level corresponding to the maximum achievable EE, followed by jointly distributing this obtained average power over time and frequency. Analytical results show that the EE-based power allocation has a structure similar to that of the QoS-driven spectral-efficient scheme, but with a different cut-off threshold below which no transmission power is allocated. Simulation results show that the proposed joint optimal power allocation scheme provides significant EE gains over the simple independent subcarrier optimization scheme, where these performance advantages become more pronounced with tighter delay constraints and in fading channels with more severe frequency selectivity."
2385799,21212,8228,Uplink admission control in WCDMA based on relative load estimates,2002,"When operating a cellular radio system at nearly full capacity, admitting yet another user may jeopardize the stability of the system as well as the performance of the individual users. Therefore, proper admission control is crucial. Prior art includes algorithms which limit the number of users or the uplink interference per cell. Both are known to yield roughly the same performance, but the former is difficult to configure, and the latter is based on a quantity which is hard to measure accurately. The core idea in this work is to predict the relative load of the system directly, given that a user is admitted. Then, the user will be admitted if the predicted load in the specific cell, and in its neighbors, is below some threshold. The proposed uplink relative load estimate is focused on WCDMA. It utilizes measurements readily available in that system, either periodically scheduled or from handover events. Multi-services are naturally handled, and availability of high data-rate services are automatically limited with respect to coverage, compared to services of lower data-rate. Simulations indicate that the admission control operates satisfactorily in different traffic situations with a universal parameter setting. Furthermore, the reporting overhead with periodical measurements can be avoided, since handover event-driven measurements yield roughly the same performance."
1167338,21212,8228,Multi objective design for bacterial communication networks,2013,"In this paper we discuss the bacterial network communication design with respect to metabolic information processing. The potentialities of designing routing network schemes based on bacteria motility will depend on the genes coding for the intracellular and intercellular communication molecular devices. An additional element is given by the “mobilome” which is related to horizontal gene transfer. First, by using a multi-objective optimization procedure, we search for the optimal trade off between energy production, which is a requirement for the motility, and the biomass growth, which is related to the overall survival and fitness of the bacterium. We use flux balance analysis of genome-scale biochemical network of Escherichia coli k-13 MG1655. Then, as a second case study we analyze the electric properties and biomass trade-off of the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens. This bacterium is usually grown on a graphite electrode. It constructs an electric biofilm where electrons move across the nanowires. Geobacter species produce higher current densities than any other known organism. Our methodology could estimate the evolutionary potential and help in designing optimal multi scale properties from networks to behavior. Moreover, we point to genetic design and synthetic biology as key areas to develop bacterial nano communication networks."

We propose a new capture model, message retraining, as a means of providing an accurate description of experimental data. Using two fairness indices we undertake a quantitative study of the accuracy with which each capture model is able to reflect experimental data. Standard capture models are shown to be unable to accurately reflect the fairness properties of empirical data. The message retraining capture model is shown to provide a good estimate of actual system performance in varying signal strength conditions."

654029,21212,369,DEAR: an extension of traffic engineering for routing and resource management in ad hoc wireless networks,2002,"We propose differentiated engineered adaptable routing (DEAR) for quality-of-service (QoS) routing in ad hoc mobile wireless networks. In DEAR, traffic is engineered for both its locations (as in conventional traffic engineering) and its amount according to the proposed demand-engineered QoS routing. Moreover, QoS is provisioned in a differentiated manner through the proposed differentiated QoS routing, and is adaptable to traffic and network conditions through the proposed adaptable QoS routing. DEAR is generally applicable to previous routing paradigms and QoS routing algorithms based on on-demand, table-driven, or localized routing. We also develop DEAR STAR (selective table-driven ad hoc routing) and DEAR POWER (power-aware on-demand wireless embedded routing) to enable QoS-guaranteed and power-aware routing in ad hoc networks by utilizing stationary wireless stations and/or through dynamic maintenance of virtual stationary nodes. Finally, we apply backward learning to QoS routing in ad hoc networks."
2501774,21212,369,Mobile Ad Hoc Network for Motorway Transport Applications,2007,"Mobile ad hoc networks in road transport applications exhibit special characteristics, mainly due to their dynamic chain behaviour. In this paper, we introduce a node decision algorithm in both the routing and packet priority mechanism, based on the node's driving direction with respect to the next hope towards packet destination. In the routing algorithm, a router direction index (RDI) parameter is introduced to enhance the performance of AODV in updating its routing table, as well as to assist the destination nodes to choose route requests from different paths in inter-vehicular ad hoc network scenarios. A packet transmission priority is set according to the driving direction of both transmitter and receiver of the packet. Simulation results of the proposed algorithm for 200 vehicles travelling at speeds between 60 ~ 120 km/h on a 2-directional highway demonstrate a performance increase in the packet delivery ratio, and decrease in the packet end to end delay and routing overhead for the proposed algorithm"
1829686,21212,369,Impact of Best Effort Frame Bursting in IEEE 802.11 Networks,2009,"Wireless LAN strongly prioritizes high priority traf- fic over low priority best effort traffic. This causes reduced access to the medium for low priority traffic and under some conditions even leads to starvation. To compensate the throughput reduction of low priority traffic, we propose frame bursting in this paper. That means low priority traffic is sent infrequently, but many frames may be sent in a burst. Our simulation results show that the throughput of the low priority best effort traffic class can be significantly increased without disrupting high priority traffic.

2225917,21212,369,A Low Complexity MIMO Detection Based on Pair-Wise Markov Random Fields,2011,"Low complexity, iterative MIMO detection algorithms are derived based on pair-wise Markov random fields (MRF). We consider two types, namely, the fully-connected and the ring type MRF and, for the edge potentials, we use the bivariate Gaussian function obtained by marginalizing the posterior joint probability density under Gaussian-input assumption. Since the corresponding factor graphs has only 2 edges per factor node, the computations are much easier than that of ML which is similar to the belief propagation algorithm run over the fully connected factor graph. Compared to the complexity of ML, O(2 mM ), the proposed scheme for the fully-connected and the ring-type MRF is shown to have only O(M ·(M-1) 2 m-1 ) and O(M·2 m ), respectively, for M being the input dimension and m the number of bits per data symbol.

In order to improve capacity and coverage performance, both of them addressed a fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme to combat co-channel interference in multi-cell deployment, which is referred to as FFR 16  and FFR 20  respectively in this paper. As for the scheme of FFR 20 , virtual area partition is proposed in this paper, and fractional frequency reuse factor (FFRF) is achieved by tuning the parameter of signal strength ratio. The optimal combination of resource allocation strategy and signal strength ratio is determined through simulation. In order to compare the performance of FFR 16  and FFR 20 , three evaluation metrics are introduced, including average throughput, outage probability and spectrum efficiency. Simulation results show that outage probability is much lower under FFR 20  scheme, which goes beyond the acceptable range when FFRF is smaller than 2.4. The resource utilization efficiencies of both are continuously increasing with regard to FFRF within range [2.4, 3]. Besides, FFR 20  outperforms FFR 16  under given conditions, in terms of average throughput and spectrum efficiency."

To this end, we show that there exists an optimal value for ρth, which maximizes the transmission capacity that depends on the highway setup and the traffic intensity."
2340851,21212,369,Energy and Spectrum Efficient Systems with Adaptive Modulation and Spectrum Sharing for Cellular Systems,2011,"Increasing concern about the energy consumption of cellular networks is driving operators to optimise energy utilisation without sacrificing user experience. In this paper, we consider the capability of spectrum sharing between two or more operators with the objective of achieving energy-efficient operation. Since each operator has a fixed amount of spectrum, they are required to increase the modulation index to achieve a higher data rate for a targeted QoS, which increases the demand on energy. We study the effect of using energy-efficient multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) with the capability of spectrum sharing between operators. Simulations show that using adaptive modulation with spectrum sharing between base stations of different operators can give a more flexible region for the system to operate with a reasonable trade-off."

2142665,21212,369,Digital Predistortion for Power Amplifiers in Hybrid MIMO Systems with Antenna Subarrays,2015,We consider digital predistortion (DPD) for linearizing power amplifiers (PAs) of hybrid MIMO systems with subarrays. Designing such a DPD scheme is difficult because one DPD should linearize all PAs of a subarray whose beamforming coefficients are time-varying. We develop an adaptive DPD technique for each subarray based on direct learning method minimizing the sum of squared errors between the input and output signals of PAs. Use of the least mean square (LMS) Newton algorithm is proposed to adaptively control the DPD parameters. It is shown that the proposed DPD can simultaneously linearize multiple PAs in a subarray irrespective of its beamforming coefficients. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can perform better than an alternative scheme that designs the DPD based on one of the PA outputs and uses the resulting DPD for all PAs of the subarray.

We formulate the problem of placement of RSUs and selecting their configurations (e.g. power level, types of antenna and wired/wireless back haul network connectivity) as a linear program. The objective function is to minimize the total cost to deploy and maintain the network of RSU's. A user specified constraint on the minimum coverage provided by the RSU is also incorporated into the optimization framework. Further, the framework also supports the option of specifying selected regions of higher importance such as locations of frequently occurring accidents and incorporating constraints requiring stricter coverage in those areas. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of deployment on the campus map of Southern Methodist University (SMU).

However how to perform precise switching optimally in practical systems involving non-flat fading channels and several adaptive techniques is seldom treated. We therefore investigate this problem and propose a general optimal switching scheme. This paper gives a framework of such a scheme for link adaptation and a detailed designing procedure. We present a vigorous proof of the optimality condition and show that the optimal switching boundaries have a linear relationship, which is independent of coding, modulation and channels. Also, we extend this scheme to multicarrier, MIMO and multiservice systems to ensure global optimality. With low complexity, optimality, and generality the proposed general optimal switching scheme provides a promising technique to substantially increase the spectral efficiency of practical communication systems."

The remote controllability and trackability of microbots lead to such a “touch-communication” (TouchCom) mode. These microbots (i.e., message carriers in the context of molecular communications) are responsible for the delivery of contrast agent nanoparticles (i.e., message). The loading/injection and unloading of the contrast agent correspond to the transmitting and receiving processes, respectively. Subsequently, we define the propagation delay, path loss, as well as angular and delay spectra of targeting intensity, which are parallel to their counterpart concepts in the conventional wireless channel and are important parameters from the perspectives of both targeting and communication. We also present simulation tools for the propagation and transient characteristics of microbots in the blood vessels."

One benefit is its simplicity (evaluating 23 static features with moderate resource constrains), so it might support the application on large file amounts, e.g. for network-operators or a posteriori analyses in archival systems. After identifying promising features and their typical values, a custom hypothesis-based classification model and a statistical classification approach using the WEKA machine learning tool [3] are generated and evaluated.

2916716,21212,8228,Automated handover optimization mechanism for LTE femtocells,2012,"The introduction of femtocells results in more frequent initiation of handover procedure, which leads to a huge amount of signaling overhead in the network. For indoor deployed femtocells, most of the frequent handovers are initiated in some special areas where the subscribers' mobility characteristic is special, such as frequently step in and out of the femtcell coverage at a balcony. While in general areas, the mobility of subscribers seldom results in frequent handovers. In this paper, an automated handover optimization mechanism is proposed for femtocells in LTE. The proposed mechanism could differentiate the special areas and general areas by dint of an ACO (ant colony optimization) algorithm, and then configures different HM (hysteresis margin) for different areas in the same femtocell coverage.

The algorithms are then employed to propose a fast algorithm for vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time architecture (V-BLAST). The proposed inverse LDL' factorization avoids the conventional back substitution of the Cholesky factor, and then has the speedups of 1.19 over the square root and division free alternative Cholesky factorization plus the back substitution. The proposed wide-sense Givens rotation requires the same computational complexity as the efficient Givens rotation. The speedups of the proposed V-BLAST algorithm over the recursive V-BLAST algorithm are 1.05~1.4. The difference between the complexity of the proposed V-BLAST algorithm and that of the square-root V-BLAST algorithm is trivial and even negligible. However, the square-root V-BLAST algorithm requires many square-root and division operations, while the proposed V-BLAST algorithm requires no square-root operations, and requires only one division for each transmit signal, which can be postponed until the signal estimation is required."
1809338,21212,369,"A Multiuser, Multicarrier Link Adaptation Strategy for Fading Channels with PER Constraints",2011,"Link Adaptation can dynamically adjust a number of transmission parameters, most often modulation and coding, to reflect the characteristics of the wireless link to improve throughput and maintain link reliability. Most LA algorithms require only an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to select an appropriate PHY mode, relying on the assumption of an AWGN channel. For channels experiencing frequency selective fading however, the conventional approach fails to accurately represent the stochastic variability across independent channels, resulting in inaccurate prediction of the current channel state and failure in selecting appropriate transmission parameters. A new channel quality metric is proposed in this paper that attempts to estimate the likelihood of packet errors in a fading channel and adjust Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection across each fading realisation independently. Results show improved mode selection efficiency over the conventional LA approach with added flexibility, as this approach is independent of the channel environment, providing a universal solution to LA."

It first demonstrates how the frequency selectivity of propagation processes causes fundamental differences between UWB channels and conventional (narrowband) channels. The concept of pathloss has to be modified, and the well-known WSSUS model is not applicable anymore. The paper also describes deterministic and stochastic models for UWB channels, identifies the key parameters for the description of delay dispersion, attenuation, and directional characterization, and surveys the typical parameter values that have been measured. Measurement techniques and methods for extracting model parameters are also different in UWB channels; for example, the concepts of narrowband channel parameter estimation (e.g., maximum-likelihood estimation) have to be modified. Finally, channel models also have an important impact on the performance evaluation of various UWB systems."

The speedups of our square-root BLAST algorithm over the previous square-root BLAST algorithm in the number of multiplications and additions are 3.78-5.8 and 3.95-5 respectively, and the ratios between the computational complexity of our BLAST algorithm and that of the linear MMSE detection algorithm in the number of multiplications and additions are 1.10-0.71 and 0.90-0.71 respectively, which means that for the first time, the nonlinear MMSE BLAST detector with successive interference cancellation can have even lower complexity than the linear MMSE detector. Moreover, our BLAST algorithm is also numerically stable and hardware friendly, since it uses unitary transformations to avoid the matrix inversions, and gets the initial square-root which is equivalent to a Cholesky factor of the estimation error covariance matrix."
1501525,21212,8228,Collaborative wireless nanobots for tumor discovery and drug delivery,2012,"Current approaches in combating cancer employ nanoparticle-based therapies that harness biological and chemical phenomena to deliver anticancer drugs. Successful studies have shown the utility of leveraging biochemical cues to recruit nanoparticles to the tumor microenvironment. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using collaborative wireless nanobots or WiNoBots to efficiently target and accumulate at the site of tumor tissues. Unlike biological and chemical approaches, nanobots directly communicate with each other via wireless signals. Signaling nanobots emit a wireless signal to receiving nanobots, which move in the direction of the electric field gradient. Together these nanobots concert a collaborative action to home to the site of a signal. Using computer simulations, we show that collaborative wireless signaling produces an aggregate wavefront that reduces the mean path length that nanobots travel to reach the site of a diseased tissue. Our results motivate further studies of these unique nanobot wireless systems, which may be able to confine and concentrate a therapeutic response."
320403,21212,8228,Impact of SACK delay and link delay on Failover performance in SCTP,2006,"The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) was developedto support the transfer of telephony signaling overIP networks. One of the ambitions when designing SCTPwas to offer a robust transfer of traffic between hosts. Forthis reason SCTP was designed to support multihoming,which gives the possibility to set up several paths betweenthe same hosts in the same session. If the primary path betweena source machine and a destination machine breaksdown, the traffic may still be sent to the destination by utilizingone of the alternate paths. The failover that occurswhen changing path is to be transparent to the application.Consequently, the time between occurrence of a break onthe primary path until the traffic is run smoothly on one ofthe alternate paths is important. This paper presents experimentalresults concerning SCTP failover performance. Thefocus in this paper is to evaluate the impact of the SACKdelay and link delay on the failover time as well as on themaximum transfer time for a single message, which complementsearlier studies in this area. The results show asignificant performance impact of the SACK delay as wellas of the link delay. This suggests that the SACK delayis an important parameter to tune to enhance applicationtransparency in failure situations"
3000721,21212,369,The Potential of Offloading and Spectrum Sharing for 5G Vehicular Infotainment,2016,"This paper explores the possibility of opportunistic cognitive radio based offloading for infotainment services in future autonomous vehicles. With the goal of a truly intelligent vehicle, research into the potential of vehicular communications intends to facilitate a wide range of services from safety aspects such as collision prevention to in-car information and entertainment (infotainment) services. With such a broad remit, future vehicles will likely have to rely on multiple communication technologies to successfully service their needs. In this paper we identify the benefits of offloading to WiFi via Drive-thru Internet in vehicular applications but note the damaging handover overheads introduced by such schemes. Instead we propose a method of opportunistic access based on Beacon Interval Whitetime to macro-cellular WiFi access points as a means of sustaining an active connection whilst moving through an urban environment. This will reduce the inefficiencies of successive handovers and enable increased volumes of content to be delivered to the vehicle. We perform an empirical study of the potential for offloading in a representative urban environment and find periods of upto 100 ms per second are available for opportunistic use throughout the test. Additionally we find semi-deterministic opportunities for cognitive access occur following 35% of beacons observed on a WiFi channel."
3184709,21212,8228,Multicast Channel Communication with Interactive Receiver Cooperation over Orthogonal Links,2017,"We consider the multicast channel (MC), in which a transmitter broadcasts only a common message to two receivers. In our previous work, we have derived information-theoretic upper and lower bounds and showed that the two-round receiver cooperation (2RC) scheme, in which the receivers interactively perform compress-forward and then decode-forward, improves the MC achievable rate over different schemes from the literature, in the general case of full-duplex bi-directional non-orthogonal cooperation links. In this paper, we concentrate on the orthogonal cooperation to identify the properties of this interactive cooperation. We show that the full-duplexing between the cooperation links is not essential to take advantage of most of the gain offered by the 2RC full-duplex scheme, while the full-duplexing between the MC and the cooperation links brings most of the gain."
2001249,21212,369,A Novel Approach to Indoor RSSI Localization by Automatic Calibration of the Wireless Propagation Model,2009,"We propose a novel localization algorithm of mobile sensors based on wireless sensor networks providing RSSI measurements between the mobile and the fixed sensors (anchors) in the network. The algorithm selects and weights the RSSI measurements according to their strength, and it uses a propagation model to transform RSSI measurements into distances, in order to estimate the position of the mobile. The algorithm also uses a virtual calibration method of the propagation model that does not require human intervention. By an experimental setup we show that the localization algorithm increases the performance with respect to the commonly used least mean square algorithm showing also how to achieve a wished accuracy increasing the anchor density."
897609,21212,369,Analysis of Multipath Interference of SRAKE Receivers in UWB Systems,2010,"This paper analyzes the interference in Direct Sequence Spreading Spectrum (DSSS) systems with Selective RAKE (SRAKE) receivers where channel delay is comparable with spreading sequence length. We build an accurate output model of SRAKE receiver and derive the output Signal to Interference-Noise Ratio (SINR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) of SRAKE receiver, taking multipath effect into consideration. Based on this nalysis, we showed that in frequency selective channels with SRAKE receiver, system become interference limited as transmit power increases. Besides, there exists a critical spreading factor. When spreading factor is lower than this critical value, $E_b/N_0$ have to increase dramatically to compensate the multipath effect. This provide a criterion to adaptively choose the optimal preading factor under different channel conditions."
1733753,21212,369,Optimal Queueing Control in Hybrid Overlay/Underlay Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks,2012,"Recently overlay/underlay framework in Cognitive Radio have been studied and it demonstrated the benefits such as spectrum efficiency and channel capacity maximization. Arising from these work, we suppose the secondary users can operate under overlay mode when the primary user is absent and operate under underlay mode when the primary user is present. In this paper, a hybrid overlay/underlay cognitive radio system is modeled as a M/M/1 queue where the rate of arrival and the service capacity are subject to Poisson alternations. Each packet (as a customer) arriving at the queue makes decision to join or balk the queue. Upon arrival, the individual decision of each packet is optimized based on his observation about the queue length and the state of system. We will present the individual strategy of each customer in detail in this paper."
1308093,21212,369,Optimized Channel Estimation for OFDMA Uplink with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalance,2014,"I/Q imbalance (IQI) is one of the major front-end imperfections affecting the performance of communication systems. Due to frequency-dependent (FD) IQI, channel is elongated and is split into direct and image channels. We consider the problem of joint estimation of the channel and I/Q parameters for OFDM based systems. Time-domain estimation of the effective channel taps poses a question: what is the optimal number of taps that need to be estimated for the best estimation performance? More the estimated taps, more is the noise contribution to the estimator. Lesser the estimated taps, less is the precision due to unestimated taps. In this paper, we address this issue by deriving analytic expressions for mean squared errors (MSE) of estimates of the effective channels and conditions for their optimization. In the absence of channel knowledge, we propose a choice of number of taps to improve estimation performance."
1825707,21212,369,Simultaneous Feedback Reduction and Sum Rate Maximization in Block-Diagonalized Space-Division Multiplexing,2008,"A major hindrance to the adoption of orthogonalized space-division multiplexing (SDM) via block diagonalization (BD) in multi-user MIMO downlinks is the need for channel state information (CSI) feedback from user terminals. Another drawback is lower than optimal sum rates, theoretically achievable with dirty paper coding (DPC). While multi-user diversity could be leveraged via user selection to narrow the sum- rate performance gap, it requires the presence of very large user pools. To help raise the practical feasibility of BD-SDM, we propose a scheme that jointly reduces CSI feedback while approaching optimal DPC sum rates with smaller user-pool sizes. Additionally, BD-SDM offers the flexibility for spatial mode allocation to cater for individual transmission rate requirements. This presents a challenging resource allocation problem because mode selection at one terminal affects the rates achieved at all other terminals and in turn, the overall sum rate. The proposed scheme offers a systematic means for resource allocation, while minimizing rate loss at the overall- and individual levels. It represents a streamlined process that simultaneously reduces CSI feedback while achieving sum rate maximization, user selection and systematic rate-loss minimizing resource allocation."
2041078,21212,369,Orthogonal Complex Hadamard Spreading Codes for I/Q Imbalance Mitigation in MC-CDMA Systems,2007,Zero-IF (direct conversion) receivers are very sensitive to non-linearities of analog hardware. A phase and/or amplitude imbalance between the inphase and quadrature signal branch results in a base band signal deterioration known as I/Q imbalance. Especially OFDM and the OFDM-based MC-CDMA modulation technique are affected by this error. This paper proposes a novel orthogonal quaternary MC-CDMA spreading code scheme that uses the inherent mathematical symmetry to mitigate I/Q imbalance without additional computational cost.

We discuss the decode-and-forward type relay station within the context of the 3GPP RLC/MAC layers. The emphasis is on proper RLC layer operation for the relay-enhanced-cell (REC). RLC layer evolvement in the future high data rate radio access network will first be discussed, then its performance in REC will be investigated, with or without it being implemented on the relay station. Simulations are conducted on the downlink for the future OFDMA-based relay network, from which we finally draw significant conclusions."

Traditionally, adaptive modulation has been proven to be an efficient solution to improve the system performance over the radio fading channels. To obtain the design insights for energy efficient adaptive modulation scheme, we shall introduce a circuit-level power modeling to analyze the effects and characterize the bandwidth-power-energy efficiency tradeoff relations for wireless communication systems. We show that different bandwidth, power and modulation schemes shall be used under different channel conditions to maximize the energy efficiency and the adaptive modulation scheme can greatly help to improve the tradeoff curves."
1688783,21212,369,Performance Evaluation of Energy Detection for Correlated Random Signals,2013,"This paper investigates the performance of energy detection (ED) for random signals having sufficient autocorrelation. As opposed to the uncorrelated noise, practical communication signals have autocorrelation, which can be exploited for optimal detection if the correlation is known a priori. Otherwise ED can be employed as a generalized sensing method for unknown signals. However, since ED is optimal only when signal samples are uncorrelated, its performance degrades due to the correlation present. We investigate the detection performance of ED both analytically and by simulation under the assumption of Gaussian signal having exponential autocorrelation function. Analysis and simulation show that the performance degradation is negligible for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, and also for the first-lag correlation less than 0.5. For highly correlated signals, the degradation is pronounced when SNR is above -12 dB."

Self Organizing Network (SON) functionalities promise significant improvement of the network in terms of reducing OPerational EXpenditure (OPEX) and performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a recursive automated optimization method which builds statistical models of the functional relationships between noisy Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and network parameters; and performs stochastic optimization during the model building process. The proposed methodology is applied to a centralized intra-LTE Mobility Load Balancing (MLB) problem and its performance is evaluated through system level simulations. The results show that the proposed modeling and optimization approach is a promising solution for centralized intra-LTE MLB in terms of optimization performance and convergence under noisy data."
2425526,21212,369,Cognitive Radio Sensing Architecture and a Sensor Selection Case Study,2009,"The function of a cognitive radio system (CRS) can be classified as cognitive engine (CE) and sensing. The CE fulfills spectrum analysis and decision making of spectrum access. The sensing function is realized by either a CR node or distributed spectrum sensors. In this paper, we propose a sensing architecture, which adds new functional entities, sensing controller (SC) and sensing information processor (SIP) inside CE and sensing, respectively. Based on the architecture, we give a use case where sensing is realized by distributed sensors. Selection of these sensors is performed in Rayleigh fading channel to improve the detection performance and save power consumption. Using analytical analysis we prove the benefits of sensor selection. Results show that using energy detection with 5000 symbols in - 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment, we can reduce the false alarm rate from 0.95 to 0.1 while keeping 99% protection to primary users by selecting among ten sensors. Results also show that it is beneficial perform selection based on user channel."

The performance is analyzed in the chip synchronous case and thus the derived performance results in the upper bounds. The results show that the optical asynchronous CDMA systems with double optical hard-limiters have much better performance than other conventional asynchronous CDMA systems with and without the optical hard-limiter even when the number of simultaneous users is large, which is different from the case of optical synchronous CDMA systems."
664723,21212,8494,A psychiatric patients tracking system,2006,"This paper presents an RFID based psychiatric patient tracking system in a psychiatric patient care center. In this system, RFID field generators and readers are installed in the environment, near the entrance and exit points for tracking the patients. Every patient is required to wear the tag. When a tag receives the call from a field generator, it responds to a reader with the ID of the field generator issuing the calling. Based on the field generator IDs a tag responds, the location of the patient associated with the tag can be approximately estimated. By so doing, not only the patient's moving patterns can be recorded but also the event of the patient leaving the main gate of the care center be detected. Besides the localization issue, in this paper we also employed a graphic coloring approach for solving the interference caused from field generator located one near another. Experimental results show that this algorithm has significantly improved the reliability of the tracking system."
2260282,21212,369,A Resource Block Assignment Scheme for OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks with Self-Organizing Terminal Relays,2011,"Effective coordination between terminal relays in OFDMA-based systems becomes a cumbersome task with the increase in the number of these relays. To address this drawback, in this paper an autonomous scheme is proposed whereby the relays assign resource blocks to incoming wireless terminals (WTs) in a way that minimizes the number of hit occurrences at which the same resource block is assigned to other WTs. The proposed scheme uses cyclic group generators to determine the sequence of resource blocks to be assigned by each relay. This scheme is particularly beneficial in self-organizing terminal relaying systems in which the distribution of the wireless terminals is nonuniform. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is significantly better than that of assignment schemes proposed in the literature."
1482354,21212,369,Adaptive HARQ with Memoryless Relays,2011,"In a relay enhanced system the classical HARQ schemes should be adapted to exploit the better channel conditions of the relay in comparison to the direct link. In particular, we need to decide which node (either the source or one of the relays) should retransmit and how many resources have to be spent to avoid further retransmissions. This adaptation should be optimized with respect to the trade-off between Frame Error Rate (FER) and the required resources. We propose an approach based on accumulated Mutual Information (MI) for relay networks applying different relay functions. We consider several memoryless relay functions without channel decoding aiming for simple and cheap relays. Beside the well-known Amplify-Forward (AF) and Detect-Forward (DetF) schemes, we also consider a soft-information relaying function called Estimate-Forward (EF) as this provides higher Mutual Information than AF and DetF. We show that our proposed HARQ retransmission scheme can improve the throughput significantly, especially if EF is applied at the relay."
2998223,21212,369,Performance Analysis of Interweave Cognitive Radio Systems with Imperfect Channel Knowledge over Nakagami Fading Channels,2016,"Knowledge of interacting channels is essential for characterizing the performance of a cognitive radio system in terms of interference power received by a primary receiver and throughput at a secondary receiver. Baseline models considered for the performance characterization assume perfect knowledge of the interacting channels. Recently, an analytical framework has been proposed that incorporates channel estimation and subsequently characterizes the performance of cognitive Interweave Systems (ISs). However, the analysis was pertained to the deterministic behaviour of the interacting channels. In this paper, we extend the characterization of the aforementioned framework to investigate the influence of channel fading on the performance of the IS. Our analysis indicate that an inappropriate choice of estimation time can severely degrade the performance of the IS in terms of achievable secondary throughput."
1671673,21212,369,Network Coded Modulation with HDF Strategy and Optimized Beam-Forming in 2-Source 2-Relay Network,2011,The paper address the Network Coded Modulation (NCM) with Hierarchical Decode and Forward (HDF) strategy in the 2-source 2-relay scenario with SIMO (Single-Input Multiple-Output) fading channels. The NCM/HDF technique is known to be vulnerable to the mutual phase rotations of the signals from the sources. We use additional degrees of freedom in SIMO channels and create a specific receiver beam-forming tailored for given NCM/HDF strategy. We derive a closed form solution of the NCM/HDF specific beam-former and apply it on example NCMs. We evaluate the performance in terms of the mean and the outage hierarchical rates. It is shown that these rates significantly benefit from the beam-forming and that the resulting rate significantly outperforms classical (non WNC (Wireless Network Coding)) channel sharing techniques.
2451518,21212,369,Power Allocation for OFDM Based Links in Hybrid Forward Relay,2009,"In this paper, we consider a two-hop orthogonal fre- quency division multiplexing (OFDM) relay link, and investigate the system capacity in hybrid forward (HF) relay through the power allocation (PA). The expression of the system capacity in HF relay is provided. Two situations about the power constraint are concerned, and under each situation, the selection criterion among different forwarding schemes in HF relay is proposed by means of capacity comparison on the subcarrier pair. From the selection criterions, the source or relay can adaptively choose the best scheme for every subcarrier pair according to the channel condition. Then the optimal solutions of the relay PA and the joint PA are derived to maximize the capacity. In the simulation, the advantage of the HF relay is shown in terms of capacity improvement compared with the conventional forward relay."
3002387,21212,369,Regular and Static Sector-Based Cell Switch-Off Patterns,2016,"Energy saving in cellular networks can be achieved by implementing the cell switch-off (CSO) approach in periods of light traffic. Regular static CSO (CSO patterns) is a type of CSO where the set of active cells is predetermined such that they are located on a regular grid. It is known that regular cell layouts generally provide the best coverage and downlink SINR. Furthermore, CSO patterns assure that interfering cells are as far away as possible and help in modeling interference accurately. Existing lit- erature on CSO patterns focuses only on site-level CSO (switching off entire BSs); however, significant gains can sometimes be obtained from sector-level CSO patterns (switching off individual sectors). This paper is the first to introduce and investi- gate sector- based regular CSO patterns by providing illustrative examples. We compare the performances of different CSO patterns in terms of the number of supported users. Also, we analytically compare site- based versus sector-based CSO patterns in terms of power saving. Our results show that patterns with only one of the three sectors active (each with the same orientation) can support the most users per sector, due to a favourable interference situation."
2657775,21212,369,Bit-Level List Generation for Iterative MIMO Receivers,2015,"The list demapper has been widely employed for coded multiple-input multiple-output (coded-MIMO) receivers, where only a list of signal vectors is examined in the calculation of likelihood ratio. In the literature, the search of list is operated in the symbol level in accordance with a search metric defined as a function of signal (symbol) vector. Since a signal vector is mapped from a group of (coded) bits, the search may be operated in the bit level if the search metric is made from the aspect of bit. In this paper, beginning with the study of a posteriori probability of bit, a bit-level list generation is proposed for iterative coded-MIMO receivers. With the information coming out of decoder, promising bit tuples can be searched in a low-complexity way, and then mapped to signal vectors for the calculation of likelihood ratio. By the complexity analysis and performance simulation, the proposed bit-level list generation is shown to have a good performance-complexity tradeoff over other existing methods."
1172342,21212,369,On Indexing of Lattice-Constellations for Wireless Network Coding with Modulo-Sum Decoding,2013,"We consider wireless (physical-layer) network coding 2-way relaying where both terminals use constellations curved from a common lattice structure and the relay node decodes modulo-sum operation of transmitted data symbols at the multiple-access stage. Performance of such a system with additive white Gaussian noise is strongly determined by used constellation indexing. For some indexing, the minimal distance of modulo-sum decoding is 0 (some points of superimposed- constellation are equal despite corresponding to unequal modulo-sum of data symbols) which causes considerable loss in alphabet-constrained capacity. In this paper, we show that if indices form a modulo-arithmetic progression along each lattice (real) dimension (denoted Affine Indexing (AI)), the minimal distance of modulo-sum decoding equals to minimal distance of primary terminal constellation. Some canonical constellation shapes prevent existence of AI, therefore we propose a greedy-sphere packing algorithm for constellation shape design which jointly maximises minimal distance and keeps existence of AI."
2359672,21212,369,A Lattice-Reduction Aided List Demapper for Coded MIMO Receiver,2013,"The max-log list demapper has been widely employed in the implementations of a coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver, where only a candidate-list of signal vectors is examined in the likelihood-ratio calculation to reduce complexity. Traditionally, the candidate-list is generated in the original-lattice domain which, unfortunately, results in a severe degradation in the performance of demapper if the channel is in ill-condition. In this paper, a new lattice-reduction aided max-log list demapper is proposed in which the candidate-list is generated after a successive cancellation of multi-layer interference in the lattice-reduced domain. Thanks to the newly designed metrics and search algorithms for the generation of the candidate-list, the proposed demapper provides significant gains over the existing methods, especially for the cases with a small list size and/or under a spatially-correlated channel."
2183272,21212,369,Practical Demonstration of Limited Feedback Beamforming for mmWave Systems,2015,"This paper presents a practical demonstration of the benefits of limited feedback beamforming for mmWave applications. Different beamforming strategies are presented, analysed and compared. Compressive sensing (CS) is investigated to accurately estimate the sparse Power Angular Profile (PAP) of the mmWave channel. This information is then used to estimate the antenna array weights required to steer the beam to maximise received SNR. This scheme is particularly attractive for outdoor mmWave networks where large antenna arrays are necessary to mitigate high observed pathloss. Codebook based beamforming strategies are also analysed. Using a practical mmWave antenna away, measurements are reported for a controlled multipath channel that compare the performance of the proposed beamforming strategies. In terms of received SNR CS based beamforming was shown to outperform more traditional codebook based solutions by to 5dB."

This paper investigates, assuming such a situation, the effectiveness of BS cooperation (BSC) in MIMO (multiple input multiple output) cellular system under irregular cell geometry. The cell shapes are determined by BS position based on Voronoi diagram, namely, UTs (user terminals) communicate the nearest BS. The influence of BS displacement is evaluated for several patterns using typical spatial processing algorithms. Through computer simulations, it is demonstrated that the BSC is effective under this situation, and how the BS displacement affects the system performance."
2897269,21212,8228,Fast and reliable warning message dissemination mechanism in urban expressway VANETs,2016,"Disseminating warning information by vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is of great significance to alleviate traffic problems in future intelligent transportation systems. However, in the urban expressway environment, it is critically challenging to design efficient dissemination mechanisms with strict quality-of-service (QoS) requirements due to complex road structures. In this paper, we propose the fast and reliable warning message dissemination mechanism (FRWD), where emergency messages can be delivered to a specific area (e.g., the entrance/exit of the expressway) in time and keep alive for a while. Hence, drivers can be informed to detour timely and avoid getting stuck on the expressway. In this scheme, two types of forwarders, relay vehicles and backup vehicles, are selected by balancing the forward progress and packet reception probability. Furthermore, a vehicle in the specific area is designed to periodically broadcast with a reasonable time interval. Through this, message dissemination with low latency and high reliability can be achieved. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism."
3041184,21212,369,Multi-Zone Propagation in Millimeter-Wave Bands for Indoor Hotspot Deployment,2016,"The indoor hotspot propagation loss has been investigated for several frequency bands from 3.5 GHz to 73 GHz. The measurement campaigns were conducted in multiple different indoor offices world-wide. Analysis of these measurements reveals a number of underlying physical phenomena affecting the propagation behavior. A Multi-zone propagation concept is introduced to aid classification and analysis of the millimeter wave specific propagation characteristics. The propagation zones are indicative of differing interaction of the mm-Wave signals with the details of the environment. Many very close range measurements follow a free space propagation phenomenon. For longer LOS propagation, a waveguide propagation zone can be observed. For NLOS propagation, at least two scattering propagation zones can be observed. Together, understanding the environment and the multiple modes of propagation aids the coverage analysis for system deployments."

In this scheme, the messages are divided into a set of blocks, and these blocks are transmitted by different modes with different wavelengths, according to a pre-negotiated pattern. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme affords multiple simultaneous bidirectional message transmissions, and the security can be greatly enhanced. The proposed scheme provides a new way to implement high speed multichannel chaos communication with high security."
1854904,21212,369,Irregular Distributed Space-Time Code Design for Near-Capacity Cooperative Communications,2009,"This paper presents an Irregular Distributed Space- Time (Ir-DST) coding scheme designed for near-capacity cooperative communications. A serial concatenated scheme comprising an IRregular Convolutional Code (IRCC), a recursive Unity-Rate Code (URC) and a Space-Time Block Code (STBC) was designed for the sake of approaching the corresponding source-to-relay link capacity, where the IRCC was optimized with the aid of EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts which was used at the source node. At the relay node, another IRCC is concatenated serially with an identical STBC. The relay's IRCC is re-optimized based on EXIT chart analysis for the sake of approaching the relay network's capacity, before transmitting the relayed information. We will demonstrate that the topology of the Ir-DST system coincides with that of a Distributed Turbo Code (DTC). At the destination node, a novel three-stage iterative decoding scheme is constructed in order to achieve decoding convergence to an infinitesimally low Bit Error Ratio (BER). Finally, it is shown that our joint source-and-relay mode design based on EXIT chart analysis is capable of near-capacity cooperative communications."
1420731,21212,369,On the Achievable Rates of Memoryless Two-Way Relay Channels,2013,"Amplify-and-forward (AF) and demodulate-and-forward (DMF) can be effectively used in memoryless two-way relay channels (TWRCs) to enhance the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we study AF and DMF, in terms of their achievable data exchange rate, for a memoryless TWRC. Our results show that unlike memoryless one-way relaying, increasing users' SNR benefits AF more than DMF. Another interesting observation is that while with DMF a higher data rate is provided for the user whose channel condition is better, with AF the situation is the reverse. That is, the user with worse channel condition can receive at a higher data rate. Further, we find that for a TWRC with asymmetric users' channels, AF can take advantage of power back-off at the users, without degrading the data rate, to improve the energy efficiency while power back-off is not beneficial for DMF."
2967564,21212,8228,Interference management in heterogeneous network,2012,"Inter-cell interference is the main factor influencing performance in future cellular mobile systems. Interference management has become an important issue in system design, especially in heterogeneous networks since interference is more severe. To combat the interference, coordination between cells in heterogeneous network is considered. According to the quality of backhaul link, coordination can be implemented semi-statically or dynamically. By semi-static coordination, time-frequency resources and spatial resources used for transmission are coordinated. To achieve better coordination result, dynamic coordination can be operated if backhaul quality is sufficient. A hybrid approach of semi-static and dynamic coordination is proposed to take advantages of both sides. An efficient algorithm is given to find suboptimal solution to the complex optimization problem for the dynamic part of the hybrid approach. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution."
360256,21212,369,List Stack Detection with Reduced Search Space for MIMO Communication Systems,2006,"The interest in near-ML detection algorithms for Multiple-Input/ lMultiple-Output (MIMO) systems have always been high due to their drastic performance gain over suboptimal algorithms. Algorithms such as the M algorithm and the Stack algorithm yields near-ML performance while only requiring a fraction of the computational complexity of an ML receiver. While the Stack algorithm is computationally less intensive than the M algorithm for uncoded systems and hard decision decoding, the reverse is true for soft decision decoding as a candidate list is required to compute the soft metric. The M algorithm can easily generate a candidate list at no extra cost, the Stack algorithm, on the other hand, would require more iterations to generate the list. In this paper, we propose a modified Stack algorithm which have a lower computational complexity than a conventional one without sacrificing much of the performance of the algorithm."

With C-RAN architecture, centralized and coordinated baseband processing among base stations become feasible. This paper introduces LTE uplink CoMP joint processing — the principles, simulation evaluations, field testbed and test results. The field test is done with C-RAN field testbed which is built around Ericsson office in Beijing. Both the simulation evaluations and field test results show that uplink CoMP has great gain at the cell edge especially when there is interference, so it can be a good solution to improve the cell edge throughput of the LTE system."
1972984,21212,369,Improved MMSE Vector Precoding Based on the MBER Criterion,2009,"A novel vector precoding scheme is proposed for the downlink of a multiuser system equipped with multiple antennas transmitting to single-antenna aided mobile receivers. Our transmit preprocessing scheme first invokes a regularized channel inversion and then superimposes a perturbation vector to directly minimize the Bit Error Ratio (BER) of the system as an improvement to the well-known Minimum Mean-Square- Error (MMSE) vector precoding scheme. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vector precoding scheme acheives the same BER performance as the MMSE vector precoding at the same complexity, when only discrete vector perturbations are allowed. However, the performance of the proposed vector precoding scheme can be further improved based on the MBER criterion, when continuous-valued vector perturbations are car- ried out."
1657213,21212,369,Resource Block Assignment for Interference Avoidance in Femtocell Networks,2012,"In this paper, we investigate resource block assignment in femtocell networks. A resource block assignment algorithm is designed to avoid co-channel intercell interference and ensure service quality for femtocell networks with dense and random femto deployments. We first formulate the optimization problem as the integer linear programming (ILP) on resource block assignment. The goal of the optimization formulation is to maximize the overall utilization of resource blocks with quality of service (QoS) constraints. We propose an efficient and simple algorithm termed interference-aware resource block assignment (IARBA). By considering conditions of resource blocks, the proposed approach achieves better resource block efficiency and assignment within QoS requirements. Our analytical and simulation results show that IARBA not only provides interference-free resource block assignment but also outperforms existing schemes in terms of average throughput with comparable complexities."
