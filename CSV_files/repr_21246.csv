1024010,21246,9475,A compartment based model for the formation of 2-LTR circles after raltegravir intensification,2012,"Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) can suppress measured Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) plasma viral load below the standard limits of detection in most HIV-positive patients. However it has been shown that the virus persists at undetectable levels and rebounds rapidly when the treatment is interrupted. It has been hypothesized that the virus may continue to replicate efficiently in anatomical compartments with low antiviral concentration, so called “cryptic viremia”. Recent results from an experiment measuring the dynamics of 2-LTR HIV DNA episomes following intensification with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have provided strong support for the “cryptic viremia” hypothesis. In this paper we introduce a multi-compartment model of HIV viral dynamics including 2-LTR episome concentrations. These compartments represent an isolated anatomical location similar in structure to a lymph node, with diffusion from the plasma decreasing with distance from the plasma. We show that when the size of the compartment is sufficiently large to allow efficient replication in the most remote compartment, the dynamics of measured 2-LTR in the plasma compartment is consistent with the observed patterns in the raltegravir intensification experiment, providing support to the “cryptic viremia” hypothesis. The model presented could be adapted for use in estimating cryptic viremia dynamics from 2-LTR measurements."
1248921,21246,9475,NUROA: A numerical roadmap algorithm,2014,"Motion planning has been studied for nearly four decades now. Complete, combinatorial motion planning approaches are theoretically well-rooted with completeness guarantees but they are hard to implement. Sampling-based and heuristic methods are easy to implement and quite simple to customize but they lack completeness guarantees. Can the best of both worlds be ever achieved, particularly for mission critical applications such as robotic surgery, space explorations, and handling hazardous material? In this paper, we answer affirmatively to that question. We present a new methodology, NUROA, to numerically approximate the Canny's roadmap, which is a network of one-dimensional algebraic curves. Our algorithm encloses the roadmap with a chain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap and whose connectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. It starts by enclosing the entire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all sides and then split into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are detected in the shrink phase and removed. The algorithm terminates when all remaining boxes are smaller than a resolution that can be either given as input or automatically computed using root separation lower bounds. Shrink operation is cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is in turn transformed into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the Lasserre's approach. NUROA's success is due to fast SDP solvers. NUROA correctly captured the connectivity of multiple curves/skeletons whereas competitors such as IBEX and Realpaver failed in some cases. Since boxes are independent from one another, NUROA can be parallelized particularly on GPUs. NUROA is available as an open source package at http://nuroa.sourceforge.net/."
3005665,21246,9475,A brief and some further insight on the Exact Quadratization of nonlinear control systems,2016,"This paper aims to be, first of all, a short survey on the topic of the Exact Quadratization (EQ) of nonlinear control systems, mainly related to our article on the same subject recently issued (2015) in the SIAM Jou. on Cont. & Opt.. Secondly, it aims to yield some additional material, further improvements and new insights, not present or not enough discussed in the main σπ-systems, and a detailed description of the relationship between solutions of the original and quadratized representations."
2930582,21246,9475,Optimizing phage λ survival in a changing environment: Stochastic model predictions,2016,"Bacteriophages - viruses that infect and replicate inside bacteria - undergo rapid degradation outside their hosts. Thus, a common expectation is that phages will minimize environmental exposure by maximizing their adsorption rate, i.e., infection rate. Here we show that, while maximized adsorption is a good strategy when bacterial host cells are healthy, situations exist where bypassing hosts may be beneficial, such as when host cells are not productive for infection. In these situations, optimal adsorption rates may take on intermediate values, thereby increasing phage dispersal. We aim to develop a theoretical understanding of the intermediate, optimal adsorption rate for phage λ, in environments where changing conditions lead to either good or poor quality hosts. We develop a Markov chain model and define optimal adsorption as the adsorption rate that maximizes the probability of survival. We impose experimentally-achievable periodicity in environmental change and derive novel analytic results for the probability of phage λ survival, from which optimal adsorption is computed. We then discuss the sensitivity of the phage survival probability to relevant biological parameters and environmental conditions. Finally, we extend these results to approximate the probability of phage λ survival when environment change is random, which better represents of natural dynamics, and show that stochasticity facilitates phage λ survival in sub-optimal conditions."
861288,21246,8228,Weight based dominating set clustering algorithm for small satellite networks,2012,"Due to the size and density of small satellite networks (SSNs), the traditional clustering algorithms of large monolithic satellite networks are often limited. This paper proposes a novel distributed weight-based dominating set clustering algorithm to address the clustering problems in the stochastically deployed SSNs. Considering the unique features of small satellites, this algorithm is able to form the clusters efficiently and stably. In this algorithm, satellites are separated into different groups according to their spatial characteristics. Firstly, a minimum dominating set is chosen as the candidate cluster head set based on their weight, which is a weighted combination of residual energy and connection degree. Then the cluster heads admit new neighbors that accept their invitations into the cluster, until the maximum cluster size is reached. Evaluated by the simulation results, in a SSN with 200 to 800 nodes, the algorithm is able to efficiently cluster more than 90% of nodes in 3 seconds."
943563,21246,8441,On fixed-time performance of Lyapunov-based economic model predictive control of nonlinear systems,2013,"This work presents an algorithm for improved fixed-time performance of Lyapunov-based economic model predictive control (LEMPC) of nonlinear systems. Unlike conventional Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC) schemes which typically utilize a quadratic cost function and regulate a process at a steady-state, LEMPC designs very often dictate time-varying operation to optimize an economic (typically non-quadratic) cost function. The LEMPC algorithm proposed here utilizes a shrinking prediction horizon with respect to fixed (but potentially large) operation period to ensure improved performance, measured by the desired economic cost, over conventional LMPC. Closed-loop performance improvement is guaranteed by solving an auxiliary LMPC problem and incorporating appropriate constraints, based on the LMPC solution, in the LEMPC formulation at various sampling times. The proposed LEMPC scheme also takes advantage of a predefined Lyapunov-based explicit feedback law to characterize its stability region while maintaining the closed-loop system state in an invariant set. The performance of the LEMPC algorithm is demonstrated through a nonlinear chemical process example."
2066948,21246,8441,Efficient distributed sensing using adaptive censoring based inference,2013,"In many distributed sensing applications it is likely that only a few agents will have valuable information at any given time. Since wireless communication between agents is resource-intensive, it is important to ensure that the communication effort is focused on communicating valuable information from informative agents. This paper presents communication-efficient distributed sensing algorithms that avoid network cluttering by having only agents with high Value of Information (VoI) broadcast their measurements to the network, while others censor themselves. A novel contribution of the presented distributed estimation algorithm is the use of an adaptively adjusted VoI threshold to determine which agents are informative. This adaptation enables the team to better balance between the communication cost incurred and the long-term accuracy of the estimation. Theoretical results are presented establishing the almost sure convergence of the communication cost and estimation error to zero for distributions in the exponential family. Furthermore, validation through real datasets shows that the new VoI-based algorithms can yield improved parameter estimates than those achieved by previously published hyperparameter consensus algorithms while incurring only a fraction of the communication cost."
1130554,21246,8441,Topology design in networked estimation: A generic approach,2013,"In this paper, we consider networked estimation where asymptotic consensus is replaced with only one fusion iteration between every two successive steps of system dynamics. With this restriction on the fusion, we show that the topology of the communication network plays a key role in the observability (and the error stability) of the estimator. For arbitrary system matrices, algebraic design of the communication topology is challenged with (i) large-scale computation, and (ii) particular fusion rules. To avoid these, structured systems theory and the notion of generic observability are implemented, which are computationally tractable and do not rely on exact fusion rules. We show the stability under weak network connectivity as compared to strong connectivity in the literature. In particular, we do not constrain the system matrix to be generically full rank compared to earlier works and show that for system matrices with rank deficiency (in the generic sense), implementing only state-estimate fusion does not recover the networked observability; thus, output fusion is required."
2946069,21246,9475,Exploiting models of different granularity in robust predictive control,2016,"The use of detailed models over long horizons in predictive control can be computationally challenging. Furthermore, always-present uncertainty renders the use of such sophisticated detailed models over long time horizons questionable due to the resulting variability of the trajectories. We propose a multi-stage scheme that combines the use of models of different granularity - using detailed models for short-term predictions, while performing long-term predictions with less detailed models. Using projection and invariance properties for the different model complexities and the transitions between them, we show that this scheme is recursively feasible. In a simulation study, we show how two models of different complexity can be combined for steering a mobile robot through a landscape with obstacles."
1428314,21246,8441,Trajectory-based proofs for sampled-data extremum seeking control,2013,"Extremum seeking of nonlinear systems based on a sampled-data control law is revisited. It is established that under some generic assumptions, semi-global practical asymptotically stable convergence to an extremum can be achieved. To this end, trajectory-based arguments are employed, by contrast with Lyapunov-function-type approaches in the existing literature. The proof is simpler and more straightforward; it is based on assumptions that are in general easier to verify. The proposed extremum seeking framework may encompass more general optimisation algorithms, such as those which do not admit a state-update realisation and/or Lyapunov functions. Multi-unit extremum seeking is also investigated within the context of accelerating the speed of convergence."
1162822,21246,8441,Self-scheduled and structured H ⋡ synthesis : A launch vehicle application,2013,This paper presents a new application of structured H ∞  synthesis to tune self-scheduled controllers. Newly available MATLAB-based tools allow to tune fixed-structure linear controllers while satisfying H ∞  constraints. Moreover multi-model synthesis capabilities can extend their application to self-scheduled controllers. This technique is successfully applied to the attitude control of a launch vehicle in atmospheric ascent phase.
2978731,21246,9475,Boundary observer design for hyperbolic PDE in rotary drilling systems,2016,"It is well known that vibrations in oilwell system affect the drilling directions and may be inherent for drilling systems. Further, the environment complexity requires a minimum number of sensor variables. In this paper, for an oilwell drilling system, we present an adaptive observer design for a second-order Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with the usually neglected damping term. The design relies on the top boundary measurements only. From the Lyapunov theory and the backstepping technique, we develop an observer based control law for the one dimension wave PDE. We show an exponentially vibration stability of the partially equipped oilwell drilling system. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PDE observer based controller."
1615940,21246,8441,Near-optimal strategies for nonlinear networked control systems using optimistic planning,2013,"We consider the scenario where a controller communicates with a general nonlinear plant via a network, and must optimize a performance index. The problem is modeled in discrete time and the admissible control inputs are constrained to belong to a finite set. Exploiting a recent optimistic planning algorithm from the artificial intelligence field, we propose two control strategies that take into account communication constraints induced by the use of the network. Both resulting algorithms have guaranteed near-optimality. In the first strategy, input sequences are transmitted to the plant at a fixed period, and we show bounded computation. In the second strategy, the algorithm decides the next transmission instant according to the last state measurement (leading to a self-triggered policy), working within a fixed computation budget. For this case, we guarantee long transmission intervals. Examples and simulation experiments are provided throughout the paper to illustrate the results."
1750932,21246,8441,Model predictive control of an overhead crane using constraint substitution,2013,This paper describes a real-time model predictive control (MPC) scheme for an overhead crane subject to state and input constraints. The constraints are taken into account by means of a transformation technique which transforms the system dynamics with the corresponding constraints into a new unconstrained representation. This method allows to reformulate the underlying optimal control problem (OCP) of the MPC scheme into an unconstrained counterpart. The unconstrained OCP is then solved by means of a fast MPC algorithm that uses a finite number of iterations per MPC step in order to ensure real-time feasibility. Simulation as well as experimental results demonstrate the computational performance of the MPC scheme.
1517649,21246,8441,Polynomial approximation of optimal event triggers for state estimation problems using SOSTOOLS,2013,"This paper uses polynomials to approximate the optimal event triggers in state estimation problems, and efficiently computes the polynomial approximation with SOSTOOLS. From the examples under study, the polynomial approximation provides a tight lower bound on the optimal cost, and a tight upper bound on the suboptimal cost. The cost generated by the polynomial suboptimal event trigger is very close to the lower bound on the optimal cost. We also apply this polynomial suboptimal event trigger to an 8 dimensional 3DOF helicopter to demonstrate that one can efficiently compute the polynomial suboptimal event triggers for highly nonlinear high dimensional systems. To our best knowledge, this is the first time the suboptimal trigger has been applied to a system whose dimension is greater than 2."
2520480,21246,8441,Event-based Green scheduling of radiant systems in buildings,2013,"This paper looks at the problem of peak power demand reduction for intermittent operation of radiant systems in buildings. Uncoordinated operation of the circulation pumps of a multi-zone hydronic radiant system can cause temporally correlated electricity demand surges when multiple pumps are activated simultaneously. Under a demand-based electricity pricing policy, this uncoordinated behavior can result in high electricity costs and expensive system operation. We have previously presented Green Scheduling with the periodic scheduling approach for reducing the peak power demand of electric radiant heating systems while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. This paper develops an event-based state feedback scheduling strategy that, unlike periodic scheduling, directly takes into account the disturbances and is thus more suitable for building systems. The effectiveness of the new strategy is demonstrated through simulation in MATLAB."
1161187,21246,8494,Consensus in networked multi-agent systems via model predictive control with horizon one,2013,"This paper addresses the problem of consensus by using the model predictive control (MPC) with horizon one.

We also give numerical examples to show that the convergence speed can be significantly increased by simply adjusting the parameter in the MPC consensus protocols."

1451542,21246,21102,Cooperative and hierarchical fuzzy MPC for building heating control,2014,"A combined cooperative and hierarchical control structure utilizing Fuzzy Model Predictive Control (FMPC) for building heating is introduced. The structure comprises three types of Model Predictive Controllers (MPC): For different independent zones of the building FMPCs optimize the fast acting input variable fan coils (FC) while a global linear MPC optimizes the slowly acting thermally activated building systems (TABS). Cooperation between these two groups of controllers is guaranteed by an inter-sample iteration. This cooperative structure acts as master in a hierarchical structure, where the slave is a mixed-inter MPC (MI-MPC) in the supply level. While the cooperative structure ensures user comfort in the building, the MI-MPC optimizes monetary costs of heat supply. This structure allows for decoupled and independent modeling of FMPCs, simple incorporation of the coupling input TABS, and decoupled design of the supply level control. A discussion on stability and sub-optimality of the control structure is given. A simulation of a large office building incorporating disturbances of ambient temperature, radiance, and occupancy demonstrates the performance of the proposed concept. Index Terms— fuzzy MPC; TS-fuzzy system modelling; build- ing climate control; cooperative MPC; hierachical MPC. I. INTRODUCTION The application of standard control designs to large non- linear complex processes requires specific modeling tech- niques. One possible approach presented here is the division into smaller locally linear sub-processes with Fuzzy model- ing. This allows for application of linear control structures, and moreover, individual local sub-processes can be added or removed without affecting the model or controller parameters of the other sub-processes. However, if there exist inputs acting simultaneously on all sub-processes, the individual local linear models are no longer decoupled. In order to ac- tively compensate these input couplings an additional global controller is proposed. All controllers are chosen as Model Based Predictive Controllers (MPC), as it is an effective way to handle measurable or predictable disturbances, large numbers of inputs and outputs, and to cope with constraints, (4). The resulting control scheme is a hierarchical and coopera- tive Fuzzy MPC (FMPC) structure which enables a modular control design. Parallel FMPCs, one for each sub-process, optimize their specific output by considering the output of the global MPC as a known disturbance. The global MPC op- timizes only the coupling inputs based on a simplified global model and the known disturbances of all FMPC-inputs. The"
887226,21246,9475,Tracking control of direct-drive servos,2011,"Multi-objective optimization, data-intensive analysis and hardware-software co-design are the major challenging themes in the concurrent design of high-performance electromechanical systems. Direct-drive servos guarantee superior torque and force densities, efficiency, robustness, simplicity and other enabling performance quantities. Nano-, micro-, mini- and macro-scale axial and radial actuators exist in a great variety, e.g., from living organisms to various engineered electromechanical systems. Permanent-magnet actuators and servos are widely used in aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, energy, medical, power, robotic and other applications. The major goal of this paper is to report and apply advanced concepts in design and implementation of tracking control laws. These control laws are designed using the state transformation method applying the Hamilton-Jacobi optimization and Lyapunov stability theory. We design and evaluate high-performance drives and servos. Various servo-systems with radial- and axial-topology actuators are demonstrated and characterized by evaluating analog and digital tracking control laws. The studied direct-drive actuators with SmCo permanent-magnet arrays guarantee high toque density, high efficiency, reliability, fast dynamics, etc. The controllers designed guarantee stability, high precision and robustness. The high-frequency PWM drivers vary the voltage applied by changing the duty ratio of FETs. High-accuracy sensors measure angular velocity and displacement. Linear and nonlinear analog control laws guarantee superior performance, enabling capabilities, minimal complexity, simplicity, noise immunity, etc. The analog control laws can be discretized and implemented using microcontrollers and DSPs. The studied drives and servos are applicable in many applications, including hard drives, high-precision pointing systems, rotating tables, manipulators, etc. This paper examines and solves a spectrum of pertinent problems in design and implementation of enabling minimal-complexity control laws and controllers which guarantee near-optimal system performance"
1098783,21246,9475,Uniform and complex bids for demand response and wind generation scheduling in multi-period linked transmission and distribution markets,2011,"Power markets serving 70% of US load operate today on period-specific uniform price-quantity bids (UPQBs). However, UPQBs result in a poor representation of utility accruing to many multi period market participants. UPQB can adequately represent utility of consumption only under the restrictive condition that it is additively separable over time. In fact, the additive separability condition is particularly untrue for emerging smart-grid-enabled flexible demands with storage-like characteristics such as EV battery charging and HVAC. We claim that such types of flexible demand exhibit a utility of consumption related to a period-specific state variable - e.g. the battery charge state - whose dynamics are a function of past consumption trajectories. We also claim that wind generation should not be only credited for its energy bids; it should be also charged for the incremental reserves that the Independent System Operator (ISO) must procure to secure system integrity against bids based on volatile wind output forecasts. Appropriate debiting and charging rates equal the market clearing prices resulting from co-optimizing energy and reserve costs. We argue that flexible demand and wind farms that participate in the day-ahead market by submitting UPQBs are motivated to self-dispatch on the basis of energy and reserve clearing price trajectory forecasts. Since actual clearing prices may differ significantly from the forecasts used in the self-dispatch, oscillatory behavior can easily result if actual clearing prices are used as the next forecast. Nevertheless, a smoother price forecast updating process can lead towards Nash Equilibrium. The paper's contribution is the proposal of tractable complex bid rules that (i) allow market participants to reveal their true inter temporal utility of consumption and their net revenue from wind generation, and (ii) enable the market operator to compute the actual Nash equilibrium in a single solution of the market clearing algorithm. The tractability and reasonableness of the complex bid rules are demonstrated through numerical examples."
2625192,21246,9475,A geodesic feedback law to decouple the full and reduced attitude,2017,"This dissertation explores aspects of control in rigid-body and robotic systems. The first and second paper analyze the attitude stabilization problem and its generalization to n-dimensional rigid bodies. The third and fourth paper are on cooperative control design for systems that evolve on the n-sphere and related topics such as rigid-body reduced attitude synchronization. The fifth, and final, paper proposes a hybrid systems approach to task-priority based control for mobile manipulation.he first and second paper concern the problem of attitude tracking by kinematic actuation for a class of almost globally asymptotically stabilizing feedback laws on SO(n). The closed-loop systems are solved exactly for the rotation matrices as functions of time. Exact solutions provide insight into both the transient and asymptotical behavior of a system. Applications of these results are found in model predictive control and in sampled systems. The second paper also solves the optimal control problem of geodesic reduced attitude stabilization subject to full attitude stabilization.The third and fourth paper concern three cooperative control problems on the n-sphere with applications to reduced attitude synchronization and formation control. The global behavior of a consensus protocol is studied both forwards and backwards in time. The forward time stability properties of all equilibria are characterized for a non-trivial class of graph topologies. The reverse time behavior in the case of cyclic graph topologies results in two types of formations depending on the parity of the number of agents. A third control protocol renders the centroid of agent states constant.The fifth, and final, paper proposes a hybrid control approach to task priority based planar mobile manipulation, i.e., control on the n-torus. The end-effector path following problem for a nonholonomic mobile manipulator is solved subject to constraints on the input norm, feasible joint configurations, and distance to singularities. The hybrid system is well-posed; there is no Zeno behavior or chattering. A continuous, time-independent feedback law is derived based on the hybrid control design."
1092154,21246,9475,Preventing cascading failures in microgrids with one-sided support vector machines,2014,"Microgrids formed by a network of power sources and power consumers yield significant advantages over the conventional power grid including proximity of power consumption to power generation, distributed generation, resiliency against wide area blackouts and ease of incorporation of renewable energy sources. On the other hand, unlike the conventional grid, microgrids are compliant where a single load or a single generation unit can often form a significant fraction of the total generation capacity. Here large excursions from the nominal operating conditions are possible motivating the need for safety mechanisms which isolate power electronic equipment from damage. Breakers serve the purpose of protecting equipment from surge conditions by shutting off, for example, generation units. However in microgrids, a loss of a single generation unit can have catastrophic impact on the viability of the entire system. Here settings on breakers cannot be chosen too conservatively to protect the equipment at the expense of system viability or too liberally which will result in equipment damage. The ensuing problem of striking a suitable compromise tends to be combinatoric in nature due to numerous states of breakers which is further exacerbated by an uncertain load profile and nonlinear nature of system dynamics. In this article we provide a methodology to determine current thresholds and guard times, the time interval when current is allowed to exceed threshold value, for each inverter for fail-safe operation of microgrid. We employ a machine learning approach to address the problem where we first demonstrate that conventional support vector machine (SVM) methodology does not yield a satisfactory solution. We then develop a one-sided SVM method and generalize it to yield nonlinear support boundaries which captures the need for fail-safe operation against system blackouts while protecting equipment. A simulation engine is developed to model a real microgrid which is used to generate data for assessing and guiding our approach."
872615,21246,21066,Control over Networks of Unreliable Links: Controller Location and Performance Bounds,2007,"We address the optimality of control laws for networked control systems where sensors, actuators and controllers are separated by a network of unreliable links. We begin by considering the problem of controller placement and model the networked environment as an array of potential controller locations separated by identical lossy communication links (erasure channels). Our first result establishes that the controller should be placed on the 'shortest' path between the sensor and actuator nodes. The next result deals with where on a shortest path to place the controller logic. This problem is actually quite difficult since it involves consideration and comparisons of systems with non-classical information patterns which are known to be intractable, following the work of Witsenhausen. To nevertheless make progress, we begin by introducing a convenient 'long-packet' formulation under which each packet can be infinitely long and contain all past information from the sending node. Clearly the optimal cost under this optimistic assumption is a lower bound on any realizable cost. Although not implementable, its purpose is to lower bound cost in order to provide a baseline for comparison of other realizable schemes. Using dynamic programming we proceed to derive such a bound. The key insight is that the long-packets assumption permits a separation type result which features an interesting simplification that the cost to go depends only on a further simplification of the usual hyper-state. Finally, using a currently realizable approach we are able to upper bound the optimal cost and thus bracket the optimal achievable performance. We conduct simulations on several systems from the literature and some randomly constructed systems, as well as simulating currently proposed approaches. It turns out that the bounds are fairly close in many cases and we can deduce that the problem may actually effectively be solved for practical purposes in many systems."
1347036,21246,9475,Finite horizon optimal memoryless control of a delay in Gaussian noise: A simple counterexample,2008,"In this paper, we investigate control strategies for a scalar, one-step delay system in discrete time, i.e., the system?s state is the input delayed by one time unit. We allow control policies that are memoryless functions of noisy measurements of the state of the delay system. We adopt a first order state-space representation for the delay system, where the initial state of the system is a Gaussian and zero mean random variable. In addition, we assume that the measurement noise is drawn from a white and Gaussian process with zero mean and constant variance. Performance evaluation is carried out via a finite-time quadratic cost that combines the second moment of the control signal, and the second moment of the difference between the initial state and the state at the final time. We show that if the time-horizon is one or two then the optimal control is a linear function of the plant?s output, while for a sufficiently large horizon a control taking only two values will outperform the optimal linear solution. This paper complements the well known counterexample by Hans Witsenhausen, which showed that the solution to a linear, quadratic and Gaussian optimal control paradigm might be nonlinear. Witsenhausen?s counterexample considered an optimization horizon with two time-steps (two stage control). In contrast to Witsenhausen?s work, the solution to our counterexample is linear for one and two stages but it becomes nonlinear as the number of stages is increased. Existing tests for linearity of the optimal memoryless control consider only the two-stage problem. The fact that our paradigm leads to non-linear solutions, in the multi-stage case, could not be predicted from prior results. In particular, the fact that the optimal solution for the two stage problem is linear, but the multiple stage might not be, also shows that dynamic programming principles cannot be used for our paradigm. Our paper provides analytical proofs which hold for any number of stages."
1701407,21246,9475,CSS bode lecture: “Analysis and design of steady-state behavior for nonlinear feedback systems”,2008,"A long term goal in the theory of systems and control is to develop a systematic methodology for the design of feedback control schemes capable of shaping the response of complex dynamical systems, in both an equilibrium and a nonequilibrium setting. In this talk, we will focus primarily on periodic steady-state behavior, a phenomenon that is pervasive in nature and in man-made systems. We will begin with an analysis of the asymptotically stable oscillation in the classical voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), followed by an analysis of Brockett’s recent design of a feedback law which creates an asymptotically stable oscillation in a three dimensional, nonholonomic model of an AC controlled rotor with a constant steady-state angular velocity. We will show how to design feedback laws for stabilizable n-dimensional systems so that the existence, periods and stability of periodic responses can be analyzed and shaped when the nonlinear feedback system is driven with an arbitrary periodic input. This design is one application of a general theory developed, jointly with R. Brockett, for the existence of oscillations in a nonlinear dynamical system. The sufficient conditions use a multi-valued analogue of Liapunov functions, in much the same way as the angular variable in polar coordinates is multi-valued. For the VCO the angular variable is the output of an integral controller, while for the AC motor it measures the rotation of the magnetic field. In the general case, the sufficient conditions can be checked point-wise, just as in Liapunov theory, and therefore do not require the knowledge of the trajectories of the system or a cross-section for the dynamics. Moreover, these results can be readily used in the theory of output regulation to shape the nonequilibrium steady-state response of dissipative nonlinear feedback systems. Finally, using the recent solution of the Poincare Conjecture and more, we show these sufficient conditions are necessary for the existence of an asymptotically stable oscillation - a satisfying result in the spirit of the converse theorems of Liapunov theory."
1164905,21246,9475,Deadline differentiated pricing of deferrable electric power service,2012,"As the penetration of wind and solar energy into the electric grid continues to grow, there will be an increasing need to evolve demand-side solutions capable of compensating the inherent variability in power supply from such renewable resources. Today, demand is largely treated as inelastic. However, the power requirements of many commercial and residential loads are such that a fraction of power demand at any given moment is inherently deferrable in time subject to a deadline constraint on the total energy supplied. Examples include thermal systems such as refrigerators, water heaters, HVAC systems, data centers, and, assuming mass adoption of plug-in electric vehicles, batteries. In this paper, we discuss some limitations of dynamic pricing mechanisms (e.g., real-time pricing) as a means of inducing demand response and suggest a novel forward contracting mechanism for deadline-differentiated deferrable energy contracts to alleviate some of these difficulties. Essentially, consumers who consent to deferral of their consumption in time - subject to a pre-specified deadline - will receive a discounted per-unit price for said energy. In this way, the supplier is capable of extracting flexibility in the delivery of energy to participating deferrable loads, while consumers receive a discount on energy with an associated deadline guarantee on delivery. The supply side is modeled as random to capture variability in renewable power supply. Using a general model for consumer preferences to capture the effect of consumption deferral on utility, we prove the existence of a competitive equilibrium and provide a characterization of deadline-differentiated prices yielding such an equilibrium. We also discuss provably optimal online scheduling policies to dynamically allocate the variable supply to a bundle of deadline-differentiated energy tasks."
2968860,21246,9475,Power system state estimation with line measurements,2016,"This paper deals with the power flow (PF) and power system state estimation (PSSE) problems, which play a central role in the analysis and operation of electric power networks. The objective is to find the complex voltage at each bus of a network based on a given set of noiseless or noisy measurements. In this paper, it is assumed that at least two groups of measurements are available: (i) nodal voltage magnitudes, and (ii) one active flow per line for a subset of lines covering a spanning tree of the network. The PF feasibility problem is first cast as an optimization problem by adding a suitable quadratic objective function. Then, the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is used to handle the inherent non-convexity of the PF problem. It is shown that as long as voltage angle differences across the lines of the network are not too large (e.g., less than 90° for lossless networks), the SDP problem finds the correct PF solution. By capitalizing on this result, a penalized convex problem is designed to solve the PSSE problem. In addition to a linear term inherited from the SDP relaxation of the PF problem, a cost based on the weighted least absolute value is incorporated in the objective for fitting noisy measurements. The optimal solution of the penalized convex problem is shown to feature a dominant rank-one component formed by lifting the true state of the system. An upper bound on the estimation error is also derived, which depends on the noise power. It is shown that the estimation error reduces as the number of measurements increases. Numerical results for the 1354-bus European system are reported to corroborate the merits of the proposed convexification framework. The mathematical framework developed in this work can be used to study the PSSE problem with other types of measurements."
2120632,21246,9475,Quasi-decentralized state estimation and control of process systems over communication networks,2008,"This paper develops a quasi-decentralized state estimation and control architecture for plants with limited state measurements and distributed, interconnected units that exchange information over a shared communication network. The objective is to stabilize the plant while minimizing network resource utilization and communication costs. The networked control architecture is composed of a family of local control systems that transmit their data in a discrete (on/off) fashion over the network. Each control system includes a state observer that generates estimates of the local state variables from the measured outputs. The estimates are used to implement the local feedback control law and are also shared over the network with the control systems of the interconnected units to account for the interactions between the units. To reduce the exchange of information over the network as much as possible without sacrificing stability, dynamic models of the interconnected units are embedded in the local control system of each unit to provide it with an estimate of the evolution of its neighbors when data are not transmitted through the network. The state of each model is then updated using the state estimate generated by the observer of the corresponding unit and transmitted over the network when communication is re-established. By formulating the networked closed-loop plant as a switched system, an explicit characterization of the maximum allowable update period (i.e., minimum cross communication frequency) between the distributed control systems is obtained in terms of plant-model mismatch, controller and observer design parameters. It is shown that the lack of full state measurements imposes limitations on the maximum allowable update period even if the models used to recreate the plant units? dynamics are accurate. The results are illustrated using a chemical process example and compared with other networked control strategies. The comparison shows that the minimum communication frequency required using quasi-decentralized control is less than what is required by a centralized control architecture indicating that the former is more robust with respect to communication suspension."
2956529,21246,9475,A new approach to robust transportation over networks,2016,"We consider transporting a mass on a given directed graph. The mass is initially concentrated on certain nodes and needs to be transported in a certain time period to another set of nodes, typically disjoint from the first. We seek a transport plan which is robust with respect to links and nodes failure. In order to achieve that, we need our mass to spread over time on all available routes between source and sink nodes as much as the topology of the graph allows. The scheduling consists in selecting transition probabilities for a Markovian evolution which is designed to be consistent with given initial and final marginal distributions. In order to construct such a transportation plan, we set up a maximum entropy problem (Schrodinger bridge problem) for probability laws on paths which can be viewed as an atypical stochastic control problem. To achieve robustness, we employ a prior distribution on paths which allocates equal probability to paths of equal length connecting any two nodes namely the Ruelle-Bowen random walker (M RB ). The latter is also shown to be itself the time-homogeneous solution of a maximum entropy problem for (unnormalized) measures on paths. Since the optimal transport plan is computed via a Schrodinger bridge like problem, for which an efficient iterative algorithm is available [1], our approach appears also computationally attractive. We provide a few examples which illustrate the effectiveness of this method. While in this paper, we only consider strongly connected graphs, in a forthcoming journal paper [2], we show that our approach can be readily extended to not strongly connected graphs and weighted graphs. In the latter case, this strategy may be used to design a transportation plan which effectively compromises between robustness and other criteria such as cost."
1092269,21246,9475,LPV system identification using a separable least squares support vector machines approach,2014,"In this article, an algorithm to identify LPV State Space models for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems is proposed. The LPV state space system is in the Companion Reachable Canonical Form. The output vector coefficients are linear combinations of a set of a possibly infinite number of nonlinear basis functions dependent on the scheduling signal, the state matrix is either time invariant or a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions of the scheduling signal and the input vector is time invariant. This model structure, although simple, can describe accurately the behaviour of many nonlinear SISO systems by an adequate choice of the scheduling signal. It also partially solves the problems of structural bias caused by inaccurate selection of the basis functions and high variance of the estimates due to over-parameterisation. The use of an infinite number of basis functions in the output vector increases the flexibility to describe complex functions and makes it possible to learn the underlying dependencies of these coefficients from the data. A Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approach is used to address the infinite dimension of the output coefficients. Since there is a linear dependence of the output on the output vector coefficients and, on the other hand, the LS-SVM solution is a nonlinear function of the state and input matrix coefficients, the LPV system is identified by minimising a quadratic function of the output function in a reduced parameter space; the minimisation of the error is performed by a separable approach where the parameters of the fixed matrices are calculated using a gradient method. The derivatives required by this algorithm are the output of either an LTI or an LPV (in the case of a time-varying SS matrix) system, that need to be simulated at every iteration. The effectiveness of the algorithm is assessed on several simulated examples."
2394158,21246,9475,Discrete Empirical Interpolation for nonlinear model reduction,2009,"A dimension reduction method called Discrete Empirical Interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for unsteady and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. Empirical Interpolation posed in finite dimensional function space is a modification of POD that reduces complexity of the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of unsteady time dependent PDE and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of EIM in a finite dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the 1-D FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captured non-linear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results."
1029958,21246,9475,Pi-Invariant Unscented Kalman Filter for sensor fusion,2014,"A novel approach based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed for nonlinear state estimation. The Invariant UKF, named π-IUKF, is a recently introduced algorithm dedicated to nonlinear systems possessing symmetries as illustrated by the quaternion-based mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) kinematics modeling considered in this paper. Within an invariant framework, this algorithm suggests a systematic approach to determine all the symmetry-preserving terms which correct accordingly the nonlinear state-space representation used for prediction, without requiring any linearization. Thus, based on both invariant filters, for which Lie groups have been identified and UKF theoretical principles, the developed π-IUKF has been previously and successfully applied to the mini-RPAS attitude estimation problem, highlighting remarkable invariant properties. We propose in this paper to extend the theoretical background and the applicability of our proposed π-IUKF observer to the case of a mini-RPAS equipped with an aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) which leads to augment the nonlinear state space representation with both velocity and position differential equations. All the measurements are provided on board by a set of low-cost and low-performance sensors (accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers, barometer and even Global Positioning System (GPS)). Our designed π-IUKF estimation algorithm is described in this paper and its performances are evaluated by exploiting successfully real flight test data. Indeed, the whole approach has been implemented onboard using a data logger based on the well-known Paparazzi system. The results show promising perspectives and demonstrate that nonlinear state estimation converges on a much bigger set of trajectories than for more traditional approaches"
2177505,21246,9475,Trajectory tracking for non-holonomic cars: A linear approach to controlled leader-follower formation,2010,"This article describes the design of a linear robust dynamic output feedback control scheme for output reference trajectory tracking tasks in a leader-follower non-holonomic car formation problem using the cars' kinematic models. A simplification is proposed on the follower's exact open loop position tracking error dynamics, obtained by flatness considerations, resulting in a system described by an additively disturbed set of two, second order, integrators with non-linear velocity dependent control input matrix gain. The unknown disturbances are modeled as absolutely bounded, additive, unknown time signals which may be locally approximated by arbitrary elements of, a, fixed, sufficiently high degree family of Taylor polynomials. Linear Luenberger observers may be readily designed, which include the, self updating, internal model of the unknown disturbance input vector components as generic time-polynomial models. The proposed Generalized Proportional Integral (GPI) observers, which are the dual counterpart of GPI controllers ([11]), achieve a, simultaneous, disturbance estimation and tracking error phase variables estimation. This, on-line, gathered information is used to advantage on the follower's linear output feedback controller thus allowing for a simple, yet efficient, disturbance and control input gain cancelation effort. The results are applied to control the fixed time delayed trajectory tracking of the leader path on the part of the follower. Simulations are presented which illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach."
1589947,21246,9475,A decentralized ID algorithm for detecting slow-fast oscillations in power systems from overwhelming volumes of phasor data,2012,"As the number of sensors, namely Phasor Measurement Units or PMUs, in the US power transmission grid scales up into the thousands within the next few years, the current state-of-the-art centralized data processing architecture will no longer be sustainable, and decentralized algorithms must be developed instead. In this paper we propose such an algorithm for one of the most critical applications in power system monitoring- namely, modal decomposition of swing dynamics for detecting slow and fast oscillation modes in the system with evaluation of their respective damping factors. Given a multiple set of coherent generation clusters in the system, we first use data from all PMU sources to calculate the oscillatory modes, their damping and participation in a centralized fashion. Next, we categorize the PMUs into several disjoint sets, and use the data from each of these sets to evaluate the modal frequencies for the entire system individually, assuming that the network has a connected topology guaranteeing system observability. A global estimate for any specific eigenvalue of interest is then computed from the geometric mean of those obtained from the disjoint estimation, and analytical expressions are derived to indicate how this geometric mean, representing the ‘fused distributed solution’ compares to the centralized solution. A discussion on how the output nodes in the network should be chosen appropriately contingent on the topological structure of the network, in order to minimize the error between the two estimates is also presented. We illustrate our results with prototype power system network models inspired by two well-known transfer paths in the US west coast grid."
1269837,21246,9475,Flexible loads and renewable integration: Distributed control and price of anarchy,2013,"New sources of uncertainty and variability are being introduced into modern power grids creating new control challenges. Examples include renewable generation from solar and wind generators, electric vehicles, etc. In addition, there is compelling value in reducing the peak electric power demand as that has a direct beneficial impact of reducing the need for new capital investments in overall power sector. Introduction of new sensing, communications and computational elements offers opportunities for novel control solutions. One promising approach to addressing these problems is to exploit the inherent flexibility in many types of electric power loads and use that to accommodate the inherent variability in renewable generation and/or to reduce the peak demand. In this paper, we focus on electric vehicles(EVs) as flexible loads in the context of renewable generation. We take an intra-day time horizon where we assume we have a good prediction of renewable generation. Based on the supply schedule of thermal generators and predicted supply of renewable generation, the charging of the electric vehicles is controlled to minimize the imbalance between generation and consumption using centralized and distributed control algorithms. We develop a pricing scheme based on the proportional allocation mechanism for the distributed case. Assuming individual loads are price takers, we show that there is a time varying price which can be set by the control authority such that it's objective aligns with the individual's objective. If the users are price anticipators, the corresponding situation can be formulated in a game-theoretic setting. Distributed algorithms are developed to compute solution in both the cases. We also analyze the “price of anarchy” and show that the worst case loss of efficiency is 0.25."
1811042,21246,9475,Itô stochastic modeling for attitude quaternion filtering,2009,"A novel continuous-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) for spacecraft attitude quaternion kinematics with state-multiplicative noise and a novel continuous-time exact optimal quaternion filter are developed in the framework of Ito (mean-square) calculus. The quaternion Ito SDE contains dissipative terms that ensures the mean-square stability of the process. A closed-form deterministic propagation equation is developed for the second-order moment of the quaternion. Its dynamical properties are analyzed and a closed-form solution is found for the constant angular velocity case. The quaternion filter produces the linear minimum-variance unbiased estimate of the quaternion from continuous observations with additive white noise. The filter gain computations include coupled Riccati equations of the estimation error matrix and of the quaternion second-order moment. These computations are not estimate-dependent and can therefore be performed off-line. The special case of gyro error white noise with independent identically distributed components is considered. The case of correlated components can be addressed straightforwardly. Additive gyro biases are easily handled via state augmentation. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed in order to validate the Ito model and to illustrate the proposed filter accuracy. Comparative simulations of the novel filter and of a standard additive extended Kalman filter are performed both for attitude-only estimation and for attitude-bias estimation. For low process noise levels, the novel modeling and filtering approach shows results that are similar to the standard approach. For high process noise levels however, the numerical study suggests that the novel filter can increase the accuracy of a conventional Kalman filter by orders of magnitudes."
2227515,21246,9475,Distributed estimation through randomized gossip Kalman filter,2009,"In this paper we consider the problem of estimating a random process from noisy measurements, collected by a sensor network. We analyze a distributed two-stage algorithm. The first stage is a Kalman-like estimate update, in which each agent makes use only of its own measurements. During the second phase agents communicate with their neighbors to improve their estimate. Estimate fusion is operated by running a consensus iteration. In literature it has been considered only the case of a fixed communication strategies, i.e. described by a fixed constant consensus matrix. However, in many practical cases this is just a rough model of communications in a sensor network, that usually happen according to a randomized strategy. This strategy is more properly modeled by assuming that the consensus matrices are drawn, according to a selection probability, from an alphabet of matrices compatible with the communication graph, at each time instant. This work deals therefore with randomized communication strategies and in particular with the symmetric gossip. A mean square performance analysis is carried out and an upper-bound for the trace of the estimation error variance is derived. The proposed upper-bound has to be considered the main technical contribution of the present paper, since it is based on a highly non-trivial inequality on matrix singular values, proved in the appendix. This upper-bound is a good performance assessment index and it is assumed therefore as a cost function to be minimized. We show moreover that problem of minimizing this cost function by choosing the Kalman gain and the selection probability is convex in each of the two variables separately although it is not jointly convex. Finally simulations are presented and the results discussed."
2004505,21246,9475,A Unified information flow model of Poisson-type brain neuronal network activity,2008,"Understanding information transfer and representation in the brain is one of the most challenging scientific endeavors since neuroscientists are still far from converging to a solution with exact description. The main challenge in deciphering the neural code is the probabilistic nature of the neural codebook which maps stimuli to neural responses and vice versa. With the advent of recording techniques from single and multiple cells, it is becoming plausible to obtain large amount of experimental data against which theoretical models can be tested. In this respect, information theory can potentially provide a powerful framework for analyzing information content and representation in neuronal network activity. In this paper, we develop a simplified neuronal firing model which is mathematically complete and scalable. The model makes use of Poisson processes? properties and queuing theory. We also derive theoretical tools to measure, quantify, and set upper limits on information coded by the proposed model based on information theory. The designed measures take into account a general coding scheme in each neuron that combines temporal and rate coding of spike train responses of neurons. The proposed model along with the tools are generalized to quantify information in a population of neurons where correlation among neurons is modeled. The model also incorporates a spatial component which allows studying the amount of information gained from the spatial pattern of responses in a neuron population. Accordingly, the developed model and tools aim at providing a unified view of measuring information quantities and hence giving a better understanding of the neural coding."
2947965,21246,9475,Repeated games for power control in wireless communications: Equilibrium and regret,2016,"Game theory, as a powerful conceptual framework, has in the past decade or so been widely applied to wireless communications in a variety of contexts. One such context is power control, where a game-theoretic formulation is particularly well-motivated since the distributed power control paradigm makes it natural to treat each wireless link (consisting of a transmitter and a receiver) as a player equipped with its own incentives. However, much of the work on game-theoretic studies of power control has been focused on one-shot games, where the emphasis is placed on either characterizing the existence and/or uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium or dynamics for reaching that Nash equilibrium In this paper, we consider a repeated game framework for power control in wireless communications that captures the salient features of the repeated interactions between different wireless links. We present a unified presentation of both finitely and infinitely repeated games and discuss the interesting information structure special to the power control setting. We then consider in depth two classes of solution concepts: Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) and no-regret strategy. For the former, we characterize the existence and uniqueness/multiplicity of SPNE; for the latter, we take an online convex optimization approach and design a power control scheme that is no regret for a link (irrespective of what the other links do), with an explicit finite time regret bound. These two solution concepts not only serve the normative role (from an economic-theoretical standpoint) of explaining how the wireless links transmit power in repeated interactions, but also induce distributed power control schemes that enjoy desirable properties from an engineering standpoint. Finally, we study a special case (one with “good” channel conditions) where we give a different power control strategy that both enjoys a more refined regret bound and converges to the unique Nash equilibrium of the stage game."
1917109,21246,9475,Parameter estimation of discrete and continuous-time physical models: A similarity transformation approach,2010,"The fitting of physical dynamical models to stimulus-response data such as the chemical concentration measured after a gas has been released to the environment, or the plasma concentration measured after an intravenous or oral input of a drug, are important problems in the area of system identification. Using models of different structures, one can obtain relevant statistical information on the parameters of the model from an array of software packages available in the literature. A meaningful interpretation of these parameters requires that in the presence of error-free data and an error-free model structure, a unique solution for the model parameters is guaranteed. This problem is known as a priori identifiability. Once the model is deemed identifiable, the parameters are then obtained, usually via a nonlinear least squares technique. In addition to identifiability, there is the problem of convergence of the parameters to the true values. It is a known fact that nonlinear parameter estimation algorithms do not always converge to the true parameter set. This is due to the fact that estimating the parameters of a nonlinear model can at times be an ill-conditioned problem. In this paper we use the same state space analysis techniques used to determine identifiability, to estimate the model parameters in a linear fashion. We approach the problem from a system identification point of view and then take advantage of the similarity transformation between the physical model and the identified model. We formulate the similarity relations and then transform them into a null space problem whose solution leads to the physical parameters. The novelty of our approach is in the use of a state space system identification algorithm to identify a black-box system, followed by a physical parameter extraction step using robust numerical tools such as the singular value decomposition."
1518129,21246,9475,Turbulence modeling and Kalman prediction for the control of large AO systems,2013,"Measurements of large ground telescopes are affected by the presence of the terrestrial atmospheric turbulence: local changes of the atmospheric refraction index (e.g. due to wind and temperature variations) cause a non flat surface of the wavefront of light beams incoming on the telescope, thus degrading the quality of the observed images. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are of fundamental importance to reduce such atmospheric influence on ground telescopes and thus to obtain high resolution observations. The goal of the AO system is that of estimating and compensating the atmospheric turbulence effect by properly commanding a set of deformable mirrors. Because of delays in the closed loop system, the Kalman filter plays an important role in ensuring an effective control performance by providing good atmosphere predictions. However, the need of periodically updating the Kalman filter gain because of changes in the atmosphere characteristics, the increase of telescopes and sensors resolutions and the high sampling rate impose quite strict restrictions to the computational load for computing the Kalman gain. Motivated by the above considerations, some strategies have been recently considered in the system theory and astronomical communities for the efficient computation of the Kalman gain for large AO systems. Specifically, this paper presents some changes to a recently proposed procedure: the proposed approach, which exploits some results in the control theory of distributed systems, computes an approximation of the optimal gain in the frequency domain exploiting the spatial homogeneity of the system. Then, the control strategy takes advantage of some information on the turbulent phase dynamic, that is estimated from the turbulence measurements. Performances of the proposed method are investigated in some simulations."
2977774,21246,9475,Polarization in coopetitive networks of heterogeneous nonlinear agents,2016,"The mechanisms of regular cooperative behavior in multi-agent networks, such as consensus and synchronization, have been thoroughly studied. However, many natural and engineered networks do not synchronize, exhibiting persistent disagreement or clustering. One of the reasons for this “irregular” behavior is competition among some pairs of agents. Whereas cooperative interactions are usually represented by attractive couplings, bringing the trajectories closer, competition between two agents is naturally modeled by a repulsive coupling, leading to disagreement among the agents and preventing their trajectories from convergence. Such couplings may e.g. describe interactions of antagonistic individuals in social groups, competing economic agents and repelling particles. Networks where agents can both cooperate and compete are said to be coopetitive. To study the dynamics of general coopetitive networks, in particular, mechanisms of agents' splitting into several clusters, remains a challenging problem. A simple yet insightful model of polarization under coopetitive interactions was proposed in [1], [2]. These papers address consensus-type dynamics over signed graphs, where arcs of positive and negative weights correspond, respectively, to cooperative and competitive couplings between the agents. If the graph is structurally balanced, these protocols lead to either consensus or “bipartite consensus” (polarization): the agents split into two competing “camps”, and the values (opinions) of agents from different camps agree in modulus but differ in signs. The results from [1], [2] are limited to single integrator agents, interacting over static signed graphs. In this paper, we extend these results to time-varying graphs and nonlinear heterogeneous agents that satisfy a relaxed passivity condition."
1153080,21246,9475,Optimal frequency separation of power sources by multivariable LPV/H ∞ control: Application to on-board energy management systems of electric vehicles,2014,"In this paper a multi-variable LPV/H ∞  control approach is applied to design a strategy for power source coordination within a multi-source energy system. Three different kinds of power sources - fuel cell, battery and ultracapacitor - compose the power supply system of an electric vehicle. All sources are current-controlled and paralleled together with their associated DC-DC converters on a common DC-link coupled to vehicle's electrical motor and its converter. DC-link voltage must be regulated in spite of load power variations representing the driving cycle image. To this end, a MIMO LPV/H ∞  provides the three current references so that each source operates in its most suitable frequency range as either high-energy-density or high-power-density source: low-frequency, the mean power is provided by the fuel cell, the ultracapacitor supplies/absorbs the instantaneous variations of power demand and the battery operates in between the two other sources. Selection of H ∞  weighting functions is guided by a genetic algorithm whose optimization criterion expresses the frequency-separation requirements. The nonlinear multi-source system is simulated in MATLABP ®  /Simulink ®  using the driving cycle of IFSTTAR (Institut Francais des Sciences et Technologies des Transports, de l'Amenagement et des Reseaux) as load profile, whose frequency content is richer than the one of Normalized European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Simulation results show good performance in supplying the load at constant DC-link voltage according to user-configured frequency-separation power sharing strategy."
2018370,21246,9475,A case study on spacecraft attitude control,2009,"In this paper, we present a case study on spacecraft attitude control. The plant (spacecraft attitude model) is a second order, nonlinear, multi-input-multi-output system defined by Euler's equations of rotational motion and the kinematic differential equations. The Modified Rodrigues parameter (MRP) is used for kinematic parametrization and is the only measurable variable at the plant output. It is shown that the non-linear plant can be globally asymptotically stabilized by an output feedback control law proposed in the paper. Stability is proved by Lyapunov's theorem with a new Lyapunov candidate function. In the control scheme design method, the rate of change of the output (attitude) is approximated using a high gain, high pass filter located in the inner feedback loop. In this way, the proposed control scheme possesses the robustness and simplicity of a PD controller, but does not require attitude rate measurement, angular velocity measurement or direct use of differentiators. Furthermore, the control scheme does not require any information about the body principal moments of inertia and is therefore robust with respect to system parametric uncertainty. This makes the approach practically useful and acceptable by practising engineers. The simulations included in the paper show the robust performance and zero tracking error of the overall closed loop, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization approach. Finally, the paper includes a comparison between the controllers designed by the proposed scheme, by an H ∞  loop shaping design procedure and by a mixed sensitivity design, for the same given plant."
1307951,21246,9475,Bounded control based on saturation functions of nonlinear under-actuated mechanical systems: The cart-pendulum system case,2011,"We are concerned in this paper by bounded control of nonlinear underactuated dynamical systems. We focus our exposition on a feedback-based stabilization bounded control action shaped by saturation functions. A simple stabilizing controller for the well-known cart-pendulum system is then designed in this paper. Our control strategy describes in lumped linear time-invariant terms the concerned underactuated nonlinear system as a cascade nonlinear dynamical system consisted of a simple chain of four integrators with a high-order smooth nonlinear perturbation, and assumes initialization of the resulting underactuated system in the upperhalf plane. Our proposed feedback-based regulation design procedure involves the simultaneous combination of two control actions: one bounded linear and one bounded quasilinear. Control boundedness is provided in both involved control actions by specific saturation functions. The first bounded control action brings the non-actuated coordinate near to the upright position and keep it inside of a well-characterized small vicinity, whereas the second bounded control action asymptotically brings the whole state of the dynamical system to the origin. The necessary closed-loop stability analysis uses standard linear stability arguments as well as the traditional well-known Lyapunov method and the LaSalle's theorem. Our proposed control law ensures global stability of the closed-loop system in the upper half plane, while avoiding the necessity of solving either partial differential equations, nonlinear differential equations or fixed-point controllers. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy via numerical simulations."
2152786,21246,9475,Circadian system modeling and phase control,2010,"Circadian rhythms are biological processes found in all living organisms, from plants to insects to mammals that repeat with a period close to, but not exactly, 24 hours. In the absence of environmental cues, circadian rhythms oscillate with a period slightly longer or shorter than 24 hours. The 24-hour patterns of light and dark are the strongest synchronizer of circadian rhythms to the solar day. Circadian disruption resulting from lack of synchrony between the solar day and the internal master clock that regulates and generates circadian rhythms had been linked to a variety of maladies. Circadian disruption, as experienced by night shift workers or by those traveling multiple time zones can lead to lower productivity, digestive problems and decreased sleep efficiency. Long-term circadian disruption has been linked to serious health problems, such as increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Biochemical and empirical mathematical models describing the circadian clock and its response to light input have been developed by various research groups. Biochemical models describe the kinetics of the interaction between different proteins and may be of high order depending on the complexity of the model. Empirical models are based on nonlinear oscillators, such as the van der Pol oscillator, and are, therefore, much simpler. Though empirical models do not have a biochemical basis, it has been shown that they do represent the averaged asymptotic behavior of the biochemical models. In this paper, we analyze a simple empirical model proposed by Kronauer and colleagues and discuss how light control may be used to promote circadian entrainment. In contrast to most of the existing approaches, which are based on phase response curves, we propose a feedback-based system. Through simulation, we show that the recovery of a 12-hour jet lag can be shortened from 7 days to 2.5 days."
988158,21246,9475,Toward force control of a quadrotor UAV in SE(3),2012,"Two novel model-free second order sliding mode controllers are proposed for the constrained underactuated position and orientation dynamic model of the quadrotor, i.e., considering contact wrench, based on spring-like contact force model. The main theorem establishes conditions for the closed-loop system to guarantee semi-global exponential and robust tracking of position and admissible contact forces, with zero yaw, by exploiting the solution in SE(3). It is proved an integral sliding mode for all time and for any initial condition at a quaternion-based sliding surface. This yields a causal and analytical computation of desired angular velocity in terms of position control, without involving derivatives of the state. A second theorem is derived for terminal stability with desired finite time convergence. This in turns produces three results, a) a singularity-free representation under proper and easy to meet initialization; b) stable transition from free flying to constrained motion, and c) realization of the virtual position controller due to finite time convergence of angular tracking errors. It is noted that there arises an evident physical limit for force interaction along underactuated directions: the more interaction force along the underactuated axes, the more roll and pitch angles are needed the less thrust that can be produced to sustain the UAV in the air. Comprehensive simulation study is discussed under various flying conditions, and finally, the explicit (active) force control, based on a differential algebraic model, is briefly addressed."
964654,21246,9475,HJB-based optimal nonlinear control for multiple objectives in different levels of excitations,2014,"Linear control laws are the most common control strategies, primarily due to their simplicity in both design and implementation. While there are a multitude of accepted techniques for designing linear control strategies for mitigating the response of structures due to external loads and excitations, there are no elegant and widely-applied nonlinear methods. While the optimal linear control law that minimizes a quadratic cost function can be carried out simply with standard tools (e.g., MATLAB's lqr command), a nonquadratic cost function leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation that results in an optimal nonlinear controller. However, finding the exact analytical solution of the HJB equation is very difficult; it may only have a solution when the cost function is cast in a particular form. This paper suggests a particular form of a nonlinear control law for civil structures designed to minimize one objective (a serviceability and performance measure) for small excitation and small response, and a different objective (life safety) for larger motion. An analytical approach is presented to cast the nonquadratic cost function in a form for which the HJB equation can be solved. The resulting optimal nonlinear control law can be written as the sum of a linear term, which is related to an LQR problem and is effective in small excitations, and some nonlinear terms that dominate when the excitation level is large. The performance of the proposed nonlinear control strategy is demonstrated by a numerical simulation for a simple building model subjected to different historical earthquakes and a synthetic ground motion, showing that it can successfully achieve both life safety (drift reduction) and serviceability (acceleration reduction) objectives at different excitation levels."
2904156,21246,9475,Multi-automated vehicle coordination using decoupled prioritized path planning for multi-lane one- and bi-directional traffic flow control,2016,"Within the context of autonomous driving, this paper presents a method for the coordination of multiple automated vehicles using priority schemes for decoupled motion planning for multi-lane one- and bi-directional traffic flow control. The focus is on tube-like roads and non-zero velocities (no complete standstill maneuvers). We assume inter-vehicular communication (car-2-car) and a centralized or decentralized coordination service. We distinguish between different driving modes including adaptive cruise control (ACC) and obstacle avoidance (OA) for the handling of dynamic driving situations. We further assume that any controllable vehicle is equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors for environment perception within a particular range field. In case of failure of the inter-vehicle communication system, the controllable vehicles can act as autonomous vehicles. The motivation is the control of a) one-directional multi-lane roads available for automated as well as unautomated objects with potentially, but not necessarily, varying reference speeds, and b) bi-directional traffic flow control making use of all available lanes, allowing, in general, object- and direction-wise variable reference speeds. For the one-directional case, we discuss a suitable deterministic priority scheme for throughput maximization and quickly reaching of a platooning state. For the bi-directional scenario, we derive a binary integer linear program (BILP) for the assignment of lanes to one of the two road traversal directions that can be solved optimally via linear programming (LP).

The unknown, possibly state-dependent, additive nonlinearity influencing the input-output description, in terms of the tracking error dynamics, is modeled as an absolutely bounded, additive, unknown “time-varying perturbation” input signal. This procedure simplifies the system tracking error description to that of independent chains of integrators with, known, position-dependent control gains, while additively being perturbed by an unknown, smooth, time-varying signal which is trivially observable. The total state-dependent uncertain input is assumed to be locally approximated by an arbitrary element of, a, fixed, sufficiently high degree family of Taylor polynomials for which a linear observer may be readily designed. Generalized Proportional Integral (GPI) observers, which are the dual counterpart of GPI controllers (see [3]), are shown to naturally estimate, in an arbitrarily close manner, the unknown perturbation input of the simplified system and a certain number of its time derivatives, thanks to its embedded, internal time-polynomial model of the unknown, state-dependent, perturbation input. This information is used to advantage on the linear, observer-based, feedback controller design via a simple cancelation effort.

800830,21246,9475,Provision of regulation service reserves by flexible distributed loads,2012,"Following our previous work on the control of multiple appliances in response to Independent System Operator (ISO) Regulation Service Signals (RSS), we model the ISO's RSS dynamics - evolving in a time scale of seconds - as a two level Markov process whose transition probabilities are calibrated on actual data. Appliance response is modeled as a Markov modulated process consistent with an exponentially distributed time to switch off and an expected utility that is concave in the price charged when an appliance turns on. Prices are broadcasted dynamically by a Smart Building Operator (SBO) with the objective of maximizing the time average of utility gained when appliances turn on minus the cost of imperfect RSS tracking. We prove certain properties of the stochastic Dynamic Programming (DP) policies that allow us to formulate the problem as an approximate Discrete State and Control Space DP and propose a reasonable approximation that renders the problem scalable to multiple appliance categories. The discretized state DP solution can be obtained as a solution to a Linear Program (LP). The LP provides the optimal dynamic price control policies and in addition yields the requisite information needed by the SBO to bid optimally for energy and Regulation Service Reserve (RSR) Capacity in the hour ahead balancing market. Solving for the discretized real time market optimal price policies, using them to calibrate a continuous analytic policy function, and extracting from the real time optimal policies the optimal bid to the hour ahead forward balancing market is the main contribution of this paper."

959769,21246,9475,(Non-)Bayesian learning without recall,2014,"This work is concerned with the problem of social learning. A network of agents attempt to learn some unknown state of the world which is drawn by nature from a finite set. The sources of information available to the agents are their own private observations as well as the beliefs of their neighboring agents in the social structure in which they interact. The rational approach to the problem of social learning is for each agent to refine her opinion, by using the Bayes' rule to incorporate her neighbors' beliefs and own private signals over time. However, repeated applications of the Bayes' rule in social networks can become computationally intractable, partly due to the fact that each agent needs to use her local data that is increasing over time and make inferences about the global network structure. The inherent complexity of the Bayesian approach has lead to the consideration of behavioral, non-Bayesian updates, where each agent instead of processing all new information in the optimum Bayesian way uses simple rules such as linear or convex combinations and forms updated beliefs. In this paper, it is shown that by replicating the rule that maps the agents' common prior to their Bayesian posterior at the initial time-step for all future steps, one can derive a memoryless Bayesian update that has a log-linear format and can serve as a theoretical justification for some of the non-Bayesian rules suggested in the literature. Convergence and learning under the derived rules are also investigated, and it is shown that while two communicating agents always learn the true state, the beliefs may fail to converge in the general network setting. The proposed approach has the advantage that while preserving some features of the Bayesian inference, they are made tractable."
1621830,21246,9475,On stock trading using a PI controller in an idealized market: The robust positive expectation property,2013,"In a number of recent papers, a new line of research has been unfolding which is aimed at using classical linear feedback control in a model-free stock trading context. The salient feature of this approach is that no model for stock price dynamics is used to determine the dollar amount invested I(t). Instead, the investment level is performance driven and generated in a model-free manner via an adaptive feedback on the cumulative gains and losses g(t). One of the main results obtained to date is paraphrased as follows: Under idealized market conditions with stock prices governed by a non-trivial Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), a combination of two static linear feedbacks, one long and one short, leads to a positive expected value for the trading gain g(t) for all t > 0. Since this holds independently of the parameters underlying the GBM process, it is called the “robust positive expectation” property. Working in this same GBM setting, the main objective in this paper is to generalize this result from static to dynamic feedback. To this end, we consider a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller for the investment function I(t). Subsequently, we reduce the stochastic trading equations for the expectation of g(t) to a classical second order system and use the closed- form solution to prove that the robust positive expectation property still holds. We also consider a number of other issues such as the analysis of the variance of g(t) and the monotonic dependence of g(t) on the feedback gains. Finally, we provide simulations showing how the PI controller performs in a real market with prices obtained from historical data."
1629910,21246,9475,How useful are mean-variance considerations in stock trading via feedback control?,2012,"In classical finance, when a stochastic investment outcome is characterized in terms of its mean and variance, it is implicitly understood that the underlying probability distribution is not heavily skewed. For example, in the “perfect” case when outcomes are normally distributed, mean-variance considerations tell the entire story. The main point of this paper is that mean-variance based measures of performance may be entirely inappropriate when a feedback control law is used instead of buy-and-hold to modulate one's stock position as a function of time. For example, when using a feedback gain K to increment or decrement one's stock position, we see that the resulting skewness measure S(K) for the trading gains or losses can easily become dangerously large. Hence, we argue in this paper that the selection of this gain K based on a classical mean-variance based utility function can lead to a distorted picture of the prospects for success. To this end, our analysis begins in a so-called idealized market with prices generated by Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). In addition to the “red flag” associated with skewness, a controller efficiency analysis is also brought to bear. While all feedback gains K lead to efficient (non-dominated, Pareto optimal) controllers, in the mean-variance sense, we show that the same does not hold true when we use a return-risk pair which incorporates more information about the probability distribution for gains and losses. To study the efficiency issue in an application context, the paper also includes a simulation for Pepsico Inc. using the last five years of historical data."

We research design concepts and synthesize control algorithms to improve overall performance and enhance MEMS capabilities. Data-intensive analysis and coherent synthesis are accomplished by: (1) Examining device physics; (2) Deriving, validating and applying high-fidelity models; (3) Performing heterogeneous simulations, consistent experiments and sound evaluation; (4) Developing an adaptive performance-seeking design concept; (5) Implementing enabling minimal complexity control laws. It is possible to optimize performance and expand MEMS capabilities by designing sound closed-loop systems. The synthesized minimal complexity control laws ensure a near-balanced operation. Processing, controlling and driving circuitry with high-switching-frequency (~10 MHz) PWM amplifiers can be implemented by monolithic ICs. We control the duty cycle of transistors varying the phase voltages applied to the permanent-magnet synchronous minimotors. The results reported enable one to apply fundamental concepts to design high-performance mini- and microsystems. Complex electromagnetic, electromechanical and vibroacoustic phenomena are controlled and optimized in the behavioral domain. The experimental results are reported for proof-of-concept systems."
2632164,21246,9475,"Modeling, observer design and robust control of the particle density profile in tokamak plasmas",2015,"A new approach to real-time estimation and feedback control of the particle density profile in tokamak plasmas is presented, based on ideas from Kalman filtering and H∞ robust control synthesis. Traditionally, the density profile is reconstructed in real-time by solving an inversion problem using a measurement from a single time instant. Such an approach is sensitive to sensor errors and does not account for the dynamical evolution and spatial continuity of the density. The observer-based approach we presented here includes the system dynamics, which is realized by careful modeling of the particle density behaviour using a 1D PDE with a nonlinear source term and two ODEs, which are discretized in space and time to yield a finite-dimensional nonlinear model. The influence of other plasma quantities and operational modes on the transport dynamics are included in the control-oriented model as time-varying parameters. An extended Kalman filter estimates the density, additive random-walk state disturbances as well as fringe jumps (a specific type of sensor error) from measurements, for which special measures are needed. Offline reconstruction using tokamak measurements show accurate estimation of the density profile and show the quality of fringe jump detection. Moreover, a robust state feedback controller with anti-windup is designed based on the model to track a reference signal for the average density, with the estimate obtained from the observer. Closed-loop simulations show that the controller is able to track representative reference signals, with the performance mostly limited by the nonnegativity constraint of the control input."
2141841,21246,9475,Decentralized chance-constrained finite-horizon optimal control for multi-agent systems,2010,"This paper considers finite-horizon optimal control for multi-agent systems subject to additive Gaussian-distributed stochastic disturbance and a chance constraint. The problem is particularly difficult when agents are coupled through a joint chance constraint, which limits the probability of constraint violation by any of the agents in the system. Although prior approaches [1][2] can solve such a problem in a centralized manner, scalability is an issue. We propose a dual decomposition-based algorithm, namely Market-based Iterative Risk Allocation (MIRA), that solves the multi-agent problem in a decentralized manner. The algorithm addresses the issue of scalability by letting each agent optimize its own control input given a fixed value of a dual variable, which is shared among agents. A central module optimizes the dual variable by solving a root-finding problem iteratively. MIRA gives exactly the same optimal solution as the centralized optimization approach since it reproduces the KKT conditions of the centralized approach. Although the algorithm has a centralized part, it typically uses less than 0.1% of the total computation time. Our approach is analogous to a price adjustment process in a competitive market called tâtonnement or Walrasian auction: each agent optimizes its demand for risk at a given price, while the central module (or the market) optimizes the price of risk, which corresponds to the dual variable. We give a proof of the existence and optimality of the solution of our decentralized problem formulation, as well as a theoretical guarantee that MIRA can find the solution. The empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement in scalability."
1336193,21246,9475,Event triggered signalling codecs for molecular estimation,2013,"Low molecule numbers and intrinsically noisy, coupled stochastic chemical reactions are common in cell biology. For such environments, [12] showed that the accuracy with which molecular populations can be estimated and controlled can be bounded from below by regarding molecular coupling as an information transfer across a finite capacity Poisson channel. In conjunction with a diffusion approximation for the target species, this leads to a clear distortion bound for arbitrary signal-target molecular coupling. For static signal-target coupling, sharp, biologically relevant bounds result, which appear to still hold for the original discrete system. However, when arbitrary non-linear, dynamic coupling is allowed, [13] showed that event-triggered codecs can be constructed that are capable of outperforming the general diffusion bound, both for estimation and control. This paper extends the estimation results from [13] to various molecular signalling topologies and integer encoders. It is found that the bound can be outperformed across all serial and parallel networks by a M|M|1 queue type codec, which is likely optimal for a single stage, over a small parameter regime. Outside this regime queueing delay leads to increasingly worse estimation. The application of integer coding variants in an attempt to improve stability and increase the regime of good performance is largely fruitless, thus indicating that even the simplest non-trivial estimation problem cannot be solved with intuitively sensible codecs."
2998185,21246,9475,Stochastic games of end-user energy storage sharing,2016,"Deregulated electricity markets with time varying electricity prices and opportunities for consumer cost mitigation makes energy storage such as a battery an attractive proposition; users can charge the battery when prices are low and discharge the battery for activities when prices are high. Sharing a large capacity battery across a group of homes in a community, can not only alleviate the economic deterrents but also exploit the fact that users' activity patterns do not necessarily overlap. This scenario, however, induces competition for battery capacity between the users in general as they may want to maximize their own cost savings by occupying more battery capacity when the electricity price is low. A stochastic general sum game theoretical framework is proposed to capture the competitive behaviors of users sending messages to a common battery controller that manages the charging and discharging based on the received, albeit incomplete, information. With such a framework, we show that there always exists a non-stationary social optimal battery control policy - a credit based battery management scheme that ensures game theoretic equilibrium among all players. In this credit based battery management strategy, one user's access to the battery is strictly denied whenever he is found to give “abnormal” messages. This equilibrium control policy requires long time established observations and also “forces” users to share their energy demands accurately with the controller which leads to privacy concerns. We therefore, propose, a stationary suboptimal message blind battery management strategy which in the special case that the unforeseeable component of users' demands is i.i.d., we demonstrate is optimal. For the general non iid model, we demonstrate numerically using real electricity and pricing data, that such battery management strategy can provide a close performance to the optimal credit based battery management strategy using real electricity usage and pricing data."
1522308,21246,9475,Building temperature control with adaptive feedforward,2013,"A common approach to the modeling of temperature evolution in a multi-zone building is to use thermal resistance and capacitance to model zone and wall dynamics. The resulting thermal network may be represented as an undirected graph. The thermal capacitances are the nodes in the graph, connected by thermal resistances as links. The temperature measurements and temperature control elements (heating and cooling) in this lumped model are collocated. As a result, the input/output system is strictly passive and any passive output feedback controller may be used to improve the transient and steady state performance without affecting the closed loop stability. The storage functions associated with passive systems may be used to construct a Lyapunov function, to demonstrate closed loop stability and motivate the construction of an adaptive feedforward control to compensate for the variation of the ambient temperature and zone heat loads (due to changing occupancy). The approach lends itself naturally to an inner-outer loop control architecture where the inner loop is designed for stability, while the outer loop balances between temperature specification and power consumption. Energy efficiency consideration may be added by adjusting the target zone temperature based on user preference and energy usage. The initial analysis uses zone heating/cooling as input, but the approach may be extended to more general model where the zonal mass flow rate is the control variable. A four-room example with realistic ambient temperature variation is included to illustrate the performance of the proposed passivity based control strategy."
1872151,21246,9475,A robust MPC/ISM hierarchical multi-loop control scheme for robot manipulators,2013,"In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical multi-loop control scheme aimed at solving motion control problems for robot manipulators. The kernel of the proposed control scheme is the inverse dynamics-based feedback linearized robotic MIMO system. A first loop is closed relying on an Integral Sliding Mode (ISM) controller, so that matched disturbances and uncertain terms due to unmodelled dynamics, which are not rejected by the inverse dynamics approach, are suitably compensated. An external loop based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimizes the evolution of the controlled system in the respect of state and input constraints. The motivation for using ISM, apart from its property of providing robustness to the scheme in front of a significant class of uncertainties, is also given by its capability of enforcing sliding modes of the controlled system since the initial time instant, which is a clear advantage in the considered case, allowing one to solve the model predictive control optimization problem relying on a set of linearized decoupled SISO systems which are not affected by uncertain terms. As a consequence, a standard MPC can be used and the resulting control scheme is characterized by a low computational load with respect to conventional nonlinear robust solutions. The verification and the validation of our proposal have been carried out with satisfactory results in simulation, relying on a model of an industrial robot manipulator with injected noise, to better emulate a realistic set up. Both the model and the noise have been identified on the basis of real data."
1995394,21246,9475,"Detection, isolation and management of actuator faults in parabolic PDEs under uncertainty and constraints",2007,"This paper presents a methodology for the design of integrated robust fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) architecture for transport- reaction processes modeled by nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with time-varying uncertain variables, actuator constraints and faults. The design is based on an approximate, finite-dimensional system that captures the dominant dynamic modes of the PDE. Initially, an invertible coordinate transformation, obtained with judicious actuator placement, is used to transform the approximate system into an equivalent form where the evolution of each dominant mode is excited directly by only one actuator and decoupled from the rest. For each mode, a robustly stabilizing bounded feedback controller that achieves an arbitrary degree of asymptotic attenuation of the effect of uncertainty is then synthesized and its constrained stability region is explicitly characterized in terms of the constraints, actuator locations and the size of uncertainty. A key idea in the controller synthesis is to shape the healthy closed-loop response of each mode in a prescribed fashion that decouples the effects of uncertainty and other modes on its dynamics, thus allowing (1) the derivation of performance-based FDI rules for each actuator, and (2) an explicit characterization of the state-space regions where FDI can be performed under uncertainty and constraints. Following FDI, a switching law is derived to orchestrate actuator reconfiguration in a way that preserves robust closed- loop stability. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated using a diffusion-reaction process example."
2326090,21246,9475,Modeling and control of the heart left ventricle supported with a rotary assist device,2008,"A rotary left ventricular assist device (RLVAD) is a mechanical pump implanted in patients with congestive heart failure to assist their left ventricle in pumping blood through the circulatory system. This blood pump is controlled by varying the rotor speed to adjust the amount of blood flow pumped into the circulatory system. If the patient is in a health care facility, the pump speed can be adjusted manually by a trained clinician to meet the patient?s blood needs depending on his or her activity level. However, an important challenge facing the increased use of the RLVAD is the desire to allow the patient to return home. The development of an appropriate feedback controller that is capable of automatically adjusting the pump speed is therefore a crucial step in meeting this challenge. In order to be able to develop such a controller an appropriate dynamic mathematical model of the combined cardiovascular system and RLVAD must first be developed. In this paper, we review progress on a state space model for this system that can be used to develop the controller. The model is 6th order, nonlinear, and time-varying and is a combination of a 5th order model of the left ventricle and circulatory system and a 1st order model of the RLVAD along with its inlet and outlet cannulae. The entire combined system is controlled by the rotational speed of the pump. Using this model we will discuss some of the challenges faced in the development of a useful feedback controller for this system. We will also present some preliminary results on a simple partial state feedback controller whose purpose is to prevent the occurrence of a dangerous phenomenon called ventricular suction."
2988154,21246,9475,SLAM pose-graph robustification via multi-scale Heat-Kernel analysis,2016,"The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem (SLAM) in robotics is typically modeled as a dyadic graph of relative pose measurements taken by the robot. The graph nodes store the values representing the absolute pose of the robot at a given point of time. An edge connecting two nodes represents robot movement and it stores the measurements taken by the robot sensor while moving between two nodes. The objective of the SLAM problem is to find the optimal global measurements best satisfying the noisy relative measurements [12]. This problem of optimal estimation on a graph given relative measurements is a well-studied problem within the control community, for which several results and algorithms are known [3, 4]. SLAM is generally solved as a least squares problem. Robust kernels which are less sensitive to outliers are used to deal with noise and outlier measurements. However, robust kernels tend to be dependent on initialization and can fail as the number of outliers increase. Therefore, it's important to identify and prune the outlier (noisy) measurements represented by incorrect loop closure edges for an accurate pose estimate. In this paper we propose a multi-scale Heat-Kernel analysis based loop closure edge pruning algorithm for the SLAM graph. We show that compared to other pruning algorithms, our algorithm has a substantially higher precision and recall when compared and is able to handle a large amount of outlier measurements.We have corroborated results on several publicly available datasets and several types of noise. Our algorithm is not restricted to SLAM graphs only, but has a much wider applicability to other types of geometric graphs."
2410594,21246,9475,A linear reaction technique for dynamic asset allocation in the presence of transaction costs,2008,"Institutional investors manage their strategic mix of asset classes over time to achieve favorable returns in spite of uncertainties. A fundamental issue in this context is to maintain risk under control while achieving the desired return targets. When the asset mix is to be re-balanced many times over the investment horizon, the decision maker faces a rather difficult constrained dynamic optimization problem that should take into account conditional decisions based on future market behavior. This problem is usually solved approximately using scenario-based stochastic programming: a technique that suffers from serious problems of numerical complexity due to the intrinsic combinatorial nature of scenario trees. In this paper, we present a novel and computationally efficient approach to constrained discrete-time dynamic asset allocation over multiple periods. This technique is able to control portfolio expectation and variance at both final and intermediate stages of the decision horizon, and may account for proportional transaction costs and intertemporal dependence of the return process. A key feature of the proposed method is the introduction of a linearly-parameterized class of feedback reaction functions, which permits to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the portfolio statistics over time. These expressions are proved to be convex in the decision parameters, hence the multi-stage problem is formulated and solved by means of efficient tools for quadratic or second-order-cone convex programming."
2450482,21246,9475,Hierarchical interface-based supervisory control with data events,2007,"Hierarchical Interface-based supervisory control (HISC) decomposes a discrete-event system (DES) into a high-level subsystem which communicates with n ges1 low-level subsystems, through separate interfaces which restrict the interaction of the subsystems. It provides a set of local conditions that can be used to verify global conditions such as nonblocking and controllability. As each clause of the definition can be verified using a single subsystem, the complete system model never needs to be stored in memory, offering potentially significant savings in computational resources. In this paper, we extend the range of the behavior of low- levels that interfaces can model by adding a new type of event, low data events, and by relaxing some restrictions in the HISC definitions. This allows us to have (i) request events that don't need to be followed by an answer event, (ii) to start a low-level on a task and then poll it for completion, (iii) to be able to send additional commands while a low-level is already processing a command (iv) to model low-levels that behave as buffers, and (v) to allow unsolicited information (status etc.) to be sent up from a low-level. Besides greatly enriching the behavior that can be modelled as interfaces and thus expanding the systems that HISC can effectively be applied to, the changes can enable behavior to be moved from the high-level to the low-levels. We demonstrate this when we discuss the application of our method to a large manufacturing system example based upon the AIP example, where we saw a 4.8 times reduction in computation time and a 6.5 times reduction in memory use. This helps prevent the high-level from growing too large, allowing the HISC method to apply to larger systems."
1526711,21246,9475,Duration-differentiated energy services with a continuum of loads,2014,"The problem of balancing supply and demand in the power grid becomes more challenging with the integration of uncertain and intermittent renewable supply. The usual scheme of supply following load may not be appropriate for large penetration levels of renewable supply. The reason is the increased level of reserves required to maintain a reliable grid, which affects both operational costs (reserves are expensive) and the environmental benefits of renewables (on-line reserves might increase CO 2  emissions). An alternative paradigm is to use demand side flexibility for power balance. In this paper, we focus on one particular way of exploiting the demand side flexibility. We consider a group of loads with each load requiring a constant power level for a specified duration within an operational period. The loads are differentiated in terms of the duration of service they require. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the power delivery may occur at any subset of the total operational period. We consider the problems of scheduling, control and market implementation for a continuum of these loads. If the loads and the available power are known in advance, we find conditions under which the available power can service all the loads, and we describe an algorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available supply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be purchased to service the loads. In addition, we investigate the implementation of a forward market in which consumers can purchase duration differentiated services. We first characterize the social welfare maximization problem and then show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium in this forward market."
870700,21246,9475,Persistent patrol with limited-range on-board sensors,2010,"We propose and analyze the Persistent Patrol Problem (PPP). An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) moving with constant speed and unbounded acceleration patrols a bounded region of the plane where localized incidents occur according to a renewal process with known time intensity and spatial distribution. The UAV can detect incidents using on-board sensors with a limited visibility radius. We want to minimize the expected waiting time between the occurrence of an incident, and the time that it is detected. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable expected detection time of any patrol policy in the limit as the visibility radius goes to zero. Second, we present the Biased Tile Sweep policy whose upper bound shows i) the lower bound's tightness, ii) the policy's asymptotic optimality, and iii) that the desired spatial distribution of the searching vehicle's position is proportional to the square root of the underlying spatial distribution of incidents it must find. Third, we present two online policies: i) a policy whose performance is provably within a constant factor of the optimal called TSP Sampling, ii) and the TSP Sampling with Receding Horizon heuristically yielding better performance than the former in practice. Fourth, we present a decision-theoretic approach to the PPP that attempts to solve for optimal policies offline. In addition, we use numerical experiments to compare performance of the four approaches and suggest suitable operational scenarios for each one."
2928877,21246,9475,Scalable lazy SMT-based motion planning,2016,"We present a scalable robot motion planning algorithm for reach-avoid problems. We assume a discrete-time, linear model of the robot dynamics and a workspace described by a set of obstacles and a target region, where both the obstacles and the region are polyhedra. Our goal is to construct a trajectory, and the associated control strategy, that steers the robot from its initial point to the target while avoiding obstacles. Differently from previous approaches, based on the discretization of the continuous state space or uniform discretization of the workspace, our approach, inspired by the lazy satisfiability modulo theory paradigm, decomposes the planning problem into smaller subproblems, which can be efficiently solved using specialized solvers. At each iteration, we use a coarse, obstacle-based discretization of the workspace to obtain candidate high-level, discrete plans that solve a set of Boolean constraints, while completely abstracting the low-level continuous dynamics. The feasibility of the proposed plans is then checked via a convex program, under constraints on both the system dynamics and the control inputs, and new candidate plans are generated until a feasible one is found. To achieve scalability, we show how to generate succinct explanations for the infeasibility of a discrete plan by exploiting a relaxation of the convex program that allows detecting the earliest possible occurrence of an infeasible transition between workspace regions. Simulation results show that our algorithm favorably compares with state-of-the-art techniques and scales well for complex systems, including robot dynamics with up to 50 continuous states."
2555537,21246,9475,Distributed control of loss network systems: Independent subnetwork behaviour in infinite networks,2007,"Call admission and routing control of loss (circuit- switched) networks can be formulated as optimal stochastic control (OSC) problems in case of a class of integral cost functions. The resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for such OSC problems consists of a collection of coupled first order PDEs linked by sets of integral coefficients. Unfortunately, the implementation of optimal control laws even for medium size systems is not feasible since the computational complexity of the HJB equations increases exponentially with network size. In this paper, we study admission control problems for a specific class of radial network systems composed of a group of weakly coupled subnetwork systems. We delineate the so-called (asymptotic) subnetwork (stochastic state) independence property as the network size goes to infinity. In particular this implies that the acceptance of incoming and outgoing call requests are asymptotically independent of all other state processes of the mass (i.e. overall) system. Under the general class of Markovian feedback control laws, we show the basic property of asymptotic sustainability of independent subnetwork behaviour holds as the network size goes to infinity. Based upon this class of network system models, distributed OSC problems may be formulated whereby each subnetwork system implements a local optimal control. This methodology leads to an application of the Nash certainty equivalence (NCE) principle itself proven quite useful within the LQG framework in M. Huang, et al., (Dec. 2006)."
436878,21246,9475,Monotonicity of dissipative flow networks renders robust maximum profit problem tractable: General analysis and application to natural gas flows,2015,"We consider general, steady, balanced flows of a commodity over a network where an instance of the network flow is characterized by edge flows and nodal potentials. Edge flows in and out of a node are assumed to be conserved, thus representing standard network flow relations. The remaining freedom in the flow distribution over the network is constrained by potentials so that the difference of potentials at the head and the tail of an edge is expressed as a nonlinear function of the edge flow. We consider networks with nodes divided into three categories: sources that inject flows into the network for a certain cost, terminals which buy the flow at a fixed price, and “internal” customers each withdrawing an uncertain amount of flow, which has a priority and thus it is not priced. Our aim is to operate the network such that the profit, i.e. amount of flow sold to terminals minus cost of injection, is maximized, while maintaining the potentials within prescribed bounds. We also require that the operating point is robust with respect to the uncertainty of internal customers' withdrawal. In this setting we prove that potentials are monotonic functions of the withdrawals. This observation enables us to replace in the maximum profit optimization infinitely many nodal constraints, each representing a particular value of withdrawal uncertainty, by only two constraints representing the cases where all nodes with uncertainty consume their minimum and maximum amounts respectively. We illustrate this general result on an example of the natural gas transmission network. In this enabling example, gas withdrawals by internal customers are assumed uncertain, the potentials are gas pressures squared, the potential drop functions are bilinear in the flow and its intensity with an added tunable factor representing compression."
1165081,21246,9475,Nonlinear analysis of a grid-connected photovoltaic/dc-load system driven by local current-mode controllers,2014,"A distributed power generation system controlled through the duty-ratio inputs of the power converters used to interface a photovoltaic source and the ac-grid to a common bus is considered. For the control design, the standard local cascaded scheme is adopted for each individual input while nonlinear stability analysis is deployed for the complete system. To this end, a model integration is proposed that includes all the power system units along with suitable current-mode, inner-loop fast controllers. Taking into account some basic features of the complete nonlinear forced model, the analysis it is proposed to follow a new sequential method for proving stability. In the first step, an easily obtained storage function is utilized as it is constructed from the passivity property. In the second step, taking into account the cascaded system form, a complementary storage function is provided that substantially upgrades the initial storage function in a manner capable for proving input-to-state stability. Additionally, using an advanced LaSalle-based technique, convergence to the equilibrium is proven. Hence, in this paper, a novel nonlinear method is developed to prove that slightly modifying the conventional current-mode controllers these can be used in a decentralized local scheme without creating contradictions on the system performance since stability is guaranteed. Simulation and some experimental results are finally conducted to confirm the controller design and system analysis."
1530554,21246,9475,Recursive estimation of common partially observed disturbances in MFG systems with application to large scale power markets,2013,"Power markets are modelled as dynamic large population games where suppliers and consumers submit their bids in real-time. The agents are coupled in their dynamics and cost functions through the price process. Here, a common unpredictable partially observed major agent is added to the system which represents common unpredictable disturbance factors (e.g. wind) and exogenous market factors (e.g. competing energy resource prices), etc. In previous work, the Mean Field Game (MFG) methodology was used to study the limit (Le., infinite population) behaviour of large population market systems without a major agent; this results in a decentralized algorithm where agents submit their bids solely using statistical information on the dynamics of the entire population. When a major agent is absent, the system exhibits the standard counter intuitive property of MFG solutions that agents need not observe the behaviour (i.e., inputs and state trajectories, market price evolution, etc.) of any other agent (individually or collectively) in order that simple decentralized control actions achieve a mass ϵ-Nash equilibrium (with ϵ vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and individual L 2  stability. The contribution of this paper is the extension of the MFG theory to cover the addition of a major agent to the power market problem. In general, the addition of a major agent in the MFG framework makes the mean field stochastic in contrast to the situation with purely minor agents where the mean field is deterministic. In the general situation of sporadic noisy observations of the mean field and the state of the major agent, the extended MFG theory (with estimation of the mean field and the major agent state) yields simple decentralized control laws which achieve a mass ϵ-Nash equilibrium (with ϵ vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and individual L 2  stability. In this paper, this is carried out for the MFG formulation of the power market problem in order to fit the situation where sporadic noisy observations of the state of the major agent and of the market price are available for recursive mean field state estimation."
809820,21246,9475,Hybrid model reduction for compressible flow controller design,2011,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been a powerful simulation tool to gain insight and understanding of fluid dynamic systems. However, it is also extremely computationally intensive and thus unsuitable for control design and iteration. Various model reduction schemes have been proposed in the past to approximate the Navier-Stokes equation with a low-dimensional model. There are essentially two approaches: input/output model identification and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The former captures mostly the local behavior near a steady state and the latter is highly dependent on the snapshots of the flow state used to extract the projection. This paper presents a hybrid model reduction approach that attempts to combine the best features of the two approaches. We first identify an input/output linear model by using the subspace identification method. We next project the difference between CFD response and the identified model response onto a set of POD basis. This trajectory is then fit to a nonlinear dynamical model to augment the input/output linear model. The resulting hybrid model is then used for control design with the controller evaluated with CFD. The proposed methodology has been applied to a 2D compressible flow passing a contraction geometry. The result indicates that near the steady state used for linear system identification, the linear system based design works well. However, far away from the steady state, the hybrid system shows much better performance."
2652908,21246,9475,"A theory for the economic operation of a smart grid with stochastic renewables, demand response and storage",2015,"We are motivated by the problems faced by independent system operators in an era where renewables constitute a significant portion of generation and demand response is employed by a significant portion of loads. We address a key issue of designing architectures and algorithms which generate optimal demand response over a time window in a decentralized manner, for a smarter grid consisting of several stochastic renewables and dynamic loads. By optimal demand response, we refer to the demand response which maximizes the sum of the utilities of the agents, i.e., generators, loads, load serving entities, storage services, prosumers, etc., connected to the smart-grid. By decentralized we refer to the desirable case where neither the independent system operator (ISO) needs to know the dynamics/utilities/states of the agents, nor do the agents need to know the dynamics/utilities/states of each other. The communication between the ISO and agents is restricted to the ISO announcing prices, and the agents responding with their energy generation/consumption bids. We begin with the deterministic case for which there is a complete solution. It features a price iteration scheme that results in optimality of social welfare. We also provide an optimal solution for the case where there is a common randomness affecting and observed by all agents. This solution can be computationally complex, though we provide approximations. For the more general partially observed randomness case, we exhibit a relaxation that significantly reduces complexity. We also provide an approximation strategy that leads to a model predictive control (MPC) approach. Simulation results illustrate the increase in social welfare utility compared to some alternative architectures."
2167951,21246,9475,Partial state estimation for electricity grids,2013,"Power system operators rely critically on state estimation for verification, fault detection and localization, and re-dispatch under contingency operations. In current practice, power system data within a control area such as voltages, phases, real and reactive power flows and injections, are relayed to the operator using SCADA systems. State estimation is formulated as an over-determined weighted nonlinear least squares problem and the solver of choice is the Newton-Raphson method. Two critical issues are: (a) estimate quality, due to data latency or convergence to false local minima, and (b) computation time, due to the large number of state variables involved. In this paper, we explore techniques to accelerate state estimation by computing state estimates at a small subset of buses using limited measurements from the power subsystem of interest. These could be operator selected “important” buses which connect to “important” lines with significant real power transfer. Our techniques are inspired by uncertainty quantification methods. The influence of power flows from exogenous buses is treated as uncertainty which defines a feasible set of state variables consistent with available measurements. The state estimation problem can be cast as a non-convex optimization problem. We use a surrogate model relaxation and Shor's rank relaxation to obtain state estimates and associated error bounds at user-defined confidence levels."
751716,21246,9475,Cooperative navigation for heterogeneous autonomous vehicles via approximate dynamic programming,2011,"Unmanned ground and aerial vehicles are becoming crucial to many applications because of their ability to assist humans in carrying out dangerous missions. These vehicles can be viewed as networks of heterogeneous unmanned robotic sensors with the goal of exploring complex environments, to search for and, possibly, pursue moving targets. The robotic vehicle performance can be greatly enhanced by implementing future sensor actions intelligently, based both on prior knowledge and on the information obtained by the sensors on line. In this paper, we present an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to cooperative navigation for heterogeneous sensor networks. The mobile sensor network consists of a set of robotic sensors modeled as hybrid systems with processing capabilities. The goal of the ADP algorithm is to coordinate a team of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles (i.e., ground robot and quadrotor UAV) to navigate within an obstacle populated environment while satisfying collision avoidance constraints and searching for stationary and mobile targets. It is assumed that the ground vehicle has a small sensor footprint with high resolution. The quadrotor, on the other hand, has a large sensor field-of-view but low resolution. The UAV provides a low resolution look-ahead map to the ground robot which in turn uses this information to plan its actions. The proposed navigation strategy combines artificial potential functions for target pursuing with ADP for learning C-obstacles on line. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is verified through numerical simulations."
1784320,21246,9475,Nonstationary analysis of cerebral hemodynamics using recursively estimated multiple-input nonlinear models,2011,"We present a computational scheme to obtain adaptive non-linear, multiple-input models of the Volterra-Wiener class, by utilizing Laguerre expansions of Volterra kernels in a recursive least-squares formulation. Function expansions have been proven successful in systems identification as they result in a significant reduction of the required free parameters, which is a major limiting factor particularly for nonlinear systems, whereby this number depends exponentially on the nonlinear system order. We apply this scheme in order to obtain adaptive estimates for a two-input model of cerebral hemodynamics, where the two inputs are arterial blood pressure (ABP) and end-tidal CO 2  (P ETCO2  ) variations and the output is cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) variations, by utilizing long-duration (40 min) experimental measurements of spontaneous variations of these signals in healthy humans. Maintenance of a relatively steady cerebral blood flow, despite changes in arterial pressure, is critical in order to meet the high metabolic demands of the brain. This is achieved by the synergistic action of various physiological factors, which may vary over different time-scales and also exhibit nonstationarities. We quantify these nonstationarities for the two main physiological determinants of cerebral blood flow variability (i.e., arterial pressure and arterial CO 2 ) by considering one- (ABP) and two-input (ABP and P ETCO2  ) models. The results illustrate the presence of nonstationarities which are frequency-dependent and also that incorporation of P ETCO2  as an additional input, results in estimates of dynamic pressure autoregulation that are more consistent with respect to time."
1722439,21246,9475,Iterative fault tolerant control based on Stochastic Distribution,2011,"A new design of a fault tolerant control (FTC)-based an adaptive, fixed-structure PI controller, with constraints on the state vector for nonlinear discrete-time system subject to stochastic non-Gaussian disturbance is studied. The objective of the reliable control algorithm scheme is to design a control signal such that the actual probability density function (PDF) of the system is made as close as possible to a desired PDF, and make the tracking performance converge to zero, not only when all components are functional but also in case of admissible faults. A Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)-based FTC method is presented to ensure that the fault can be estimated and compensated for. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to approximate the output PDF of the system. Thus, the aim of the output PDF control will be a RBF weight control with an adaptive tuning of the basis function parameters. The key issue here is to divide the control horizon into a number of equal time intervals called batches. Within each interval, there are a fixed number of sample points. The design procedure is divided into two main algorithms, within each batch, and between any two adjacent batches. A P-type ILC law is employed to tune the parameters of the RBF neural network so that the PDF tracking error decreases along with the batches. Sufficient conditions for the proposed fault tolerance are expressed as LMIs. An analysis of the ILC convergence is carried out. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an illustrated example."
2333629,21246,9475,System identification of the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in gap junctional intracellular communications,2013,"Gap-Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (gap-FRAP) is a technique used to estimate functionality of intercellular connections in biology. Such a technique could potentially be involved in the diagnostic of normal/cancer cells. Discrimination of cell types may be performed directly, by comparing plots of fluorescence kinetics or indirectly by statistical testing applied to model parameters. This paper focuses on the latter model-based approach. Up to now, more than ninety percent of the models used to fit gap-FRAP responses have been derived from diffusion equations (partial differential equation). We propose to simplify the modeling procedure by using behavioral models derived from system identification techniques used in control engineering. To assess in practice the relevance of this concurrent method, two human head and neck carcinoma cell lines (KB and FaDu) were used. The former (KB) expresses connexin proteins (positive line) while the latter (FaDu) does not (negative line). Moreover, each cell line was tested on spheroid (3-D) and monolayer (2-D) slices and in vitro assays were repeated six times. System identification algorithms of the CONTSID Matlab toolbox were used to estimate the model parameters from the in vitro data sets. Results have particularly emphasized there is no need to use complex models to fit the observed gap-FRAP responses. We show that the static gain of the estimated transfer functions is able to discriminate cell types used in this study, which corroborates the relevance of system identification techniques for diagnostic applications based on gap-FRAP analysis."
847749,21246,9475,Voltage and reactive power control using approximate stochastic annealing,2013,"One of the objectives of smart grids is to optimize the performance of power devices to improve energy efficiency by utilizing additional data from smart meters. In particular, this is important for the transmission and distribution network, in which approximately 7% of the total energy generated is wasted. Efficient management of voltage profiles and reactive power in power distribution systems plays an important role towards this goal. In this paper, we consider voltage and reactive power control (VVC) problem with the objective to determine the proper settings of capacitor banks and transformer taps in power distribution systems to minimize daily energy losses. Voltage constraints and operation limits constraints on transformer load tap changers (LTCs) and shunt capacitors (SCs) are considered in our model. We propose a stochastic search algorithm called Approximate Stochastic Annealing (ASA) for solving this VVC problem. The algorithm searches the optimal control schedule by randomly sampling from a sequence of probability distributions over the space of all possible settings of LTCs and SCs. A Lagrangian RelaxationDynamic Programming (LR-DP) algorithm is also proposed to obtain upper and lower bounds on the performance of the optimal solution. Our testing results on the well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution network indicate that the ASA algorithm may yield solutions very close to optimum within a modest amount of computational time."
311561,21246,9475,Designing games for distributed optimization,2011,"The central goal in multiagent systems is to design local control laws for the individual agents to ensure that the emergent global behavior is desirable with respect to a given system level objective. Ideally, a system designer seeks to satisfy this goal while conditioning each agent's control law on the least amount of information possible. Unfortunately, there are no existing methodologies for addressing this design challenge. The goal of this paper is to address this challenge using the field of game theory. Utilizing game theory for the design and control of multiagent systems requires two steps: (i) defining a local objective function for each decision maker and (ii) specifying a distributed learning algorithm to reach a desirable operating point. One of the core advantages of this game theoretic approach is that this two step process can be decoupled by utilizing specific classes of games. For example, if the designed objective functions result in a potential game then the system designer can utilize distributed learning algorithms for potential games to complete step (ii) of the design process. Unfortunately, designing agent objective functions to meet objectives such as locality of information and efficiency of resulting equilibria within the framework of potential games is fundamentally challenging and in many case impossible. In this paper we develop a systematic methodology for meeting these objectives using a broader framework of games termed state based potential games. State based potential games is an extension of potential games where an additional state variable is introduced into the game environment hence permitting more flexibility in our design space. Furthermore, state based potential games possess an underlying structure that can be exploited by distributed learning algorithms in a similar fashion to potential games hence providing a new baseline for our decomposition."
838497,21246,9475,Developing proof carrying code to formally assure termination in fault tolerant distributed controls systems,2012,"We address the semantic gap between the model and the implementation of control algorithms for distributed systems in a formal fashion: we provide an interactive (partially automated) method by which to translate the global, model level theoretical properties, such as stability and convergence, into code level assertions and invariants which assure termination of the relevant implementations and validity of the result. We outline a simple flight control system example for altitude holding, and describe a fault-tolerant distributed agreement protocol among n processor nodes, in the presence of a varying network topology. We develop a Lyapunov-like function for the distributed algorithm, and attain a polynomial time theoretical bound on the convergence time T conv  ∝ n 3 . We then exploit the Lyapunov function and convergence proof, in order to derive requisite ANSI-C Specification Language (ACSL) annotations for the C code distributed implementation, in order to guarantee termination. The ACSL annotations can then be used to automatically generate formal proof obligations via the Frama-C tool. These proof obligations also encompass assertions relating to timing, memory allocation, type checking and processor specific issues. The proof obligations can then be automatically discharged using a theorem prover, and their success guarantees that the behavior of the corresponding distributed code will evince the global properties proven for the model. Thus, the verification process spans efforts from the high-level control theory to the low-level implementation as a C program."
2948179,21246,9475,Feedback stabilization of fluids using reduced-order models for control and compensator design,2016,"In many cases, feedback control of fluids can effect large energetic changes in the state while using relatively small amounts of control input energy. One such example is the stabilization of the wake behind a circular cylinder by slight rotations of the cylinder itself. For a range of low-Reynolds number flows, this can have a large impact on the drag and lift forces. To design such a feedback control law from first principles leads to large discretized systems and requires model reduction methods. The same is true for compensator design. While proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is the standard tool for controlling fluids, interpolatory model reduction methods (IMOR) have emerged as effective candidates for very large-scale linear problems due to their ability to produce high-fidelity (optimal in some cases) reduced models with modest computational cost. Furthermore, they don't require the expensive simulations needed for POD and are input-independent. In this paper, we will use the interpolation framework for model reduction of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) to develop a linear feedback control law and compensator design. We then compare IMOR with POD for producing a low-order compensator. We find that switching from IMOR to POD for this step can lead to a compensator that does not preserve the stabilizing properties of the linear feedback operator term. Numerical experiments using the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and stabilizing the flow behind a pair of circular cylinders demonstrates the effectiveness of retaining the IMOR basis."
2307139,21246,9475,Point process adaptive filters for neural data analysis: Theory and applications,2007,"Although it is well known that neurons receive, process and transmit signals via sequences of sudden stereotyped electrical events, called action potentials or spikes, many analyses of neural data ignore the highly localized nature of these events. We discuss a point process modeling framework for neural systems to perform inference, assess goodness-of-fit, and estimate a state variable from spiking observations. Under this framework, we develop state space estimation and inference algorithms by constructing state models that describe the stochastic evolution of the signals to estimate, and conditional intensity models that define the probability distribution of observing a particular sequence of spike times for a neuron or ensemble. Posterior densities can then be computed using a recursive Bayesian framework combined with the Chapman- Kolmogorov system of equations for discrete-time analyses or the forward Kolmogorov equation for continuous-time analyses. This allows us to derive a toolbox of estimation algorithms and adaptive filters to address questions of static and dynamic encoding and decoding. We discuss the application of these modeling and estimation methods to the problem of predicting an intended reaching arm movement from simulated neurons in primate primary motor cortex. We show that a Bayesian approximate Gaussian filter is able to maintain accurate estimates of intended arm trajectories."
2995978,21246,9475,A model of phenotypic state dynamics initiates a promising approach to control heterogeneous malignant cell populations,2016,"A growing body of experimental evidence indicates a strong link between intratumoral heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance in cancer. In particular, tumor cells may survive therapy by switching their phenotypic identities to more resistant, drug-tolerant states. Computational models of phenotypic plasticity in response to cytotoxic therapy are needed: (1) to strengthen understanding of the interplay between phenotypic heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance, and (2) to identify potential strategies in silico that weaken resistance prior to in vitro testing. This work presents a linear time-invariant model of phenotypic state dynamics to deduce subpopulation-level behavior likely to affect temporal phenotypic composition and thus drug resistance. The model was identified under different therapeutic conditions with authentic biological data from a breast cancer cell line. Subsequent analysis suggested drug-induced effects on phenotypic state switching that could not be deduced directly from empirical observations. A bootstrap algorithm was implemented to identify statistically significant results: reduction in cell division under each therapeutic condition versus control. Further, Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate quality of model fit for two-way switching and net switching on synthetically generated data to determine the limitations of the latter assumption for subsequent modeling. Most importantly, the simple model structure initiated a control-theoretic approach for identifying promising combination treatments in silico to guide future laboratory testing."
2287562,21246,9475,Cascade structural model approximation of identified state space models,2008,"General black-box system identification techniques such as subspace system identification and FIR/ARX least squares system identification are commonly used to identify multi-input multi-output models from experimental data. However, in many applications there are a priori given structural information. Here the focus is on linear dynamical systems with a cascade structure, and with one input signal and two output signals. Models of such systems are important in e.g. cascade control applications. It is possible to incorporate such a structure in a prediction error method, which, however, is based on rather advanced numerical non-convex optimization techniques to calculate the corresponding structured model estimate. We will instead study how to use model approximation techniques to approximate a general black-box estimate with a structured model. This will avoid the use of numerical optimization and works well with e.g. subspace system identification, which is a standard method in process industry where cascade systems are very common. The problems of cascade structural model approximation and model reduction are rather non-standard, and we will study several new methods. The basic idea is to first find a higher order but structured model approximation using standard H ?  model matching techniques, and then in a second step use so-called structured balanced model reduction to find lower order structured approximation. Structured balanced model reduction is a rather new approach, with powerful model order selection tools and error bound results. The results of the corresponding two step model approximation approach seem promising, as illustrated by a simple numerical example."
680188,21246,9475,A packetized direct load control mechanism for demand side management,2012,"Electricity peaks can be harmful to grid stability and result in additional generation costs to balance supply with demand. By developing a network of smart appliances together with a quasi-decentralized control protocol, direct load control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by directly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper proposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application to air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a fixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their preferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will determine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model to investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are proposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the PDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves that the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point with fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second theorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of all the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes an allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in theorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the theorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no control is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results."
2527718,21246,9475,Control of ramp-up current profile dynamics in tokamak plasmas via the minimal-surface theory,2009,"The central task of current profile control during the ramp-up phase of a tokamak discharge is to find the actuator trajectories that are necessary to achieve certain desired current profile at some time between the end of the ramp-up phase and early stage of the flattop phase. The magnetic diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) models the dynamics of the poloidal magnetic flux profile, which is closely related to the toroidal current density profile, and plays a key role in the model-based control synthesis. Given the initial and desired target profiles, splines are used in this work to generate evolutionary curves connecting their boundaries at both endpoints of the spatial domain. Then, a closed four-edge frame (initial profile, target profile, two boundary curves) in the three dimensional space (time, space, poloidal magnetic flux) is obtained without knowing the transient dynamics inside. The minimal surface theory is used in this work to define a surface spanned by the closed four-edge frame, which represents the desired transient dynamics for the poloidal magnetic flux. Then, the control task becomes a trajectory tracking problem. Once the desired transient dynamics is defined, the temporal and spatial derivatives of the poloidal magnetic flux in the magnetic diffusion equation can be computed, and the control-oriented PDE model can be reformulated into an algebraic equation where the control values at each time instant represent the to-be-determined unknown variables. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of this approach. This method is characterized by high speed computation and shows potential for real-time implementation in a closed-loop receding-horizon scheme, particularly for long-discharge tokamaks such as ITER."
1655993,21246,9475,On the identification of fast dynamics using slow rate camera measurements,2012,"This paper addresses the identification of the dynamics of a high bandwidth motion system using measurements from a slow rate integrative sensor. The motivation of this work is the need to characterize the dynamics of adaptive optics elements, such as deformable mirrors, using image array based sensors, such as CCD or CMOS wavefront sensors, which sample at a significantly lower rate than the actuator bandwidth. The integrative nature of the sensor produces a blurred image when the image moves much faster than the exposure period. The key concept of this paper is to extract system dynamics from the image blur. We consider the image blur as a nonlinear temporal-to-spatial transformation under a known input excitation, such as a sinusoid. The output signal parameters, such as amplitude and phase, characterize the frequency response of the system at the specific excitation frequency. This problem may be posed as a nonlinear minimization: finding output signal parameters to match the predicted spatial distribution with the measurement. However, the nonlinear mapping is not one-to-one, or, equivalently, the solution of the nonlinear minimization is non-unique. We propose two methods for avoiding this aliasing problem: by imposing a continuity constraint or by solving the minimization over two different exposure periods. The efficacy of the proposed identification approach for a single-input/single-output system is experimentally demonstrated by accurately obtaining the frequency response of a fast steering mirror up to 500Hz using a 30 Hz CCD camera."
1535432,21246,9475,Abstraction based solution of complex attainability problems for decomposable continuous plants,2010,"The focus of the present paper is systems of nonlinear continuous sub-plants that share a common input but are otherwise coupled only through the specification of a control problem, possibly including state constraints. Examples include cart-pole systems and collision avoidance problems involving multiple vehicles. We propose a method that uses finite state models for solving highly complex continuous attainability problems. We first prove that finite state models, also called discrete abstractions, of the overall plant may be obtained as products of abstractions of sub-plants. The latter, which we call factors, may be determined quickly and concurrently. We also modify a state-of-the-art algorithm for the discrete, auxiliary attainability problems that arise, to work directly with the set of factors and prove that the asymptotic computational complexity of the modified algorithm matches that of the original one. In practice, the latter will often be much slower since the representation of the abstraction of the overall plant on a computer is likely to require an excessive amount of memory. Practicability of our method is demonstrated by successfully designing discrete controllers that globally stabilize decomposable nonlinear continuous plants whose overall finite state models would include millions of states and billions of transitions. Working with the factors instead, problem data fit into main memory of a customary personal computer, and computations take only minutes."
1112774,21246,9475,How can macroscopic models reveal self-organization in traffic flow?,2012,"In this paper we propose a new modeling technique for vehicular traffic flow, designed for capturing at a macroscopic level some effects, due to the microscopic granularity of the flow of cars, which would be lost with a purely continuous approach. The starting point is a multiscale method for pedestrian modeling, recently introduced in [1], in which measure-theoretic tools are used to manage the microscopic and the macroscopic scales under a unique framework. In the resulting coupled model the two scales coexist and share information, in the sense that the same system is simultaneously described from both a discrete (microscopic) and a continuous (macroscopic) perspective. This way it is possible to perform numerical simulations in which the single trajectories and the average density of the moving agents affect each other. Such a method is here revisited in order to deal with multi-population traffic flow on networks. For illustrative purposes, we focus on the simple case of the intersection of two roads. By exploiting one of the main features of the multiscale method, namely its dimension-independence, we treat one-dimensional roads and two-dimensional junctions in a natural way, without referring to classical network theory. Furthermore, thanks to the coupling between the microscopic and the macroscopic scales, we model the continuous flow of cars without losing the right amount of granularity, which characterizes the real physical system and triggers self-organization effects, such as, for example, the oscillatory patterns visible at jammed uncontrolled crossroads."
2229131,21246,9475,MPC for tracking target sets,2009,"This paper deals with the problem of tracking target sets using a model predictive control (MPC) law. Some MPC applications require a control strategy in which some system outputs are controlled within specified ranges or zones (zone control), while some others variables - possibly including input variables - are steered to fixed target or set-point. In real applications, this problem is often overcome by including and excluding an appropriate penalization for the output errors in the control cost function. In this way, throughout the continuous operation of the process, the control system keeps switching from one controller to another, and even if a stabilizing control law is developed for each of the control configurations, switching among stable controllers not necessarily produces a stable closed loop system. From a theoretical point of view, the control objective of this kind of problem can be seen as a target set (in the output space) instead of a target point, since inside the zones there are no preferences between one point and another. In this work, a stable MPC formulation with several practical properties is developed for this scenario. The concept of distance from a point to a set is exploited to propose an additional cost term, which ensures both, recursive feasibility and local optimality. The performance of the proposed strategy is illustrated by simulation of a subsystem of an industrial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) system and a quadruple tank process."
2094052,21246,9475,Robust MIMO control of a parallel kinematics nano-positioner for high resolution high bandwidth tracking and repetitive tasks,2007,"This paper presents the design and implementation of robust control schemes for two applications of a nanopositioning stage (1) reference trajectory tracking with high resolution over a given bandwidth (2) control design for repetitive motions. The stage has a low degree of freedom monolithic parallel kinematic mechanism using flexure hinges. It is driven by piezoelectric actuators and its displacement is detected by capacitance gauges. The design has strongly coupled dynamics with each actuator input producing in multi- axis motions. The nano-positioner is modeled as a multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) system, and the MIMO plant model is identified by time-domain identification methods. The design of the nano-positioner relies heavily on the control design to account for the high coupling in the system. The proposed H infin  MIMO controller achieves a good performance in terms of resolution, bandwidth and robustness to the modeling uncertainty. In the second part of the paper, we present control design for tasks that require repetitive motion of nano positioning system. These tasks are quite common in micro/nano manipulation and manufacturing. This paper presents a robust control design that gives a significant (over thirty fold) improvement in tracking of repetitive motions on a prespecified frequency band. This design, unlike other schemes, is robust to modeling uncertainties that arise in flexure based mechanisms, and does not require any learning steps during its real time implementation. This design scheme is implemented on a parallel-kinematics XYZ nano positioning stage for repetitive nano-manipulation and nano-manufacturing applications."

In particular, focusing on a 2018 Mars rover concept, which was considered as part of a potential Mars Sample Return campaign, we model the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase and the rover traverse phase as four sequential decision-making stages. The problem is to find a sequence of divert and driving maneuvers so that the rover drive is minimized and the probability of a mission failure (e.g., due to a failed landing) is below a user-specified bound. By solving this problem for several different values of the model parameters (e.g., divert authority), this approach enables rigorous, accurate and systematic trade-offs for the EDL system vs. the mobility system, and, more in general, cross-domain trade-offs for the different phases of a space mission. The overall optimization problem can be seen as a chance-constrained dynamic programming problem, with the additional complexity that 1) in some stages the disturbances do not have any probabilistic characterization, and 2) the state space is extremely large (i.e, hundreds of millions of states for trade-offs with high-resolution Martian maps). To this purpose, we solve the problem by performing an unconventional combination of average and minimax cost analysis and by leveraging high efficient computation tools from the image processing community. Preliminary trade-off results are presented."
1954567,21246,9475,"A continuous-state version of discrete randomized shortest-paths, with application to path planning",2011,"This work investigates the continuous-state counterpart of the discrete randomized shortest-path framework (RSP, [23]) on a graph. Given a weighted directed graph G, the RSP considers the policy that minimizes the expected cost (exploitation) to reach a destination node from a source node, while maintaining a constant relative entropy spread in the graph (exploration). This results in a Boltzmann probability distribution on the (usually infinite) set of paths connecting the source node and the destination node, depending on an inverse temperature parameter θ. This framework defines a biased random walk on the graph that gradually favors low-cost paths as θ increases. It is shown that the continuous-state counterpart requires the solution of two partial differential equations - providing forward and backward variables - from which all the quantities of interest can be computed. For instance, the best local move is obtained by taking the gradient of the logarithm of one of these solutions, namely the backward variable. These partial differential equations are the socalled steady-state Bloch equations to which the Feynman-Kac formula provides a path integral solution. The RSP framework is therefore a discrete-state equivalent of the continuous Feynman-Kac diffusion process involving the Wiener measure. Finally, it is shown that the continuous-time continuous-state optimal randomized policy is obtained by solving a diffusion equation with an external drift provided by the gradient of the logarithm of the backward variable, playing the role of a potential."
702400,21246,9475,An improved Predictive Optimal Controller with elastic search space for steam temperature control of large-scale supercritical power unit,2012,"Predictive optimal control (POC) combined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) modeling and advanced heuristic optimization is a powerful technique for intelligent control. But actual implementation of the POC in complex industrial processes is limited by its known drawbacks, including the oscillation resulting from random search direction, difficulty in meeting the real-time requirement, and unresolved adaptability and generalization ability of the ANN predictive model. In resolving these problems, an improved Intelligent Predictive Optimal Controller (IPOC) with elastic search space is proposed in this paper. A new simpler and high-efficiency Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to find the optimal solution in fewer epochs to meet the real-time control requirements. The system output error in each control step is fed back to adjust the search space dynamically to prevent control oscillation and also make it easier to find the optimal solution. An improved recurrent neural network with external delayed inputs and outputs is constructed to model the dynamic response of the highly nonlinear system. The proposed IPOC is used to superheater steam temperature control of a 600MW supercritical power unit. Extensive control simulation tests are made to verify the validity of the new control scheme in a full-scope simulator."
2184656,21246,9475,Robust synthesis in mechanism design,2010,"This paper considers two topics in mechanism design: fragility of optimal auctions and computationally constructive procedures for dynamic mechanisms. The first part of the paper considers the well studied topic in mechanism design of optimal auctions, i.e., auctions that produce maximal revenue. The design of an optimal auction in a general setting requires the principal to have complete knowledge of the probabilistic beliefs of the agents (bidders). This work shows that such an assumption leads to fragile designs in which a slight perturbation to these beliefs can alter the outcome of the auction significantly. We propose an alternative approach where the designer takes into account a nominal environment and provides incentives that are robust to perturbations on the beliefs of the agents. Using the theory of robust optimization, we find relevant uncertainty classes for which the proposed robust mechanisms have the same computational complexity as the nominal designs. The second part of the paper discusses dynamic mechanism design. Whereas standard mechanism design presumes a one shot scenario, dynamic mechanism design considers perpetual phenomena, e.g., the allocation of a limited resource to transient users. The dynamic mechanism problem has received considerable attention given the wealth of applications. Most work has concentrated on finding appropriate conditions according to which static designs have natural extensions to the dynamic setting. This paper considers optimal dynamic mechanisms using tools from robust control theory. In this framework the design of incentives for a desired social planner's policy reduces to the search of a storage function, analogous to synthesis problems involving dissipation inequalities. For specific structures, optimizing the incentives reduces to solving a linear program."
2083432,21246,9475,On the transfer function of the zero dynamics for a boundary controlled heat problem in two dimensions,2009,"We recently introduced a new approach, zero dynamics inverse (ZDI) design, for designing a feedback compensation scheme achieving asymptotic regulation, i.e., asymptotic tracking and/or disturbance rejection, for a linear or nonlinear distributed parameter system (DPS) in the case when only the value of the signal w(t) to be tracked or rejected are known are known at any instant of time. In analogy with the non-equilibrium formulation of output regulation the control objective is to achieve zero steady-state error together with ultimate boundedness of the state of the system and the controller(s), with a bound determined by bounds on the norms of the initial data and w. In particular, a controller solving this problem depends only on a bound on the norm of w not on the particular choice of w, which is used only as an input to the controller. ZDI design consists of the interconnection of a stabilizing feedback compensator and a cascade controller, designed in a universal way from the zero dynamics of the closed-loop feedback system. This methodology has evolved over a series of papers for asymptotic regulation for specific linear boundary control systems and for set-point control of linear and nonlinear boundary control systems in one spatial dimension, in which case the input and output spaces for the transfer functions were finite dimensional. In this paper, we formulate the main ingredients of the zero dynamics inverse design methodology for a class of abstract linear boundary control systems for problems with infinite dimensional input and output space. We conclude by illustrating the design for a boundary controlled heat equation on a two dimensional rectangle."
848646,21246,9475,Tracking of the UAV trajectory on the basis of bearing-only observations,2014,"This work considers the tracking of the UAV (unmanned aviation vehicle) path on the basis of bearingonly observations including azimuth and elevation angles. The significance of this research becomes clear in the case when GPS either does not work at all or produce the high level of the measurement errors. It is assumed that either UAV's opto-electronic cameras or radar systems are able to capture the angular position of objects with known coordinates and to measure the azimuth and elevation angles of the sight line. Such measurements involve the real position of UAV in implicit form, and therefore some of nonlinear filters such as Extended Kalman filter (EKF) or others may be used in order to implement these measurements for UAV control. However, all such approximate nonlinear filters produce the estimations with unknown bias and quadratic errors. This peculiarity prevents the data fusion in more or less regular way. Meanwhile, there is well-known method of pseudomeasurements which reduces the estimation problem to the linear settings. In this article we develop the modified pseudomeasurement method without bias and with the possibility to evaluate the second moments of the UAV position errors which helps to realize the data fusion. On the basis of this filtering algorithm we develop the control algorithm for tracking of given reference path under external perturbation and noised angular measurements. Modelling examples show the nice performance of the control algorithm."
793012,21246,9475,Robust fault detection and reconfiguration in sampled-data uncertain distributed processes,2011,"This paper focuses on robust model-based fault detection and fault-tolerant control of spatially distributed processes described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) subject to time-varying external disturbances, control actuator faults and measurement sampling rate constraints. Using an approximate finite-dimensional system that captures the dominant dynamics of the PDE, an observer-based output feedback controller is initially designed to enforce robust stability with an arbitrarily small ultimate bound on the closed-loop state in the absence of faults. A finite-dimensional inter-sample model predictor is then embedded within the controller to provide the observer with estimates of the measured output between the sampling times, and the state of the model is updated using the measured output at each sampling time. By formulating the sampled-data finite-dimensional closed-loop system as a combined discrete-continuous system, a necessary and sufficient condition for robust closed-loop stability is obtained and used to explicitly characterize the tradeoffs between the sampling rate, the degree of model uncertainty, the disturbance size, the size of the achievable ultimate bound on the closed-loop state, and the choice of actuator/sensor locations. Based on this analysis, a time-varying alarm threshold on the fault detection residual is obtained, together with an actuator reconfiguration law that determines the set of feasible fall-back actuators that preserve robust closed-loop stability. Finally, the result is illustrated through an application to a representative diffusion-reaction process."
1944625,21246,9475,Output feedback Robust tube based MPC for tracking of piece-wise constant references,2007,"This paper presents a novel formulation of a robust output feedback model predictive controller to track piecewise constant references (output feedback RMPCT). The real plant is assumed to be modelled as a linear system with additive bounded uncertainties on the states. Under mild assumptions, the proposed MPC can steer the uncertain system in an admissible evolution to any admissible steady state, that is, under any change of the set point. The proposed output feedback controller consists of a stable state estimator and a recently developed robustly stabilizing, tube based, model predictive control for tracking. Feasibility of the proposed controller for any admissible setpoint is achieved by adding an artificial steady state as decision variable. Robust constraint satisfaction is guaranteed by tube-based approach and considering nominal predictions. Robust stability and convergence to (a neighborhood of) the desired steady state is ensured by considering a modified cost function and an extended terminal constraint. The cost function penalizes the tracking error with the artificial reference and the deviation between the artificial and desired steady state; the terminal constraint restricts the terminal state and the artificial steady state. The optimization problem to be solved is a quadratic programming problem, which allows explicit implementations. Robust stability is guaranteed under mild conditions which allows one to consider tracking specifications and disturbance rejection conditions. Moreover, a simple method to achieve offset-free control, compensating the steady tracking error of the outputs, is presented."

The real plant is assumed to be modelled as a linear system with additive bounded uncertainties on the states. Under mild assumptions, the proposed MPC can steer the uncertain system in an admissible evolution to any admissible steady state, that is, under any change of the set point. This allows us to reject constant disturbances compensating the effect of then, changing the setpoint.

The optimization problem to be solved is a quadratic programming problem, which allows explicit implementations. In order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed controller, this has been tested on a real positioning plant consisting in a linear motor driving a cart. The fast dynamics of the systems requires an explicit calculation of the controller, which has been implemented by means of a search tree strategy. The experimental results show the robust tracking and the admissible evolution of the closed loop system."
1922659,21246,9475,A dynamic programming approach to two-stage mean-variance portfolio selection in cointegrated vector autoregressive systems,2008,"In this paper we study the problem of optimal portfolio construction when the trading horizon consists of two consecutive decision intervals and rebalancing is permitted. It is assumed that the log-prices of the underlying assets are non-stationary, and specifically follow a discrete-time cointegrated vector autoregressive model. We extend the classical Markowitz mean-variance optimization approach to a multi-period setting, in which the new objective is to maximize the total expected return, subject to a constraint on the total allowable risk. In contrast to traditional approaches, we adopt a definition for risk which takes into account the non-zero correlations between the inter-stage returns. This portfolio optimization problem amounts to not only determining the relative proportions of the assets to hold during each stage, but also requires one to determine the degree of portfolio leverage to assume. Due to a fixed constraint on the standard deviation of the total return, the leverage decision is equivalent to deciding how to optimally partition the allowed variance, and thus variance can be viewed as a shared resource between the stages. We derive the optimal portfolio weights and variance scheduling scheme for a trading strategy based on a dynamic programming approach, which is utilized in order to make the problem computationally tractable. The performance of this method is compared to other trading strategies using both Monte Carlo simulations and real data, and promising results are obtained."
886057,21246,9475,Resource-aware model predictive control of spatially distributed processes using event-triggered communication,2013,"This work focuses on the design of a resource-aware model predictive control (MPC) system for spatially distributed processes with low-order dynamics and a limited number of output measurements. A reduced-order model that captures the dominant process dynamics is initially obtained and used to design a Lyapunov-based output feedback MPC. A finite-dimensional state observer is included in the sensors to generate estimates of the slow states of the infinite-dimensional systems which are broadcast over the network to update the states of the reduced-order model used in the MPC controller at each sampling time. Precise conditions that guarantee closed-loop stability under plant-model mismatch are derived and used to devise an event-triggered sensor-controller communication strategy that minimizes network utilization without jeopardizing closed-loop stability. The key idea is to monitor the model estimation error at each sampling time and suspend communication when the prescribed stability bounds obtained based on a forecast of the future evolution of the Lyapunov function are satisfied. At times when the model estimation error fails to satisfy the projected bound on the evolution of the Lyapunov function, the sensors are prompted to proactively transmit the observer-generated state estimates to update the model states and avert instability. Finally, the design and implementation of the proposed event-triggered MPC are illustrated using a diffusion-reaction process example."
2541811,21246,9475,An ensemble Kalman filtering approach to highway traffic estimation using GPS enabled mobile devices,2008,"Traffic state estimation is a challenging problem for the transportation community due to the limited deployment of sensing infrastructure. However, recent trends in the mobile phone industry suggest that GPS equipped devices will become standard in the next few years. Leveraging these GPS equipped devices as traffic sensors will fundamentally change the type and the quality of traffic data collected on large scales in the near future. New traffic models and data assimilation algorithms must be developed to efficiently transform this data into usable traffic information. In this work, we introduce a new partial differential equation (PDE) based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards PDE, which serves as a flow model for velocity. We formulate a Godunov discretization scheme to cast the PDE into a Velocity Cell Transmission Model (CTM-v), which is a nonlinear dynamical system with a time varying observation matrix. The Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) technique is applied to the CTM- v to estimate the velocity field on the highway using data obtained from GPS devices, and the method is illustrated in microsimulation on a fully calibrated model of I880 in California. Experimental validation is performed through the unprecedented 100-vehicle Mobile Century experiment, which used a novel privacy-preserving traffic monitoring system to collect GPS cell phone data specifically for this research."
1624450,21246,9475,On the basics for simulation of feedback-based stock trading strategies: An invited tutorial session,2013,"This paper provides an overview of our CDC tutorial session covering the basics of simulation and performance evaluation associated with stock trading via feedback control methods. The specific trading algorithms which we describe fall under the umbrella of “pure technical analysis” in that they are model-free with no parametrization of the stock-price process assumed. True to technical analysis, we adopt the point of view that the stock price p(t) is an external input with no predictive model for its evolution. The feedback controller adapts the investment level I(t) based on the evolution of the trading gains or losses over time. In the introductory talk, it is explained how this point of view “opens doors” for new research contributions from the control community. The simulations which we consider are of two types: In some cases, the controller's performance is studied using synthetic classes of stock prices such as Geometric Brownian Motion. In other cases, real historical prices are brought into play. We refer to such a real-price simulation as a “backtest.” Once we cover the trading mechanics, the notion of “benchmark price classes,” data acquisition and coding of algorithms, the focal point becomes performance evaluation. That is, with g(t) denoting cumulative gains or losses, we describe a number of metrics which are used to evaluate the performance associated with the trajectory pair (I(·), g(·)). Whereas the first half of the tutorial concentrates on trading a single stock, the last half addresses multi-asset portfolios, educational aspects and the notion of trading competitions."
2968638,21246,9475,D-optimal spatio-temporal sampling design for identification of distributed parameter systems,2016,"The aim of this paper is to develop a method for optimal node activation in large-scale sensor networks whose measurements are to be used to estimate unknown parameters of a distributed parameter system. Given a partition of the observation horizon into a finite number of intervals, the problem consists in selecting gaged sites on each interval so that the determinant of the Fisher information matrix associated with the estimated parameters be maximal. A major novelty here is that the numbers of active sensors may differ from interval to interval in accordance with the amount of information about the parameters expected in these intervals. An additional requirement is that, given a spatially-varying cost of taking measurements, the resulting total cost of the experiment must not exceed a fixed budget. The combinatorial nature of the sensor selection problem is circumvented by operating on the spatial density of sensors, rather than on the sensor locations. The original problem then reduces to maximizing the determinant of the sum of finite convex combinations of some nonnegative definite matrices subject to a linear inequality constraint reflecting the limited experimental budget and additional box constraints on the weights of this combination. Optimality conditions are indicated and simplicial decomposition is applied to obtain numerical solutions. As a result, a simple computational scheme is obtained which can be implemented without resorting to sophisticated numerical software."
2632207,21246,9475,A distributed strategy for electricity distribution network control in the face of DER compromises,2015,"We focus on the question of distributed control of electricity distribution networks in the face of security attacks to Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Our attack model includes strategic manipulation of DER set-points by an external hacker to induce a sudden compromise of a subset of DERs connected to the network. We approach the distributed control design problem in two stages. In the first stage, we model the attacker-defender interaction as a Stackelberg game. The attacker (leader) disconnects a subset of DERs by sending them wrong set-point signals. The distribution utility (follower) response includes Volt-VAR control of non-compromised DERs and load control. The objective of the attacker (resp. defender) is to maximize (resp. minimize) the weighted sum of the total cost due to loss of frequency regulation and the cost due to loss of voltage regulation. In the second stage, we propose a distributed control (defender response) strategy for each local controller such that, if sudden supply-demand mismatch is detected (for example, due to DER compromises), the local controllers automatically respond based on their respective observations of local fluctuations in voltage and frequency. This strategy aims to achieve diversification of DER functions in the sense that each uncompromised DER node either contributes to voltage regulation (by contributing reactive power) or to frequency regulation (by contributing active power). We illustrate the effectiveness of this control strategy on a benchmark network."
627803,21246,9475,Optimal control of transient flow in natural gas networks,2015,"We outline a new control system model for the distributed dynamics of compressible gas flow through large-scale pipeline networks with time-varying injections, withdrawals, and control actions of compressors and regulators. The gas dynamics PDE equations over the pipelines, together with boundary conditions at junctions, are reduced using lumped elements to a sparse nonlinear ODE system expressed in vector-matrix form using graph theoretic notation. This system, which we call the reduced network flow (RNF) model, is a consistent discretization of the PDE equations for gas flow. The RNF forms the dynamic constraints for optimal control problems for pipeline systems with known time-varying withdrawals and injections and gas pressure limits throughout the network. The objectives include economic transient compression (ETC) and minimum load shedding (MLS), which involve minimizing compression costs or, if that is infeasible, minimizing the unfulfilled deliveries, respectively. These continuous functional optimization problems are approximated using the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) pseudospectral collocation scheme to yield a family of nonlinear programs, whose solutions approach the optima with finer discretization. Simulation and optimization of time-varying scenarios on an example natural gas transmission network demonstrate the gains in security and efficiency over methods that assume steady-state behavior."
1599346,21246,9475,Inference of temporally evolving network dynamics with applications in biological systems,2011,"Modeling of biological signal pathways forms the basis of systems biology. Also, the problem of identifying dynamics of biological networks is of critical importance in order to understand biological systems. In this paper, we propose a data-driven inference scheme to identify dynamics with a local point of view, the Jacobian matrix. A graph model is a natural way to represent a biological signal pathway and doesn't require any constraints on dynamics such as mass action kinetics or Hill function representations, used in Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models. A graph is a set of vertices which represents state, and a set of edges which depicts the relationship or connection between two or more states. Once a system is abstracted by a graph, in order to identify the activity level of the corresponding interactions based on a given data set, we reformulate the problem as a Linear Quadratic (LQ) Optimal Control problem by transforming the unknown entries of the activity of edges into the control inputs of the LQ setting. In the formulation of the LQ problem, we use an adjacency map as a priori information and define a performance index which both drives the connectivity of the graph to match the biological data as well as generates a sparse network. Through simulation studies on simple examples, it is shown that this scheme can help to capture the topological change of a biological signal pathway and show the influence or activity of each edge over time. Also, we sketch briefly the potential application of this approach to correcting the graph model."
1774593,21246,9475,Feedback control of a wheeled snake mechanism with the Transverse Function approach,2010,"The Transverse Function (TF) approach is applied to the tracking control problem for a nonholonomic three-segments/snake-like wheeled mechanism similar to a planar low-dimensional version of Hirose's Active Cord Mechanism (ACM). Unlike earlier studies devoted to this type of serpentine mechanism and based on the computation and sequential application of a discrete number of open-loop control primitives, the proposed control design yields smooth (nonlinear) feedbacks in the spirit, and prolongation, of Linear Control Theory. It is also supported by a rigorous stability analysis, and it further includes a solution to the delicate -often overlooked-problem of mechanical singularities avoidance. Another asset of the approach is that the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors, with arbitrary tracking precision obtained via the tuning of the considered transverse function parameters, is achieved for any motion of the reference frame used to specify the desired gross motion of the mechanism. These properties are illustrated by simulation results. The fact that the TF approach involves periodic functions with time-derivatives depending on frequencies used as extra control variables points out connections between this approach and biologically inspired Central Pattern Generators (CPG) often evoked in the literature on systems exhibiting internal oscillatory behavior."
2947920,21246,9475,From ideal to packet-based communication for spatially invariant systems with various interconnection structures,2016,"In this paper we consider systems consisting of a number of spatially invariant, i.e., identical, subsystems that use packet-based communication networks for the exchange of information. Recent literature has shown that for an infinite number of such interconnected networked subsystems, the overall system can be modeled as an infinite interconnection of identical hybrid (sub)systems. Based on this hybrid modeling perspective, conditions were derived guaranteeing uniform global exponentially stability (UGES) or ℒ p -gain performance. These conditions were formulated locally in the sense that only the local dynamics of a single hybrid subsystem in the interconnection is needed in order to obtain a maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) for all of the individual communication networks such that these global stability properties are guaranteed for the complete infinite-dimensional system. In this work we will connect these results to other known results in the literature concerning infinite-dimensional spatially invariant systems and extend them in various directions, thereby showing the generic nature of the obtained hybrid modeling framework. In particular, it is shown that the stability and performance conditions as derived for the perfect communication case of the infinite spatially invariant interconnection guarantee robustness of the stability/performance property in the packet-based communication case. In addition, extensions to periodic interconnections and finite interconnections with boundary conditions will be discussed explicitly, bringing the theory closer to practical applications, which will be epitomized in a two-sided vehicular platooning example concerning ℒ 2 -stability."
2683050,21246,9475,Entrainment of Goodwin's oscillators by periodic exogenous signals,2015,"The circadian pacemakers, which have been discovered in most of living organisms, are known to be entrainable by the environmental exogenuous cues, or zeitgebers (“time givers”). If the influence of an exogenous periodic excitation is sufficiently long, the internal circadian “clock” adjusts the phase and period to the external signal. The pattern of zeitgeber's oscillations is then reproduced for a long duration by the pacemaker, even when isolated from the environment. In recent years, the phenomenon of entrainment of biological clocks has been the subject of extensive experimental research, mainly focusing on revelation of dependencies between the “free-run” and disturbed circadian cycles. Meanwhile, the mathematical model of entrainment is still far from being well understood; to the best of the authors' knowledge, neither conventional mathematical definitions of entrainment nor mathematical proofs of this property for realistic models of circadian oscillators have been elaborated. In this paper, we make a substantial effort towards filling this gap, by considering dynamics of Goodwin-type oscillators under periodic excitations. We show that any periodic external signal gives birth to a periodic solution of the same period, which is in general non-unique. Along with increasing signal amplitude, the forced solution becomes not only unique but also asymptotically stable. This sheds light on the mathematical meaning of the entrainment phenomena and confirms the entrainability of circadian rhythms by sufficiently strong periodic signals, reported in the biological literature."
1400314,21246,9475,Dynamic mechanism design in correlated environments,2013,"We consider the problem of implementing a principal's decision truthfully in a private-value, correlated environment in which agents receive information over time. This setting comprises a deviation from the literature of dynamic mechanism design that typically employs the assumption that the distribution of an agent's private signal is independent of other agents' private information history conditional on past public decisions. We derive sufficient conditions for designing monetary transfers that guarantee implementation of the desired policy in a periodic expost incentive compatible equilibrium. For risk neutral agents in a finite state, finite action Markovian environment this set of sufficient conditions reduces to a finite set of linear inequalities. This is an appealing feature given that the agent is faced with a partial observation stochastic optimization problem with progressively increasing information state. The class of mechanisms considered in our methodology include the dynamic VCG algorithm that has been developed for the case where agents' dynamics are coupled only through the principal's decision. Besides implementing the desired policy, the principal may want to impose specifications on the expected revenue or model her uncertainty regarding her knowledge of agents' perceived environment. We show how our conditions for periodic ex post incentive compatibility can be incorporated as part of a robust optimization approach to policy implementation that takes these additional requirements into account."
1741556,21246,9475,Flexible and cost efficient power consumption using economic MPC a supermarket refrigeration benchmark,2011,"Supermarket refrigeration consumes substantial amounts of energy. However due to the thermal capacity of the refrigerated goods, parts of the cooling capacity delivered can be shifted in time without deteriorating the food quality. In this paper we introduce a novel economic-optimizing MPC scheme that reduces operating costs by utilizing the thermal storage capabilities. In the study we specifically address advantages coming from daily variations in outdoor temperature and electricity prices but other aspects such as peak load reduction are also considered. An important contribution of this paper is also the formulation of a new cost function for our proposed power management system. This means the refrigeration system is enabled to contribute with ancillary services to the balancing power market. Since significant amounts of regulating power are needed for a higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, this feature will be in high demand in a future intelligent power grid (Smart Grid). Our perspective is seen from the refrigeration system but, as we demonstrate, the involvement in the balancing market can be economically beneficial for the system itself, while delivering crucial services to the Smart Grid. We simulate the system using models validated against data from real supermarkets as well as weather data and spot and regulating power prices from the Nordic power market."
1602567,21246,9475,Near-optimal execution policies for demand-response contracts in electricity markets,2013,"Demand side participation is essential for achieving real-time energy balance in today's electricity grid. Demand-response contracts, where an electric utility company buys options from consumers to reduce their load in future, are one of the important tools to increase the demand-side participation. In this paper, we consider the operational problem of optimally exercising the available contracts over the planning horizon such that the total cost to satisfy the demand is minimized. In particular, we consider the objective of minimizing the sum of the expected l β -norm of the load deviations from given thresholds and the contract execution costs over the planning horizon. We present a data driven near-optimal algorithm for the contract execution problem. Our algorithm is a sample average approximation (SAA) based and we provide a sample complexity bound on the number of demand samples required to compute a (1 + e)-approximate policy for any e > 0. Our SAA algorithm is quite general and can be adapted to quite general demand models and objective function. For the special case where the demand in each period is i.i.d., we show that a static solution is optimal for the dynamic problem. We also conduct a numerical study to compare the performance of our SAA based DP algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that we can achieve a (1+e)-approximation in significantly smaller number of samples than what is implied by the theoretical bounds. Moreover, the structure of the approximate policy also shows that it can be well approximated by a simple piecewise linear function of the state."
2492016,21246,9475,A novel differential evolution algorithm for global search and sensor selection,2010,"Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is a simple yet powerful population-based stochastic search technique for solving optimization problems in the continuous search domain. However, the performance of the canonical DE algorithm crucially depends on appropriately choosing mutation strategies and their associated parameter settings. Unsuitable choice of trial vector generation manners and control parameter values may deteriorate the search process. In this paper, a new version of the differential evolution algorithm is reported, in which both diverse mutation operators and mutation rates are heuristically assigned to various individuals. During the iteration process, the whole populations are classified into subgroups by sufficiently analyzed the individuals' state. Multiple population parallel search policy can effectively expedite the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Diverse mutation operators with distinct characters are assigned to relative subgroups, which are considered to be a better balance between exploration and exploitation. The empirical values and negative feedback technique are used in parameters selection, which relieve the burden of specifying the parameters values. The experimental study of the new approach is test on a set of standard benchmark functions and a practical sensor selection problem for turbofan engine health estimation. The simulation results suggest that it outperforms to other state-of-the-art techniques referred to in this paper in terms of the quality of the final solutions."
1122259,21246,9475,Reducing packet loss bursts in a wireless mesh network for stochastic bounds on estimation error,2011,"A big challenge for wireless networked control systems is how to design the underlying networking algorithms and protocols to provide high reliability, defined as the end-to-end probability of packet delivery, despite the high packet loss rates of individual wireless links. This paper formulates the problem of jointly designing a set of packet forwarding policies on a multipath mesh network to meet control application requirements. We derive several results to help understand the problem space. First, we demonstrate that some common approaches, like applying a single forwarding policy to all packets or always routing packets on disjoint paths, are not optimal for the application when the links are bursty. Second, we introduce the notion of dominance to give a partial ordering to sets of forwarding policies, used to prove that an optimal policy schedules all outgoing links at each node and that an upper bound on the performance attained by unicast forwarding policies on the network graph can be computed assuming a flooding policy. Third, we demonstrate how to convert application performance metrics to packet forwarding policy objectives, using the probability that the error covariance of a Kalman filter stays within a bound as our application metric. Fourth, we provide an algorithm to compute the joint probability mass function that a sequence of packets are delivered, given a set of policies and a network graph. Finally, we describe how to obtain optimal policies via an exhaustive search, motivating future research for more computationally efficient solutions."
1224808,21246,23735,Outdoor flocking and formation flight with autonomous aerial robots,2014,"We present the first decentralized multi-copter flock that performs stable autonomous outdoor flight with up to 10 flying agents. By decentralized and autonomous we mean that all members navigate themselves based on the dynamic information received from other robots in the vicinity. We do not use central data processing or control; instead, all the necessary computations are carried out by miniature on-board computers. The only global information the system exploits is from GPS receivers, while the units use wireless modules to share this positional information with other flock members locally. Collective behavior is based on a decentralized control framework with bio-inspiration from statistical physical modelling of animal swarms. In addition, the model is optimized for stable group flight even in a noisy, windy, delayed and error-prone environment. Using this framework we successfully implemented several fundamental collective flight tasks with up to 10 units: i) we achieved self-propelled flocking in a bounded area with self-organized object avoidance capabilities and ii) performed collective target tracking with stable formation flights (grid, rotating ring, straight line). With realistic numerical simulations we demonstrated that the local broadcast-type communication and the decentralized autonomous control method allows for the scalability of the model for much larger flocks."
2119292,21246,9475,"Exact unknown-state, unknown-input reconstruction: A geometric framework for discrete-time systems",2009,"The complete solution of the unknown-state, unknown-input reconstruction problem in systems with invariant zeros is intrinsically limited by the fact that for any invariant zero, at least one initial state exists, such that, when the mode associated to the invariant zero is suitably injected into the system, the corresponding output is zero. Although in the awareness of this restriction, the problem of reconstructing the initial state and the inaccessible inputs from the available measurements is the object of a fair amount of research activities because of its impact on a wide range of applications, specifically those dealing with the synthesis of enhanced-reliability control systems. In this context, the present paper contributes a geometric method aimed at solving the exact unknown-state, unknown-input reconstruction problem in discrete-time linear time-invariant multivariable systems with nonminimum-phase zeros. The case where all the system invariant zeros lie in the open set outside the unit disc of the complex plane is regarded as the basic one. The difficulties related to the presence of those invariant zeros are overcome by allowing a reconstruction delay commensurate to the invariant zero time constants. The same technique also applies to the case of systems without invariant zeros. In the latter circumstance, however, the reconstruction delay is related to the number of iteration required by the algorithm for the computation of a specific subspace to converge. Finally, the more general case where the problem is stated for a system whose invariant zeros lie both inside and outside the unit disc of the complex plane is reduced to the basic problem referred to a new system, derived from the original one through a procedure aimed at replacing the minimum-phase zeros with their mirror images with respect to the unit circle."
2183091,21246,9475,A hybrid systems model for supervisory cognitive state identification and estimation in neural prosthetics,2008,"This paper presents a method to identify a class of hybrid system models that arise in cognitive neural prosthetic medical devices that aim to help the severely handicapped. In such systems a ?supervisory decoder? is required to classify the activity of multi-unit extracellular neural recordings into a discrete set of modes that model the evolution of the brain?s planning process. We introduce a Gibbs sampling method to identify the key parameters of a GLHMM, a hybrid dynamical system that combines a set of generalized linear models (GLM) for dynamics of neuronal signals with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that describes the discrete transitions between the brain?s cognitive or planning states. Multiple neural signals of mixed type, including local field potentials and spike arrival times, are integrated into the model using the GLM framework. The identified model can then be used as the basis for the supervisory decoding (or estimation) of the current cognitive or planning state. The identification algorithm is applied to extracellular neural recordings obtained from set of electrodes acutely implanted in the posterior parietal cortex of a rhesus monkey. The results demonstrate the ability to accurately decode changes in behavioral or cognitive state during reaching tasks, even when the model parameters are identified from small data sets. The GLHMM models and the associated identification methods are generally applicable beyond the neural application domain."
1118548,21246,9475,Learning from time series: Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction,2012,"Many modeling problems require to estimate a scalar output from one or more time series. Such problems are usually tackled by extracting a fixed number of features from the time series (like their statistical moments), with a consequent loss in information that leads to suboptimal predictive models. Moreover, feature extraction techniques usually make assumptions that are not met by real world settings (e.g. uniformly sampled time series of constant length), and fail to deliver a thorough methodology to deal with noisy data. In this paper a methodology based on functional learning is proposed to overcome the aforementioned problems; the proposed Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction (SAFE) approach allows to derive continuous, smooth estimates of time series data (yielding aggregate local information), while simultaneously estimating a continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions. The SAFE paradigm enjoys several properties like closed form solution, incorporation of first and second order derivative information into the regressor matrix, interpretability of the generated functional predictor and the possibility to exploit Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces setting to yield nonlinear predictive models. Simulation studies are provided to highlight the strengths of the new methodology w.r.t. standard unsupervised feature selection approaches."
2852805,21246,9475,Tractable structure learning in radial physical flow networks,2016,"Physical Flow Networks are different infrastructure networks that allow the flow of physical commodities through edges between its constituent nodes. These include power grid, natural gas transmission network, water pipelines etc. In such networks, the flow on each edge is characterized by a function of the nodal potentials on either side of the edge. Further the net flow in and out of each node is conserved. Learning the structure and state of physical networks is necessary for optimal control as well as to quantify its privacy needs. We consider radial flow networks and study the problem of learning the operational network from a loopy graph of candidate edges using statistics of nodal potentials. Based on the monotonic properties of the flow functions, the key result in this paper shows that if variance of the difference of nodal potentials is used to weight candidate edges, the operational edges form the minimum spanning tree in the loopy graph. Under realistic conditions on the statistics of nodal injection (consumption or production), we provide a greedy structure learning algorithm with quasilinear computational complexity in the number of candidate edges in the network. Our learning framework is very general due to two significant attributes. First it is independent of the specific marginal distributions of nodal potentials and only uses order properties in their second moments. Second, the learning algorithm is agnostic to exact flow functions that relate edge flows to corresponding potential differences and is applicable for a broad class of networks with monotonic flow functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our work through realistic simulations on diverse physical flow networks and discuss possible extensions of our work to other regimes."
2093396,21246,9475,"An interleaved, model-supported system identification scheme for the particle accelerator CLIC",2010,"The particle accelerator CLIC is a future linear collider, which is developed at CERN. The quality of the particle-beams produced by CLIC is very sensitive to ground motion. The efficiency of the feedback used to counteract ground motion, relies crucially on the quality of the system knowledge. Therefore, we present a system identification scheme to follow changes of accelerator parameters. The algorithm is based on the well-known RLS (recursive least squares) algorithm with exponential forgetting, but adds modifications to improve the learning speed and to address excitation on-strains given by the system. Parallel-running, interleaved RLS algorithms identify parts of the overall system. The different results are combined by using a priori knowledge. Parts that could not be identified directly, are extrapolated with the help of physical models. The modified algorithm can follow system changes with a factor of approx. 30 improved learning speed, compared to the conventional RLS algorithm. It works robustly, in spite of sensor noise and disturbances acting on the excitation signals. The prize that has to be paid is a minimum permanent error of 13% due to model errors. The scheme can easily be adapted to other linear accelerators. Moreover it should be possible to reduce the steady-state error of the identification for other machines, since the main linac of CLIC is an especially difficult system to model and excite."
805521,21246,9475,Stable utility design for distributed resource allocation,2014,"The framework of resource allocation games is becoming an increasingly popular modeling choice for distributed control and optimization. In recent years, this approach has evolved into the paradigm of game-theoretic control, which consists of first modeling the interaction between the distributed agents as a strategic form game, and then designing local utility functions for these agents such that the resulting game possesses a stable outcome (e.g., a pure Nash equilibrium) that is efficient (e.g., good “price of anarchy” properties). One then appeals to the large, existing literature on learning in games for distributed algorithms for agents that guarantee convergence to such an equilibrium. An important first problem is to obtain a characterization of stable utility designs, that is, those that guarantee equilibrium existence for a large class of games. Recent work has explored this question in the general, multiselection context, that is, when agents are allowed to choose more than one resource at a time, showing that the only stable utility designs are the so-called “weighted Shapley values”. It remains an open problem to obtain a similar characterization in the single-selection context, which several practical problems such as vehicle target assignment, sensor coverage, etc. fall into. We survey recent work in the multi-selection scenario, and show that even though other utility designs become stable for specific single-selection applications, perhaps surprisingly, in a broader context, the limitation to “weighted Shapley value” utility design continues to prevail."
1023619,21246,9475,Scheduling and cooperative control of electric vehicles' charging at highway service stations,2014,"Due to their limited ranges, electric vehicles (EVs) need to be periodically charged during their long-distance travels on a highway. Compared to the fossil-fuel powered vehicles, the charging of a single EV takes much more time (up to 30 mins versus 2 mins). As the number of EVs on highways increases, adequate charging infrastructure needs to be put in place. Nonetheless waiting times for EVs to get charged at service stations could still vary significantly unless an appropriate scheduling coordination is in place and individual EVs make correct decisions about their choice of charging locations. This paper attempts to address both the system-level scheduling problem and the individual control problem, while requiring only distributed information about EVs and their charging at service stations along a highway. Specifically, we first develop a higher-level distributed scheduling algorithm to optimize the operation of the overall charging network. The scheduling algorithm uses only local information of traffic flows measured at the neighboring service stations (nodes), and it aims at adjusting the percentage of the EVs to be charged at individual stations so that all the charging resources along the highway are well (uniformly) utilized and the total waiting time is minimized. Then, a lower level cooperative control law is designed for individual EVs to decide whether or not it should charge its battery when approaching a specific service station by meeting the published scheduling level while taking into account its own battery constraint. Analytical designs are presented and their performance improvement is illustrated using simulation."
898133,21246,9475,A non-linear MPC based Motion Cueing implementation for a 9 DOFs dynamic simulator platform,2014,"The use of dynamical driving simulators is nowadays common practice in many different application fields, such as driver training, vehicle development, and medical studies. Platforms with different mechanical structure are designed, depending on the particular application and the corresponding targeted market. The effectiveness of such devices is related to their capabilities of well reproducing the driving feelings, hence it is crucial that the motion control strategies generate both realistic and feasible signals to the platform, to assure that it is kept within its limited operation space. Such strategies are called Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs), and they are clearly tailored to the particular mechanical structure of the device. In this paper we describe an MCA based on non linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) techniques for a simulator of new conception, that consists of an hexapod over a flat base moved by a tripod, thus exhibiting highly non linear behaviour. The procedure is based on previous works where a linear, MPC-based MCA has been applied to a simpler device. The algorithm has been evaluated on a simulation environment, and a first implementation on the real device is in progress. Preliminary results show that a full exploitation of the working area is achieved, while managing at best all the limitations given by the particular structure and preserving the ease of tune and intuitiveness of the linear approach."
1401213,21246,20896,A hybrid model predictive controller for path planning and path following,2015,"The use of nonlinear model-predictive methods for path planning and following has the advantage of concurrently solving problems of obstacle avoidance, feasible trajectory selection, and trajectory following, while obeying constraints on control inputs and state values. However, such approaches are computationally intensive, and may not be guaranteed to return a result in bounded time when performing a non-convex optimization. This problem is an interesting application to cyber-physical systems due to their reliance on computation to carry out complex control. The computational burden can be addressed through model reduction, at a cost of potential (bounded) model error over the prediction horizon. In this paper we introduce a metric called uncontrollable divergence, and discuss how the selection of the model to use for the predictive controller can be addressed by evaluating this metric, which reveals the divergence between predicted and true states caused by return time and model mismatch. A map of uncontrollable divergence plotted over the state space gives the criterion to judge where reduced models can be tolerated when high update rate is preferred (e.g. at high speed and small steering angles), and where high-fidelity models are required to avoid obstacles or make tighter curves (e.g. at large steering angles). With this metric, we design a hybrid controller that switches at runtime between predictive controllers in which respective models are deployed."
1325047,21246,9475,Robust quasi-decentralized networked control of process systems,2009,"This paper presents a quasi-decentralized networked control methodology for the robust stabilization of multi-unit plants whose constituent subsystems communicate over a shared resource-constrained communication network and are subject to time-varying external disturbances. The objective is to stabilize the plant while keeping the communication requirements to a minimum in order to reduce the unnecessary utilization of network resources. Initially, a local robust feedback controller is synthesized for each unit to account for the effect of the disturbances. Then the exchange of information between the local control systems is reduced by embedding, within each control system, a set of dynamic models that provide forecasts of the evolution of the plant units when measurements are not transmitted through the shared network, and updating the state of each model when communication is reestablished at discrete time instances. By analyzing the resulting combined discrete-continuous closed-loop system, a necessary and sufficient condition for robust stability of the networked closed-loop plant is obtained. The stability condition can be used to explicitly characterize the interplays between the update period, the degree of plant-model mismatch, the selection of the controller design parameters, the size of the disturbances and the size of the achievable ultimate bound on the close-dloop state. Finally, the implementation of the robust networked control structure is demonstrated through an application to a chemical plant example."
2957444,21246,23735,Preliminary experiments with a unified controller for a powered knee-ankle prosthetic leg across walking speeds,2016,"This paper presents the experimental validation of a novel control strategy that unifies the entire gait cycle of a powered knee-ankle prosthetic leg without the need to switch between controllers for different periods of gait. Current control methods divide the gait cycle into several sequential periods each with independent controllers, resulting in many patient-specific control parameters and switching rules that must be tuned for a specific walking speed. The single controller presented is speed-invariant with a minimal number of control parameters to be tuned. A single, periodic virtual constraint is derived that exactly characterizes the desired actuated joint motion as a function of a mechanical phase variable across walking cycles. A single sensor was used to compute a phase variable related to the residual thigh angle's phase plane, which was recently shown to robustly represent the phase of non-steady human gait. This phase variable allows the prosthesis to synchronize naturally with the human user for intuitive, biomimetic behavior. A custom powered knee-ankle prosthesis was designed and built to implement the control strategy and validate its performance. A human subject experiment was conducted across multiple walking speeds (1 to 3 miles/hour) in a continuous sequence with the single phase-based controller, demonstrating its adaptability to the user's intended speed."
2349062,21246,9475,Adaptive sensor management for feature-based classification,2010,"Modern surveillance systems often employ multiple steerable sensors that are capable of collecting information on selected objects in their environment. In this paper, we study the problem of managing these sensors adaptively to classify a collection of objects using information on their observed features. We develop a new theory for sensor management that models sensors as providing observations of object features subject to degradation by noise, obscuration, missed detections and background clutter. We establish a statistical framework, based on random sets, to characterize the relationship between observed features and object types. This model uses Bhattacharyya distances to generate off-line apriori estimates of the discrimination value of measurements. These estimates are combined with real time information to generate predictions of the usefulness of measurements. Using these predictions, we develop assignment algorithms to compute sensor management strategies. The resulting sensor management algorithms are capable of solving problems involving a large numbers of objects in real-time. We show simulations of the resulting algorithms for classifying 3-dimensional objects from 2-dimensional noisy projections, and show how the algorithms select complementary views to overcome obscuration and provide accurate classification. Our real-time algorithms achieve comparable classification accuracy to on-line approaches that also evaluate the value of information, while requiring nearly five orders of magnitude less computation."
1068335,21246,9475,Nonlinear MPC of HIV-1 infection with periodic inputs,2011,"Although many papers address the issue of therapy design for HIV-1 infection based on control methods, the results available in the literature do not in general consider the fact that the manipulated variable is not continuous but a train of pulses. In addition, they are usually concerned only with the relation between drug effect (assumed to be manipulated) and virus dynamics. In order to improve the direct relation with actual clinical practice, the present work takes as manipulated variable a train of impulses that represent the pills taken by the patient and includes pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) drug models. In addition, patient adherence to treatment and their impact on virus drug resistance is also modeled. The problem of driving the viral load to a low specified value while minimizing the amount of drugs administered to the patient is thus addressed by nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with periodic inputs. Therefore, the paper contributions consist in the characterization of the results obtained with this type of control strategy in a HIV-1 infection model comprising drug PK and PD, development of virus resistance to drugs and virus dynamics. Furthermore, it is shown that various amounts of reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) and protease inhibitor (PI) drugs can be given depending on the weights of the cost function minimized by periodic NMPC, while attaining the same control objective. It is proposed that these weights can be adjusted to minimize the toxicity of the drug cocktail administered."
2968678,21246,9475,Online adaptive bank of recursive least square estimators for slowly time-varying and abruptly changing systems,2016,"Many real world problems can be modeled by a linear Gaussian model with a slowly time-varying and abruptly changing regression coefficient (called the state). However, some practical applications don't allow us to get complete knowledge of state dynamics parameters a priori. We address state estimation of the linear Gaussian model whose state dynamics is represented by a special case of switched linear systems. We also present a new multiple model method with an online adaptive model set (called the bank) for estimating the state without knowing the parameters a priori. The method is based on recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms and switching detection. The bank consists of RLS algorithm modulated estimators. Each estimator adapts to each elemental linear system. A new estimator is generated and added to the bank every time a switching among the linear systems is detected. The state is estimated as a mixture of bank element estimations weighted by a posterior distribution of the elements. In terms of computational efficiency, the new estimator is generated in closed form and the posterior distribution, that is a non-convex function, is approximated as a discrete distribution with a small number of bins. Computer simulations show that our online bank adaptation method improves state estimation accuracy of a baseline method that don't employ online bank adaptation, and our multiple model method requires less computational resources to achieve a practicable state estimation than conventional multiple model methods that employ online Kalman Filter bank adaptation."
1532418,21246,9475,Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Stabilizability subject to Quadratic Invariance,2011,"In this paper we deal with the problem of stabilizing linear, time-invariant plants using feedback control configurations that are subject to sparsity constraints. Recent results show that given a strongly stabilizable plant, the class of all stabilizing controllers that satisfy certain given sparsity constraints admits a convex representation via Zames's Q-parametrization. More precisely, if the pre-specified sparsity constraints imposed on the controller are quadratically invariant with respect to the plant, then such a convex representation is guaranteed to exist. The most useful feature of the aforementioned results is that the sparsity constraints on the controller can be recast as convex constraints on the Q-parameter, which makes this approach suitable for optimal controller design (in the ℋ 2  sense) using numerical tools readily available from the classical, centralized optimal ℋ 2  synthesis. All these procedures rely crucially on the fact that some stabilizing controller that verifies the imposed sparsity constraints is a priori known, while design procedures for such a controller to initialize the aforementioned optimization schemes are not yet available. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for such a plant to be stabilizable with a controller having the given sparsity pattern. These conditions are formulated in terms of the existence of a doubly coprime factorization of the plant with additional sparsity constraints on certain factors. We show that the computation of such a factorization is equivalent to solving an exact model-matching problem. We also give the parametrization of the set of all decentralized stabilizing controllers by imposing additional constraints on the Youla parameter. These constraints are for the Youla parameter to lie in the set of all stable transfer function matrices belonging to a certain linear subspace."
2513374,21246,9475,Using point process models to determine the impact of visual cues on basal ganglia activity and behavior of Parkinson's patients,2009,"Deep brain stimulation is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) that has enabled microelectrode recordings from single-unit cells in the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia. This rare data is important to develop detailed characterizations of spiking activity to understand the pathophysiology of PD. Despite the point process nature of neuronal spiking activity, point process (PP) methods are not used to analyze these recordings. Therefore, we develop PP models using the generalized linear method to characterize spiking activity in 28 STN neurons in 7 PD patients executing a two-step motor task. In the first step of the task, patients could anticipate visual go cues and moved once prompted. In the second step of the task, go cues had a 50% chance of appearing. If cues failed to appear, movements were self-initiated. The point process models provide an accurate summary of pathological characteristics under different cued conditions such as bursting, 10–30Hz oscillations, and fluctuations in directional tuning. In particular, the models show that when cues can be anticipated or when patients self-initiate movements (in both cases an internal motor plan is formed prior to movement), pathological neural characteristics are suppressed. In contrast, when cues cannot be anticipated and later appear, there is no suppression of pathological neural characteristics. Consequently, movements deteriorate."
2477309,21246,9475,Nonlinear predictive control for the management of container flows in maritime intermodal terminals,2008,"The increase of efficiency in the management of container terminals is addressed via a predictive control approach to allocate the available handling resources. The predictive control action results from the minimization of a performance cost function that measures the lay times of carriers over a forward horizon. Such an approach to predictive control is based on a model of container flows inside a terminal as a system of queues. Binary variables are included into the model to represent the events of departure or stay of a carrier, thus the proposed approach requires the on-line solution of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Two techniques for solving such a problem are proposed that account for the presence of binary variables as well as nonlinearities into the model and the cost function. The first relies on the application of a standard branch-and-bound algorithm. The second is based on the idea of dealing with the decisions associated with the binary variables as step functions. In this case, real nonlinear programming techniques are used to find a solution. Finally, a third approach is proposed that is based on the idea of approximating off line the feedback control laws that result from the application of the two previous approaches. The approximation is made using a neural network, which allows one to construct an approximate feedback control law and generate the corresponding on-line control action with a small computational burden. Simulation results are reported to compare such methodologies."
2143483,21246,9475,New results in dissipativity of uncontrollable systems and Lyapunov functions,2009,"Dissipative systems have played an important role in the analysis and synthesis of dynamical systems. The commonly used definition of dissipativity often requires an assumption on the controllability of the system. However, it is very natural to think of Lyapunov functions as storage functions for autonomous systems with power supplied to the system equal to zero. We use a definition of dissipativity that is slightly different (and less often used in the literature) to study a linear, time-invariant, possibly uncontrollable dynamical system. This paper contains various results in the context of uncontrollable dissipative systems that smoothly bridge the gap between storage functions for controllable dissipative systems and Lyapunov functions for autonomous systems. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an uncontrollable system to be strictly dissipative with respect to a supply rate under the assumption that the uncontrollable poles are not “mixed”; i.e., no pair of uncontrollable poles is symmetric about the imaginary axis: this condition is known to be related to the solvability of a Lyapunov equation. We show that for an uncontrollable system the set of storage functions is unbounded, and that the unboundedness arises precisely due to the set of Lyapunov functions for an autonomous linear system being unbounded. Further, we show that stabilizability of a system results in this unbounded set becoming bounded from below. Positivity of storage functions is known to be very important for stability considerations because the maximum stored energy that can be drawn out is bounded when the storage function is positive. In this paper we establish the link between stabilizability of an uncontrollable system and existence of positive definite storage functions. In the context of autonomous systems, we prove that the Lyapunov operator is onto if and only if its image has observable symmetric rank one matrices."
2930804,21246,9475,Consensus speed optimisation with finite leadership perturbation in k-nearest neighbour networks,2016,"Near-optimal convergence speeds are found for perturbed networked systems, with N interacting agents that conform to k-nearest neighbour (k-NNR) connection rules, by allocating a finite leadership resource amongst selected nodes. These nodes continue averaging their state with that of their neighbours while being provided with the resources to drive the network to a new state. Such systems are represented by a directed graph Laplacian with two newly presented semi-analytical approaches used to maximise the consensus speed. The two methods developed typically produce near-optimal results and are highly efficient when compared with conventional numerical optimisation, where the asymptotic computational complexity is O(n3) and O(n4) respectively. The upper limit for the convergence speed of a perturbed k-NNR network is identified as the largest element of the first left eigenvector (FLE) of a graph's adjacency matrix. The first semi-analytical method exploits this knowledge by distributing leadership resources amongst the most prominent nodes highlighted by this FLE. The second method relies on the FLEs of manipulated versions of the adjacency matrix to expose different communities of influential nodes. These are shown to correspond with the communities found by the Leicht-Newman detection algorithm, with this method enabling optimal leadership selection even in low outdegree (< 12 connections) graphs, where the first semi-analytical method is less effective."
1666540,21246,9475,Bifurcation analysis points towards the source of beta neuronal oscillations in Parkinson's disease,2011,"Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer, affecting 0.16% of the population in the USA 1 . This disease is most common in the elderly, what makes it a prominent health problem in developed countries, where the elder population is expected to importantly increase in the future. The mechanism generating the disease is the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a small brain region from the brain stem. These neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine to the basal ganglia, a large and complex brain structure implicated in motor control and reinforcement learning. Once SNc neurons have died, the basal ganglia starts showing prominent features of malfunction, and the characteristics symptoms of Parkinson's disease began to be observed in the patient (i.e. general difficulty or inability to execute motor movements and limb tremor, among others). Modern theory of Parkinson's disease focuses on the abnormal brain activity oscillations observed in the basal ganglia, which are consistently observed in parkinsonian patients and correlate with their symptoms. This paper develops a mathematical model of the basal ganglia, which reproduces the experimentally recorded neuronal activity of this brain structure in health and disease. Studying this model numerical and analytically, we draw conclusion on how and where these oscillations are generated within the brain. If the conclusions of this mathematical model are further confirmed experimentally, we think they pave the way towards controlling such oscillations pharmacologically or through electrode stimulation in the future."
1831379,21246,9475,Finite time stabilization of a perturbed double integrator - Part II: applications to bipedal locomotion,2010,"Orbital stabilization of a bipedal robot. The robot walk is composed of single support phases separated by impacts. The underactuation degree of the robot is one during the single support phase. The generalized positions are assumed to be the only available measurements of the robot state. The proposed synthesis procedure is constituted by several successive designs which are developed step by step. At the first step, the generalized position θ of the virtual leg that would correspond to a three-link biped with no knees is viewed as a time substitution θ(t) and the desired path is obtained as a function of θ rather than that of time. Second, the underactuated orbital stabilization problem is reduced to stabilization of the geometric configuration evolution of the robot with a supplementary control input, being the second order time derivative Ӫ of the virtual leg position. The original orbital stabilization problem is thus decoupled to a path stabilization of five double integrators, controlled independently. At the third and fourth steps, the so-called twisting and supertwisting algorithms, which are well-recognized for their finite time stability and robustness properties, are modified to present, respectively, the state feedback controller and velocity observer, developed for the finite time stabilization of a double integrator. Finally, the resulting position feedback synthesis is composed to orbitally stabilize the five-link bipedal robot. Performance and robustness issues of the enforced biped cyclic gate are illustrated in a numerical study.  1"
552065,21246,9475,Non-linear PI control inspired by biological control systems,1998,"A non-linear modification to PI control has been developed which is appropriate for plants requiring exact set-point matching and disturbance attenuation in the presence of infrequent step changes in load disturbances or set-point. This novel control algorithm, labeled PII (proportional with intermittent integral), is motivated by a model of a signal transduction pathway active in mammalian blood pressure regulation. It is possible that set-point regulation and disturbance rejection are achieved through independent control loops in mammals. This control paradigm implements, somewhat independently, two control loops to achieve the goals of disturbance attenuation and set-point matching. By developing a disturbance rejection controller with no consideration of set-point matching, it is possible to design for greater disturbance attenuation. As a first step, the disturbance attenuator is a simple proportional controller, and set-point matching will be achieved by intermittently invoking an integral controller. The mechanisms observed in a neuronal signal transduction model are used to tie these controllers together. Superior performance of this approach as compared to traditional PI control has been shown on models of level control loops and cyclopentenol production in a CSTR reactor. The cyclopentenol process contains a maximum steady-state production level. PI control cannot be used at this peak operating point as the sign change in plant gain results in an unstable closed-loop system. Application of this new approach to this problem results in stable exact setpoint matching for achievable set-points."
1479455,21246,9475,On Nash equilibria in duopolistic power markets subject to make-whole uplift,2012,"We consider a duopolistic power market in which firms bid their offer functions while abiding by capacity constraints. Minimal cost allocation decisions and marginal cost prices are determined through the solution of two optimization problems, the first a mixed-integer linear program (the unit commitment problem) and the second a related linear program (the economic dispatch problem) that has constraints derived from the solution of the commitmemt problem. Traditional marginal-cost pricing mechanisms have relied on using the dual variables associated with the supply-demand constraints from the dispatch problem. Unfortunately, such mechanisms fail to cover the cost of start-up and energy costs faced by dispatched generators. In existing markets, one attempt at a remedy is by providing every dispatched generator with an expost out of market settlement called a make-whole uplift. Given the presence of such an uplift mechanism, this paper seeks to characterize the nature of equilibria in duopolistic settings. The two main conclusions of our analysis are: 1) Pure Nash equilibria are identified when one firm can supply the entire demand; 2) Otherwise, it is shown that mixed-strategy Nash equilibria exist, and these equilibria can be characterized by two coupled differential equations. These results provide a framework for further analysis of electricity markets, and in particular the true value of make-whole uplift payments in a strategic setting."
1479530,21246,9475,Approximate Dynamic Programming with (min; +) linear function approximation for Markov decision processes,2014,"Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a useful framework to study problems of optimal sequential decision making under uncertainty. Given any MDP the aim here is to find the optimal action selection mechanism i.e., the optimal policy. Typically, the optimal policy (u*) is obtained by substituting the optimal value-function (J*) in the Bellman equation. Alternatively, u* is also obtained by learning the optimal state-action value function Q* known as the Q value-function. However, it is difficult to compute the exact values of J* or Q* for MDPs with large number of states. Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods address this difficulty by computing lower dimensional approximations of J*/Q*. Most ADP methods employ linear function approximation (LFA), i.e., the approximate solution lies in a subspace spanned by a family of pre-selected basis functions. The approximation is obtained via a linear least squares projection of higher dimensional quantities and the L 2  norm plays an important role in convergence and error analysis. In this paper, we discuss ADP methods for MDPs based on LFAs in the (min; +) algebra. Here the approximate solution is a (min; +) linear combination of a set of basis functions whose span constitutes a subsemimodule. Approximation is obtained via a projection operator onto the subsemimodule which is different from linear least squares projection used in ADP methods based on conventional LFAs. MDPs are not (min; +) linear systems, nevertheless, we show that the monotonicity property of the projection operator helps us establish the convergence of our ADP schemes. We also discuss future directions in ADP methods for MDPs based on the (min; +) LFAs."
1361815,21246,9475,Robust model-free formation control with prescribed performance and connectivity maintenance for nonlinear multi-agent systems,2014,"In this paper, we consider the formation control problem for a generic class of first-order nonlinear multi-agent systems, under an undirected communication model and connectivity constraints. More specifically, we design a decentralized model-free control protocol in the sense that each agent utilizes only local relative state information from its neighborhood set to calculate its own control signal, without incorporating any prior knowledge of the model nonlinearities/disturbances or any approximation structures to acquire such knowledge. Assuming that initially the graph is strongly connected, the proposed scheme guarantees that all initial communication links are maintained, that is all pairs of agents, initially forming an edge in the graph, remain within a distance representing the communication capabilities of the agents, preserving thus the strong connectiveness for all time. Additionally, the transient and steady state response is solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions and is fully decoupled by the agents' dynamic model, the underlying graph topology and the control gains selection, which further relaxes the control design procedure. Finally, the proposed methodology results in a low complexity design. Actually, it is a static scheme involving very few and simple calculations to output the control signal, thus making its distributed implementation straightforward."
2903780,21246,9475,A dynamical systems approach to obstacle navigation for a series-elastic hexapod robot,2016,"This paper emphasizes reliability in designing controllers to enable a blind, modular series-elastic hexapod robot to autonomously navigate (climb over) obstacles such as steps and curbs. Specifically, we suggest that it is not only important to limit the complexity of controllers, but also to limit the number of operating controllers to reduce potential failure points. As such, this paper presents a two-tiered control scheme with a high-level behavioral and a mid-level, modified admittance controller. The behavioral controller, based on a dynamical systems approach, is easy to implement - it is modelless, and may be realized using only analog circuitry. At its core, two oscillators coordinate the phasing of the robot's legs in open loop for nominal locomotion and climbing behaviors. A simple bistable dynamical system accepts torque feedback to decide the active mode and smoothly transition between behaviors - an alternating tripod gait for nominal walking and a quadrupedal gait in climbing mode. Finally, the mid-level, modified admittance controller naturally generates discrete motions as a byproduct of regulating compliant interactions. The proposed controller avoids unnecessary complexities that would be required in switching between discrete motion controllers or primitives in a state machine. It allows the robot to adapt to different obstacle heights while minimizing open parameters."
1204260,21246,9475,Voltage stabilization in microgrids via quadratic droop control,2013,"Motivated by the growing interest in energy technology and smart grid architectures, we consider the problem of voltage stability and reactive power balancing in low-voltage electrical networks equipped with DC/AC inverters (“microgrids”). It is generally believed that high-voltage equilibria of such networks are stable, but the locations of these equilibria are unknown, as is the critical network load where stability is lost. Inspired by the “control by interconnection” paradigm developed for port-Hamiltonian systems, we propose a novel droop-like inverter controller which is quadratic in the local voltage magnitude. Remarkably, under this controller the closed-loop network is again a well-posed electrical circuit. We find that the equilibria of the quadratic droop-controlled network are in exact correspondence with the solutions of a reduced power flow equation. For general network topologies, we study some simple yet insightful solutions of this equation, and for the frequently-encountered case of a parallel microgrid, we present a concise and closed-form condition for the existence of an exponentially stable high-voltage network equilibrium. Our condition establishes the existence of a critical inductive load for the network, which depends only on the network topology, admittances, and controller gains. We compare and contrast our design with the conventional droop controller, investigate the relationship between the two, and validate the robustness of our design through simulation."
2394699,21246,9475,High speed inverse model implementation for real-time control of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic transducers operating in nonlinear and hysteretic regimes,2007,"Ferroelectric (e.g., PZT), ferromagnetic, and ferroelastic (e.g., shape memory alloy) materials exhibit varying degrees of hysteresis and constitutive nonlinearities at all drive levels due to their inherent domain structure. At low drive levels, these nonlinear effects can be mitigated through feedback mechanisms or certain amplifier architectures (e.g., charge or current control for PZT) so that linear models and control designs provide sufficient accuracy. However, at the moderate to high drive levels where actuators and sensors utilizing these compounds often prove advantageous, hysteresis and constitutive nonlinearities must be incorporated into models and control designs to achieve high accuracy, high speed control specifications. In this paper, we employ a homogenized energy framework to characterize hysteresis in this combined class of ferroic compounds. We then use this framework to construct highly efficient inverse models that can be used to approximately linearize actuator dynamics for subsequent linear control design. For applications such as high speed tracking (e.g., kHz rates) or broadband vibration attenuation, the efficiency of the inverse construction proves crucial for realtime control implementation. We demonstrate aspects of the inverse model implementation in the context of rod models used to characterize PZT and magnetic actuators presently employed in applications ranging from nanopositioning to high speed milling of automotive components."
2370175,21246,9475,Robust partial pole assignment for vibrating systems with aerodynamic effects,2004,"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for robust partial eigenvalue assignment (RPEVA) problem for a cubic matrix pencil arising from modeling of vibrating systems with aerodynamic effects. The RPEVA problem for a cubic pencil is the one of choosing suitable feedback matrices to reassign a few (say k < 3n) unwanted eigenvalues while leaving the remaining large number (3n - k) of them unchanged, in such a way that the the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix are as insensitive as possible to small perturbation of the data. The latter amounts to minimizing the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvector matrix. The problem is solved directly in the cubic matrix polynomial setting without making any transformation to a standard first-order state-space system. This allows us to take advantage of the exploitable structures such as the sparsity, definiteness, bandness, etc., very often offered by large practical problems. The major computational requirements are: (i)solutions of a small Sylvester equation, (ii) QR factorizations, and (iii) solutions or some standard least squares problems. The least-squares problems result from matrix rank-one and rank-two update techniques used in the algorithm for reassigning, respectively, simple and complex eigenvalues. The practical effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by implementational results on simulated data provided by the Boeing company."
1054802,21246,9475,Information weighted consensus,2012,"Consensus-based distributed estimation schemes are becoming increasingly popular in sensor networks due to their scalability and fault tolerance capabilities. In a consensus-based state estimation framework, multiple neighboring nodes iteratively communicate with each other, exchanging their own local estimates of a target's state with the goal of converging to a single state estimate over the entire network. However, the state estimation problem becomes challenging when a node has limited observability of the state. In addition, the consensus estimate is sub-optimal when the cross-covariances between the individual state estimates across different nodes are not incorporated in the distributed estimation framework. The cross-covariance is usually neglected because the computational and bandwidth requirements for its computation grow exponentially with the number of nodes. These limitations can be overcome by noting that, as the state estimates at different nodes converge, the information at each node becomes redundant. This fact can be utilized to compute the optimal estimate by proper weighting of the prior state and measurement information. Motivated by this idea, we propose information-weighted consensus algorithms for distributed maximum a posteriori parameter estimates, and their extension to the information-weighted consensus filter (ICF) for state estimation. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the proposed methods asymptotically approach the optimal centralized performance. Simulation results show that ICF is robust even when the optimality conditions are not met and has low communication requirements."
715290,21246,9475,A max-plus based randomized algorithm for solving a class of HJB PDEs,2014,"McEneaney introduced the curse of dimensionality free method for the special class of infinite horizon optimal control problems where the Hamiltonian is represented as a maximum of quadratic affine functions. This method is featured by its cubic complexity with respect to the state space dimension, but the number of basis functions is multiplied by the number of switches at each iteration, referred to as the ‘curse of complexity’. In previous works, an SDP-based pruning technique was incorporated into the method in order to reduce the curse of complexity. Its efficiency was proved on many examples. In this paper we develop a new max-plus based randomized algorithm to solve the same class of infinite horizon optimal control problems. The major difference between the new algorithm and the previous SDP-based curse of dimensionality free method is that, instead of adding a large number of functions and then pruning the less useful ones, the new algorithm finds in cheap computation time (linear in the current number of basis functions), by a randomized procedure, useful quadratic functions and adds only those functions to the set of basis functions. Experimental results show that the max-plus randomized algorithm can reach the same precision order obtained by the SDP-based method with a speedup varying from 10 up to 100 and that the maximal precision order attainable by the new algorithm is much better than what can be done by the SDP-based algorithm in reasonable computation time. Besides, with the randomized algorithm we are now able to tackle switched problems with more number of switches, which will allow us to extend the algorithm to more general classes of optimal control problems."
2670507,21246,9475,Nonholonomic virtual constraints for dynamic walking,2015,"Virtual constraints are functional relations (i.e., constraints) on the state variables of a robot's model that are achieved through the action of actuators and feedback control instead of physical contact forces. They are called virtual because they can be re-programmed on the fly without modifying any physical connections among the links of the robot or its environment. Previous analytical and experimental work has established that vector relative degree two virtual holonomic (i.e., only configuration dependent) constraints are a powerful means to synchronize the links of a bipedal robot so as to achieve walking and running motions over a variety of terrain profiles. This paper introduces a class of virtual nonholonomic constraints that depend on velocity through (generalized) angular momentum while maintaining the property of being relative degree two. This additional freedom is shown to yield control solutions that handle a wider range of gait perturbations arising from terrain variations and exogenous forces. Moreover, including angular momentum in the virtual constraints allows foot placement control to be rigorously designed on the basis of the full dynamic model of the biped, instead of on the basis of an inverted pendulum approximation of its center of mass, as is commonly done in the bipedal robotics literature. This new class of control laws is shown in simulation to be robust to a variety of common gait disturbances."
2700985,21246,9475,Efficient simulation of transient gas networks using IMEX integration schemes and MOR methods,2015,"Modeling and Simulation of fluids in large networks are challenging problems. We provide an approach combining techniques in Model Order Reduction (MOR) and implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration to create efficient and stable simulations. Systems of gas flow in pipe networks are modeled as hyperbolic partial differential algebraic equations, which results after spatial discretization, in a nonlinear differential algebraic system. Standard techniques are slow in the best case, where in the worst case they are not even applicable to the system. This is due to several properties of said system, starting with the fact that it is a differential algebraic system, that it is nonlinear, and stiff. A first and major step in order to achieve stable and fast simulators for these problems is what we call the decoupling step. In that step, we are able to extract an ordinary differential equation which describes the inherent dynamic of the model. This step is only possible due to the chosen spatial discretization we use. Next, we use a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) together with implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration method to reduce the size of the states and the number of time-steps. Using an integration method tailored to the problem is essential to being able to create transient simulation within a reasonable computation time. MOR methods, which further reduce the computation time are particularly important if we are interested in an optimization problem."
1068608,21246,9475,Viability and analysis of implementing only voltage-power droop for parallel inverter systems,2014,"In microgrids that are predominantly resistive, real and reactive power can be controlled by implementation of voltage and frequency droop laws respectively. However, the variable frequency displayed by such a system complicates analysis such that design approaches rely on approximations and linearized models. In this work, we present a modified form of droop control where only the voltage versus real power relationship is upheld and the frequency is held constant. Since the frequency is not explicitly controlled and the reactive power is not measured, the controller can be simplified. In such a setting, the only assumption we make is that all inverters have access to a common time-reference. Because fixed frequency operation is enforced by design, a variety of analytical tools can be leveraged to formulate a comprehensive analytical framework which facilitates a precise design methodology. In particular, closed-form expressions on the output current phase differences are obtained which yield practical selection guidelines on the voltage-power droop gains such that reactive flows between inverters are kept small. As a corollary, it is demonstrated that there are no reactive power flows in the presence of purely resistive loads. For the particular case of a single inverter, an almost exact solution describing the nonlinear dynamics of the inverter output voltage, current, and power are derived. Accompanying simulation results validate the analytical results and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control approach."
2501932,21246,9475,Economic COP optimization of a heat pump with hierarchical model predictive control,2012,"A low-temperature heating system is studied in this paper. It consists of hydronic under-floor heating pipes and an air/ground source heat pump. The heat pump in such a setup is conventionally controlled only by feed-forwarding the ambient temperature. Having shown >10% cut-down on electricity bills by involving feedback control in a previous study, this paper has continued the same line of argument and has investigated effects of a priori knowledge on weather forecast and electricity price profile to alleviate the total electricity cost subject to constraints on resident's thermal comfort. A two level hierarchical control structure is chosen for this purpose. While local PI controllers at the bottom level maintain individual temperature set-points of the rooms, a model predictive controller at the top level minimizes water supply temperature, and hence maximizes the heat pump's coefficient of performance. At the same time, it determines the actual temperature set-points of the rooms by deviating from the user-defined set-points within a thermal tolerance zone. Simulations results confirm significant cut-down on electricity bills without sacrificing resident thermal comfort. The proposed control strategy is a leap forward towards balanced load control in Smart Grids where individual heat pumps in detached houses contribute to preserve load balance through intelligent electricity pricing policies."
2968666,21246,9475,A generalized Frank-wolfe approach to decentralized electric vehicle charging,2016,"The uncoordinated charging of large electric vehicle (EV) fleets could have an adverse influence on power network operation. To guarantee the secure and economic operation of power grids, vehicle charging needs to be coordinated to minimize the power supply cost, while catering vehicle charging requests. Provisioning large-scale fleets scheduled at fine timescales, the task of EV scheduling is tackled here by properly adopting the Frank-Wolfe method. Upon devising an optimal step size rule, the novel scheme is shown to enjoy fast convergence rate, especially during the first iterations. The derived charging protocol features affordable computational requirements from vehicle controllers and minimal information exchange between vehicles and their aggregator. To cope with random cyber delays in the communication links between vehicles and the aggregator, an asynchronous version of the charging scheme is also studied. Interpreted as a block stochastic Frank Wolfe algorithm, the latter ensures feasibility across iterations, converges in the mean, and enjoys the same order of convergence rate attained by its synchronous counterpart. Numerical tests demonstrate the advantage of our deterministic scheme over a state-of-the-art projected gradient descent alternative, as well as the robustness of its stochastic counterpart to asynchronous updates."
1362999,21246,8441,Adaptive circadian argument estimator and its application to circadian argument control,2013,"Disruption of the circadian rhythm is detrimental to human well being, with consequences ranging from lower productivity, sleep disorder, to more serious health problems. Accurate estimation of circadian argument is critical to the assessment and treatment of circadian disruption. Circadian argument estimate is also essential for light-based circadian entrainment. Direct measurements of circadian rhythm markers such as dim light melatonin onset are inconvenient and acquired at best at low rate. Wearable continuous measurement such as actigraph is convenient but is masked by many other factors. In this paper, we present a new circadian rhythm estimation scheme based on a type of frequency tracker, called adaptive notch filter (ANF) which is commonly used in signal processing. ANF is designed to track the gain and phase of a single sinusoid from noisy data. We extend the classic ANF to multiple harmonics needed in circadian rhythm tracking. The local stability and high order harmonics robustness are analyzed. The highly noisy indirect measurements result in unreliable amplitude estimate, but the phase estimate is generally quite robust. We use this phase estimate combined with the light input to construct a black-box linear time varying (LPV) system description, parameterized by the phase estimate. The LPV model predicts the circadian rhythm response to light inputs and can be used for the design of light-based feedback control. The proposed modeling and control method is applied to three different models of circadian rhythm: Kronauer's human circadian model, Leloup's Drosophila circadian model and Neurospora circadian model. Simulation shows that our approach can generate reliable circadian argument estimation and effective gain-scheduled control of the circadian rhythm without any knowledge of the underlying model. The ability to generate circadian estimate, model, and control based only on input/output data opens up the tantalizing possibility of personalized circadian rhythm estimator and light therapy."
2622137,21246,9475,Analysis of undirected formation shape control with directional mismatch,2015,"A typical formation shape control problem involves point agents sensing relative positions, i.e. directions and distances, of their neighbors and then moving so that these relative positions achieve some prespecified values. Such a procedure requiring as it does sensing of directions implicitly presupposes that all agents have a shared understanding of the direction of north. On the other hand, there may be biases in sensors, variations in the earths magnetic field interfering with compass-based sensing, or drift in inertial sensors, with the result that directions are inconsistently measured or measured with error. This paper considers the consequences of this error, considering first the two agent case in a two-dimensional plane. We show that the agents converge to a fixed, but distorted formation exponentially fast. In contrast to the matched case, the formation is not asymptotically stationary, but rather instead translates with a certain constant velocity. The distance error and the angular error between the actual final formation and the desired formation are explicitly given, as well as the steady state velocity of the formation. Based on the results, estimation algorithm is given to obtain the mismatch angle, which allows a compensation algorithm to be proposed such that the desired formation is achieved with zero steady-state velocity for the formation as a whole. The case of the three-dimensional ambient space is then considered and similar phenomena are observed. Simulations are also provided to validate the theoretical results."
1720970,21246,9475,A majorization-minimization approach to design of power transmission networks,2010,"We propose an optimization approach to design cost-effective electrical power transmission networks. That is, we aim to select both the network structure and the line conductances (line sizes) so as to optimize the trade-off between network efficiency (low power dissipation within the transmission network) and the cost to build the network. We begin with a convex optimization method based on the paper “Minimizing Effective Resistance of a Graph” [Ghosh, Boyd & Saberi]. We show that this (DC) resistive network method can be adapted to the context of AC power flow. However, that does not address the combinatorial aspect of selecting network structure. We approach this problem as selecting a subgraph within an over-complete network, posed as minimizing the (convex) network power dissipation plus a non-convex cost on line conductances that encourages sparse networks where many line conductances are set to zero. We develop a heuristic approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem using: (1) a continuation method to interpolate from the smooth, convex problem to the (non-smooth, non-convex) combinatorial problem, (2) the majorization-minimization algorithm to perform the necessary intermediate smooth but non-convex optimization steps. Ultimately, this involves solving a sequence of convex optimization problems in which we iteratively reweight a linear cost on line conductances to fit the actual non-convex cost. Several examples are presented which suggest that the overall method is a good heuristic for network design. We also consider how to obtain sparse networks that are still robust against failures of lines and/or generators."
2695776,21246,9475,Adiabatic elimination for open quantum systems with effective Lindblad master equations,2016,"We consider an open quantum system described by a Lindblad-type master equation with two time scales. The fast time scale is strongly dissipative and drives the system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free space. To perform the adiabatic elimination of this fast relaxation, we propose a geometric asymptotic expansion based on the small positive parameter describing the time scale separation. This expansion exploits geometric singular perturbation theory and center-manifold techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it provides an effective slow Lindblad master equation and a completely positive parameterization of the slow invariant sub-manifold associated to the low-dimensional decoherence-free space. By preserving complete positivity and trace, two important structural properties attached to open quantum dynamics, we obtain a reduced-order model that directly conveys a physical interpretation since it relies on effective Lindbladian descriptions of the slow evolution. At the first order, we derive simple formulae for the effective Lindblad master equation. For a specific type of fast dissipation, we show how any Hamiltonian perturbation yields Lindbladian second-order corrections to the first-order slow evolution governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results are illustrated on a composite system made of a strongly dissipative harmonic oscillator, the ancilla, weakly coupled to another quantum system."
2121912,21246,9475,"Design, optimization, analysis and control topics in nanotechnology ad MEMS courses",2007,"This paper discusses the use of a systems theory, design coverage and control topics in nanotechnology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) courses developed and offered in the College of Engineering in RIT. The multidisciplinary nano and microengineering have accomplished a phenomenal growth over the last twenty years due to the rapid advances in microelectronics, molecular technologies, bulk and surface micromachining, computer-aided-design (CAD), etc. Recent fundamental and applied research and developments in molecular electronics and informatics have been notably contributed to the current progress. Enabling nano/micro engineering utilizes and depends on the fundamentals, software and hardware. These prominent developments largely depend on modern engineering and science providing the end-users with the needed technologies and design concurrency. With the increasing demands in high-performance envisioned nanosystems and emerged microsystems, designers apply new concepts. The role of nanotechnology and MEMS courses in the engineering curriculum is examined. We discuss the integration of design, optimization, control and analysis topics in Nano Science, Engineering and Technology (NanoSET) and MEMS courses. The MEMS curriculum consists of three courses, e.g., MEMS design, MEMS fabrication and MEMS systems evaluation. We stress the need for systems theory, in addition to basic fundamentals coverage and fabrication emphasis. The developed courses ensure the overall educational, professional and curriculum objectives."
2314387,21246,9475,Stable emergent agent distributions under sensing and travel delays,2008,"In order for a team of cooperating agents to achieve a group goal (such as searching for targets, monitoring an environment, etc.) those agents must be able to share information and achieve some level of coordination. Since realistic methods of communication between agents have limited range and speed, the agents? decision-making strategies must operate with incomplete and outdated information. Moreover, in many situations the agents must travel to particular locations in order to perform various tasks, and so there will also be a delay between any particular decision and its effect. In this paper we develop an asynchronous framework that models the behavior of a group of agents that is spatially distributed across a predefined area of interest. We derive general conditions under which the group is guaranteed to converge to a specific distribution within the environment without any form of central control and despite unknown but bounded delays in sensing and travel. The achieved distribution is optimal in the sense that the proportion of agents allocated over each area matches the relative importance of that area. Finally, based on the derived conditions, we design a cooperative control scheme for a multi-agent surveillance problem. Via Monte Carlo simulations we show how sensing and travel delays and the degree of cooperation between agents affect the rate at which they achieve the desired coverage of the region under surveillance."
1391263,21246,8441,Regulation of a controlled Burgers' equation: Tracking and disturbance rejection for general time dependent signals,2013,"In this paper we describe a significant extension of our earlier work on design of feedback laws for regulation of nonlinear distributed parameter systems. In our previous work we presented a technique that was primarily applicable for set-point control. This method was based on the geometric theory of output regulation. In this paper we show that a generalization, motivated by the same theory, can be derived to design feedback laws for solving regulation problems for very general time dependent reference and disturbance signals. In this work the usual assumptions used in the geometric theory do not strictly apply, but nevertheless, we show that some analogs of the regulator equations from the geometric theory can be derived and used to obtain accurate approximations of the control inputs. We note that this methodology is not a simple extension of the set point tracking problem. In particular the infinite dimensional controller involves the solution of a singular DAE. An important part of this work is the development of an iterative regularization scheme that is used to obtain a sequence of time dependent control laws which provide an approximate solution of the regulation problem. Rather than attempt to address the general abstract theory, we demonstrate the method for a multi-input multi-output regulation problem which involves a tracking/disturbance rejection problem for a nonlinear distributed parameter system governed by a one dimensional viscous Burgers' equation. This work represents a significant advance over our earlier work, allowing tracking and disturbance rejection for very general time dependent signals."
2946155,21246,9475,Design of a fuel economy oriented vehicle longitudinal speed controller with optimal gear sequence,2016,"In this paper, a vehicle speed controller aiming at minimizing fuel consumption in car-following scenarios is developed. The optimal longitudinal control of torque and brake is calculated and applied under Model Predictive Control (MPC). For a given car-following distance modulation range, the controller searches for the optimal gear selection at each step in the prediction horizon to generate the minimum fuel control, and triggers gear shifts optimally by vehicle state. The search process with optimality in torque, brake, and gear all ensured is originally highly time consuming. However, in this study, a cooperative method is developed to achieve the optimal solution in real time. The numerically complicated problem is partitioned into a series of simplified subproblems by a deduction method. Fast quasi-optimal solutions are given to the subproblems using an optimal driving pattern derived by Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP). To solve for different speed scenarios, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is designed for problem partitioning and fast solving. As the result, the search space is efficiently narrowed down for each MPC step, and the computation speed is fast enough for real-time application. A simulation study shows that the developed controller can generate a fuel saving benefit of 14% for the tested scenarios."
1137924,21246,9475,Single timescale regularized stochastic approximation schemes for monotone Nash games under uncertainty,2010,"In this paper, we consider the distributed computation of equilibria arising in monotone stochastic Nash games over continuous strategy sets. Such games arise in settings when the gradient map of the player objectives is a monotone mapping over the cartesian product of strategy sets, leading to a monotone stochastic variational inequality. We consider the application of projection-based stochastic approximation (SA) schemes. However, such techniques are characterized by a key shortcoming: in their traditional form, they can only accommodate strongly monotone mappings. In fact, standard extensions of SA schemes for merely monotone mappings require the solution of a sequence of related strongly monotone problems, a natively two-timescale scheme. Accordingly, we consider the development of single timescale techniques for computing equilibria when the associated gradient map does not admit strong monotonicity. We first show that, under suitable assumptions, standard projection schemes can indeed be extended to allow for strict, rather than strong monotonicity. Furthermore, we introduce a class of regularized SA schemes, in which the regularization parameter is updated at every step, leading to a single timescale method. The scheme is a stochastic extension of an iterative Tikhonov regularization method and its global convergence is established. To aid in networked implementations, we consider an extension to this result where players are allowed to choose their steplengths independently and show the convergence of the scheme if the deviation across their choices is suitably constrained."
1310926,21246,9475,Mean field games with partially observed major player and stochastic mean field,2014,"Mean field game (MFG) theory where there is a major player and many minor players (MM-MFG) has been recently introduced in both the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) case and in the case of nonlinear state dynamics and nonlinear cost functions. In this framework, a major player has a significant influence, i.e., asymptotically non-vanishing, on any minor agent. In contrast to the situation without major agents, the mean field term now becomes stochastic due to the stochastic evolution of the state of the major player and, as a result, the best response control actions of the minor agents depend on the state of the major agent as well as the stochastic mean field. In a decentralized environment, one is led to consider the situation where the agents are provided only with partial information on the major agent's state and the mean field term. In this work, we consider such a scenario for systems with nonlinear dynamics and cost functions and develop MFG theory for a partially observed MM-MFG setup. More explicitly, we consider a MFG problem with (i) partial observations on the major player state provided to the minor agents individually and (ii) complete observations on that state provided to the major player. The first step of such a theory requires one to develop an estimation theory for partially observed stochastic dynamical systems whose state equations are of McKean-Vlasov (MV) type stochastic differential equations. The next approach to the problem for MM-MFG systems in this work is to follow the procedure of constructing the associated completely observed system via the application of nonlinear filtering theory. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria is then analyzed in this setting."
2448865,21246,9475,Distributed connectivity control of mobile networks,2007,"Control of mobile networks raises fundamental and novel problems in controlling the structure of the resulting dynamic graphs. In particular, in applications involving mobile sensor networks and multi-agent systems, a great new challenge is the development of distributed motion algorithms that guarantee connectivity of the overall network. In this paper, we address this challenge using a novel control decomposition. First, motion control is performed in the continuous state space, where nearest neighbor potential fields are used to maintain existing links in the network. Second, distributed coordination protocols in the discrete graph space ensure connectivity of the switching network topology. Coordination is based on locally updated estimates of the abstract network topology by every agent as well as distributed auctions that enable tie breaking whenever simultaneous link deletions may violate connectivity. Integration of the overall system results in a distributed, multi- agent, hybrid system for which we show that, under certain secondary objectives on the agents and the assumption that the initial network is connected, the resulting motion always satisfies connectivity of the network. Our approach can also account for communication time delays in the network as well as collision avoidance, while its efficiency and scalability properties are illustrated in nontrivial computer simulations."
976690,21246,9475,Dynamics in network games with local coordination and global congestion effects,2014,"Several strategic interactions over social networks display both negative and positive externalities at the same time. E.g., participation to a social media website with limited resources is more appealing the more of your friends participate, while a large total number of participants may slow down the website (because of congestion effects) thus making it less appealing. Similarly, while there are often incentives to choose the same telephone company as the friends and relatives with whom you interact the most frequently, concentration of the market share in the hands of a single firm typically leads to higher costs because of the lack of competition. In this work, we study evolutionary dynamics in network games where the payoff of each player is influenced both by the actions of her neighbors in the network, and by the aggregate of the actions of all the players in the network. In particular, we consider cases where the payoff increases in the number of neighbors who choose the same action (local coordination effect) and decreases in the total number of players choosing the same action (global congestion effect). We study noisy best-response dynamics in networks which are the union of two complete graphs, and prove that the asymptotic behavior of the invariant probability distribution is characterized by two phase transitions with respect to a parameter measuring the relative strength of the local coordination with respect to the global congestion effects. Extensions to random networks with strong community structure are studied through simulations."
2981601,21246,9475,Analysis farm: A cloud-based scalable aggregation and query platform for network log analysis,2011,"Network monitoring data provides insights into the network operation status. With increasingly sophisticated ways of probing, sampling and recording network activities, the huge amount of monitoring data brings both an opportunity and a challenge for network data analysis. We aim to build a scalable platform, named Analysis Farm, for analyzing network logs. Analysis Farm's targets include fast log aggregation and agile log query. To achieve these goals, storage scalability, computation scalability and query agility should be addressed. The cloud computing and NoSQL technologies meet our needs by providing manageable on-demand hardware resources and novel data storage models. We choose OpenStack, an open-source cloud tool set, for resource provisioning, and MongoDB, a RDBMS-like document-oriented NoSQL system, for log storage and analysis. By combining scalability at both OpenStack and MongoDB, we build Analysis Farm capable of storage scale-out, computation scale-out and agile query. The Analysis Farm prototype in use, consisting of 10 MongoDB servers, aggregates about 3 million log records in a 10-minute interval and handle ad hoc query effectively in the log database accumulated with more than 400 million records per day. In this paper, we describe Analysis Farm's background, targets, architecture and some experimental results. We believe Analysis Farm will benefit those who work on big-log-style data analysis."
1182682,21246,9475,Multivariable Multi-model-based magnetic control system for the current ramp-up phase in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX),2011,"By leveraging the availability of real time EFIT, we propose a robust, multi-model-based, multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) magnetic controller to provide current regulation, position stabilization, and shape control of the plasma during the current ramp-up phase in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). During the ramp-up phase of the tokamak discharge, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium continually evolves. As a consequence, the plasma response model obtained via linearization around the changing MHD equilibrium evolves as well. A robust controller is designed to stabilize this family of plasma models, which are reformulated into a nominal model with uncertainty. The proposed controller is composed of three loops: the first loop is devoted to plasma current regulation, the second loop is dedicated to plasma radial and vertical position stabilization, and the third loop is used to control the plasma shape and X-point location. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the nominal plasma model is carried out to decouple and identify the most relevant control channels. The DK-iteration method, combining H ∞  synthesis and μ analysis, is applied to synthesize a closed-loop controller that minimizes the tracking errors and optimizes input efforts. Computer simulations illustrate the performance of the robust, multi-model-based, shape controller, showing potential for improving the performance of present non-model-based controllers."
2930786,21246,9475,On Koopman and dynamic mode decompositions for application to dynamic data with low spatial dimension,2016,"Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has attracted a fair amount of attention in recent years. Applications of DMD have ranged from fluid mechanics, thermal dynamics in a building, power systems, and so on. Connections to the so-called Koopman operator have been highlighted, and variants of DMD have been called the Koopman Mode Decomposition (KMD). In many applications, these techniques are used as an attempt to derive a reduced-order system or to identify coherent dynamic structures characterized by modes oscillating with single frequencies. Therefore, they become highly relevant to control applications via the data-derived system modeling. However, in many utilizations other than within computational fluid dynamics, the spatial dimension, here defined as the number of measurement locations, of dynamic data becomes low, or even singular in the case of just one measurement sensor. Thus, the question arises on how well the different variants of DMD/KMD suggested in the literature work in this setting. In this paper, we apply three different DMD/KMD algorithms to experimental data and evaluate how well they identify modes in terms of their frequency, and show how the sampling frequency and temporal length of the data window affect the decompositions. We interpret the results with support from a new unified interpretation of the algorithms. It is shown that the so-called vector Prony analysis works well for a small spatial dimension, where standard DMD is not suitable."
2546769,21246,9475,Convex duality and entropy-based moment closures: Characterizing degenerate densities,2008,"A common method for constructing a function from a finite set of moments is to solve a constrained minimization problem. The idea is to find, among all functions with the given moments, that function which minimizes a physically motivated, strictly convex functional. In the kinetic theory of gases, this functional is the kinetic entropy; the given moments are macroscopic densities; and the solution to the constrained minimization problem is used to formally derive a closed system of partial differential equations which describe how the macroscopic densities evolve in time. Moment equations are useful because they simplify the kinetic, phase-space description of a gas, and with entropy-based closures, they retain many of the fundamental properties of kinetic transport. Unfortunately, in many situations, macroscopic densities can take on values for which the constrained minimization problem does not have a solution. In this paper, we give a geometric description of these so-called degenerate densities in a very general setting. Our key tool is the complementary slackness condition that is derived from a dual formulation of a minimization problem with relaxed constraints. We show that the set of degenerate densities is a union of convex cones defined by the complementary slackness conditions and, under reasonable assumptions, that this set is small in both a topological and a measure-theoretic sense. This result is important for further assessment and implementation of entropy-based moment closures. An expanded version of this work can be found in [Hauck et al., SIAM J. Contr. Optim., Vol. 47, 2008, pp. 1977-2015]."
1843811,21246,9475,Analyzing Local Field Potentials in the healthy basal ganglia under Deep Brain Stimulation,2010,"High frequency Deep Brain Stimulation in the Sub-Thalamic Nucleus is a clinically recognized therapy for the treatment of motor disorders in Parkinson's Disease. Sub-thalamic Nucleus (STN) is a small lens-shaped nucleus in the brain where it is a part of the basal ganglia system and is currently thought to play a prominent role in Parkinson's Disease (Obeso et al., 1997). STN is the typical stimulation target in patients with symptoms like tremor and motor skills, typical in Parkinson's disease. The underlying mechanisms of Deep Brain Stimulation and how it impacts neighboring nuclei, however, are not yet completely understood and this is the reason because Deep Brain Stimulation is still debated. Electrophysiological data has been collected in Parkinson's Disease patients and primates to better understand the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation(DBS) on Sub-thalamic Nucleus and the entire Basal Ganglia motor circuit. We use single unit recordings from Globus Pallidus, both pars interna and externa segments in Basal Ganglia (GPi and GPe respectively), in a normal primate before and after DBS to reconstruct Local Field Potentials in the region. The aim of this paper is to understand, via system identification techniques, how GPe activity and the DBS signal applied to Sub-thalamic Nucleus influence GPi activity (see Fig 1 and 2), in order to clarify the impact of DBS on Basal Ganglia nuclei (in particular on GPi) analyzing Local Field Potentials. Our models suggest that when no stimulation is applied, the GPe has an inhibitory effect on GPi with a 2 ms delay on Local Field Potentials (LFPs), as is the case for single unit neuronal activity (4-5 ms delay in this instance). On the other hand, when DBS is ON the models suggest that stimulation has a dominant effect on GPi LFPs which masks the inhibitory effects of GPe."
1498136,21246,9475,A fast method for solving guard set intersection in nonlinear hybrid reachability,2013,"Reachability computation formulates the problem of simulating the behavior of a continuous or hybrid dynamical system in a set-theoretical framework. Compared to the stochastic approach, it provides guaranteed results and has been shown highly valuable for verification or synthesis tasks. This issue is still quite challenging for uncertain nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems.Recently, [1] proposed a method for solving the flow/guard intersection problem that is at the core of hybrid reachability. It first derives an analytical expression for the boundaries of continuous flows using interval Taylor methods and techniques for controlling the wrapping effect. It then expresses the event detection and localization problem underlying flow/guard intersection as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP). One of the main issues in interval integration is to control, at each step, the overestimation of the reachable state set due to the wrapping effect. For this purpose, [1] only relies on the geometrical transformation induced by Lohner's QR-factorization method [4], which acts at the integration step. But when dealing with hybrid systems, another source of overestimation exists at the transition step. This paper describes an efficient method for solving flow/guard intersection: using the standard contractor HC4Revise at the transitions step, we will show how to minimize both the overestimation of the flow/guard intersection and the computational complexity, hence computation time. Interestingly, the geometrical transformation introduced by Lohner's QR-factorization method combined with our method, eventually minimizes the overestimation for the whole hybrid flow trajectory. The performance of the new method is illustrated on examples involving typical hybrid systems."
2663705,21246,9475,Optimal sensor transmission energy allocation for linear control over a packet dropping link with energy harvesting,2015,"This paper studies a closed loop linear control system. The sensor computes a state estimate and sends it to the controller/actuator in the receiver block over a randomly fading packet dropping link. The receiver sends an ACK/NACK packet to the transmitter over a link. It is assumed that the transmission energy per packet at the sensor depletes a battery of limited capacity, replenished by an energy harvester. The objective is to design an optimal energy allocation policy and an optimal control policy so that a finite horizon LQG control cost is minimized. It is shown that in case the receiver to sensor feedback channel is free of errors, a separation principle holds. Hence, the optimal LQG controller is linear, the Kalman filter is optimal and the optimal energy allocation policy is obtained via solving a backward dynamic programming equation. In case the feedback channel is erroneous, the separation principle does not hold. In this case, we propose a suboptimal policy where the controller still uses a linear control, and the transmitter minimizes an expected sum of the trace of an “estimated” receiver state estimation error covariance matrix. Simulations are used to illustrate the relative performance of the proposed algorithms and various heuristic algorithms for both the perfect and imperfect feedback cases. It is seen that the dynamic programming based policies outperform the simple heuristic policies by a margin."
2903733,21246,9475,A convex optimization approach to cancer treatment to address tumor heterogeneity and imperfect drug penetration in physiological compartments,2016,"The clinical success of targeted cancer therapies is limited by the emergence of drug resistance often due to pre-existing tumor genetic heterogeneity and acquired, therapy-induced resistance. Targeted therapies have varied success in addressing metastatic disease, due to their ability to penetrate certain physiological compartments. This paper considers an evolutionary cancer model that incorporates tumor cell growth, mutation and compartmental migration and leverages recent results on the optimal control of monotone and convex systems to synthesize switching treatment strategies where a single drug or a predetermined combination of drugs is used at a given time. The need for switching is motivated by clinical considerations such as the limited effectiveness of any single targeted therapy against multiple resistance mechanisms arising in a single patient and the inability to design drug combinations at effective doses due to toxicity constraints. An optimal and clinically feasible switching therapy is obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem that exploits the diagonally-dominant structure of the model. We demonstrate that this method yields an effective strategy in mitigating disease evolution in the presence of imperfect drug penetration in two compartments on an experimentally identified model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung carcinoma."
2968976,21246,9475,Decentralized event-triggered medium access control for networked control systems,2016,"In practice often multiple control applications share a communication channel, requiring a smart and scalable scheduling mechanism to coordinate the access to the capacity-limited communication medium. In this paper, we propose a decentralized event-triggered medium access control (MAC) for multiple feedback control loops which are coupled through a capacity-limited communication medium. The individual control loops are assumed to be linear time-invariant (LTI) with stochastic heterogeneous plants. Noisy state measurements from local sensors are transmitted through a shared communication medium to their respective control units. Due to capacity limitations in the shared communication channel, not all sensors are allowed to transmit simultaneously. To allocate the scarce resources, a decentralized MAC which prioritizes the channel access according to a real-time error-dependent measure, is introduced. The prioritization is orchestrated via a combined deterministic and probabilistic mechanism aiming at the efficient allocation of the limited capacity. We study stability of the described multi-loop NCS under the proposed MAC design in terms of Lyapunov stability in probability (LSP). It is demonstrated that the collision rate remains low by properly tuning the MAC parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed MAC design significantly outperforms conventional time-triggered and random access schemes, while its performance closely follows the centralized TOD approach."
2377933,21246,9475,Cauchy estimation for linear scalar systems,2008,"An estimation paradigm is presented for scalar discrete linear systems entailing additive process and measurement noises that have Cauchy probability density functions (pdf). For systems with Gaussian noises, the Kalman filter has been the main estimation paradigm. However, many practical system uncertainties that have impulsive character, such as radar glint, are better described by stable non-Gaussian densities, for example, the Cauchy pdf. Although the Cauchy pdf does not have a well defined mean and does have an infinite second moment, the conditional density of a Cauchy random variable, given its linear measurements with an additive Cauchy noise, has a conditional mean and a finite conditional variance, both being functions of the measurement. For a single measurement, simple expressions are obtained for the conditional mean and variance, by deriving closed form expressions for the infinite integrals associated with the minimum variance estimation problem. To alleviate the complexity of the multi-stage estimator, the conditional pdf is represented in a special factored form. A recursion scheme is then developed based on this factored form and closed form integrations, allowing for the propagation of the conditional mean and variance over an arbitrary number of time stages. In simulations, the performance of the newly developed scalar discrete-time Cauchy estimator is significantly superior to a Kalman filter in the presence of Cauchy noise, whereas the Cauchy estimator deteriorates only slightly compared to the Kalman filter in the presence of Gaussian noise. Remarkably, this new recursive Cauchy conditional mean estimator has parameters that are generated by linear difference equations with stochastic coefficients, providing computational efficiency."
2631791,21246,9475,Towards provably safe mixed transportation systems with human-driven and automated vehicles,2015,"Currently we are in an environment where the fraction of automated vehicles is negligibly small. We anticipate that this fraction will increase in the coming decades before, if ever, we have a fully automated transportation system. Motivated by this we address the problem of provable safety of mixed traffic consisting of both intelligent vehicles (IVs) as well as human driven vehicles (HVs). An important issue that arises is that such mixed systems may well have lesser throughput than all-human traffic systems, if the automated vehicles are expected to remain provably safe with respect to human traffic. This necessitates the consideration of strategies such as platooning of automated vehicles in order to increase the throughput. In this paper we address the design of provably safe systems consisting of a mix of automated and human-driven vehicles including the use of platooning by automated vehicles. We design motion planning policies and coordination rules for participants in this novel mixed system. HVs are considered as nearsighted and modeled with relatively loose constraints, while IVs are considered as capable of following much tighter constraints. HVs are expected to follow reasonable and simple rules. IVs are designed to move under a model predictive control (MPC) based motion plans and coordination protocols. Our contribution in this paper is in showing how to integrate these two types of models safely into a mixed system. System safety is proved in single lane scenarios, as well as in multi-lane situations allowing lane changes."
1533753,21246,9475,Safe and efficient operation of centrifugal compressors using linearized MPC,2014,"Centrifugal compressors are widely used in many industrial applications such as natural gas extraction, refrigeration and gas transport. Since gas compression is both an energy and capital intensive process, it is very important to operate gas compressors in a safe and efficient manner in order to save resources and utilize their maximum capacity. This typically means to operate gas compression systems at working points that are close to surge, an unstable condition that can cause severe damage to the compressor and the associated piping system. Anti-surge control systems aim at preventing the compressor from going into surge due to planned operating condition changes and also due to unexpected external disturbances which can affect the system within a time window of hundreds of milliseconds. Anti-surge control is achieved by recycling or venting-off some of the compressed gas in order to increase the mass flow through the compressor and reduce the pressure ratio. Recently, also the use of electrical drives powering the compressor for enhancing surge avoidance has been proposed. Generally, anti-surge control can be stated as a nonlinear multivariable control problem with output constraints that also present very fast dynamics. In this paper, the potential benefits of an anti-surge controller based on linearized model predictive control (MPC) are discussed. The employed MPC algorithm has been implemented on an industrial controller to meet the real-time requirements and has been tested on a experimental compressor test rig. The control performance of a linearized MPC-based anti-surge controller is compared to that of a traditional anti-surge control approach with controlled discharge pressure and controlled distance to surge in the case of external disturbances."
1921214,21246,9475,Search decisions for teams of automata,2008,"The dynamics of exploration vs exploitation decisions are explored in the context of robotic search problems. Building on prior work on robotic search together with our own work on reactive control laws for potential field mapping, we propose a new set of search protocols for teams of sensor-enabled mobile robots. The focus is on collaborative strategies for the search of potential fields that are possibly time varying. We pose the problem of quickly finding regions where the potential achieves or exceeds a certain threshold. The search protocol has two distinct components. In an ?exploration phase?, agents execute either a randomized or structured search, seeking places where the field achieves or exceeds the prescribed threshold. Once a threshold point is reached, the ?exploitation? component is initialized and the agents deploy so as to rapidly map the evolving isoline associated with the given value of the field. Conservative strategies will emphasize refining the detailed knowledge of the field in a small neighborhood of the isoline, while aggressive strategies will emphasize wide-ranging exploration of neighboring territory. The main decision problem under study involves finding the optimally aggressive exploration strategy. Additionally, the problem of the allocation of the agents between ?exploration? and ?exploitation? is considered. A performance metric is developed to compare the proposed methods with standard approaches such as random search and distributed raster scans."
2842115,21246,9475,Understanding robust control theory via stick balancing,2016,"Robust control theory studies the effect of noise, disturbances, and other uncertainty on system performance. Despite growing recognition across science and engineering that robustness and efficiency tradeoffs dominate the evolution and design of complex systems, the use of robust control theory remains limited, partly because the mathematics involved is relatively inaccessible to nonexperts, and the important concepts have been inexplicable without a fairly rich mathematics background. This paper aims to begin changing that by presenting the most essential concepts in robust control using human stick balancing, a simple case study popular in both the sensorimotor control literature and extremely familiar to engineers. With minimal and familiar models and mathematics, we can explore the impact of unstable poles and zeros, delays, and noise, which can then be easily verified with simple experiments using a standard extensible pointer. Despite its simplicity, this case study has extremes of robustness and fragility that are initially counter-intuitive but for which simple mathematics and experiments are clear and compelling. The theory used here has been well-known for many decades, and the cart-pendulum example is a standard in undergrad controls courses, yet a careful reconsidering of both leads to striking new insights that we argue are of great pedagogical value."
1863760,21246,9475,Parameter identification for the shallow water equation using modal decomposition,2007,"A parameter identification problem for systems governed by first-order, linear hyperbolic partial differential equations subjected to periodic forcing is investigated. The problem is posed as a PDE constrained optimization problem with data of the problem given by the measured input and output variables at the boundary of the domain. By using the governing equations in the frequency domain, a spatially dependent transfer matrix relating the input variables to the output variables is obtained. It is shown that by considering a finite number of dominant oscillatory modes of the input, an accurate representation of the output can be obtained. This converts the original PDE constrained optimization problem to one without any constraints. The optimal parameters can be identified using standard nonlinear programming. The utility of the proposed approach is illustrated by considering a river reach in the Sacramento-San-Joaquin Delta, California, that is subjected to tidal forcing. The dynamics of the reach are modeled by linearized Saint-Venant equations. The available data is the flow variables measured upstream and downstream of the reach. The parameter identification problem is to estimate the average free-surface width, the bed slope, the friction coefficient and the steady-state boundary conditions. It is shown that the estimated model gives an accurate prediction of the flow variables at an intermediate location within the reach."
1326829,21246,9475,Dynamic coupling between a human user and haptic virtual environment,2012,"In a teaching lab focused on embedded control, students create and interact with virtual environments using a haptic interface. Coupling physical (in particular physiological) environments to virtual environments gives rise to many interesting phenomena, one of which is the appearance of dissipativity in the coupled dynamics, the source of which is difficult to identify. Simple harmonic oscillators without damping exhibit damped behavior and diminished peak amplitudes when students excite them with their best manual approximations of step inputs. Motivated in part by our desire to develop teaching materials, we seek a simple human user model that describes the observed phenomena. We have found that a second order spring-mass-damper model describes the source impedance with which a human user is able to impose a position input on the haptic device, and that this impedance model can be incorporated into a model of the user's neuromotor intent by placing the spring as a series elastic element with a motion source. We use simple models to describe smooth inputs generated by the user's neuromotor system, and these are expressed as displacements of the motion source. We use the same haptic device to conduct system identification experiments using frequency domain techniques to estimate the driving point impedance of the human hand, and have recently incorporated these experiments into lab exercises."
1214319,21246,9475,Evaluation of the performance of indirect control of many DSRs using hardware-in-the-loop simulations,2012,"Controlling the power consumption of many Demand Side Resources, DSRs, will be required in the future power system where a big share of the electric energy will be produced using stochastic renewable sources and the conventional power plants might not have the flexibility of providing all the regulating power. Indirect control of demand side resources is supposed to shift the electric power consumption of each single unit through broadcasting of a control signal; the flexibility in the aggregated power consumption can be used for supplying balancing power to the electric power system. Indirect control approach is convenient from communication point of view since the real-time data flow is only in one direction because the decision is computed locally according to user preferences. On the other hand, this approach results in an open loop control scheme, since it is assumed that no real-time power readings from the units can be performed. The aim of the paper is to discuss the performance of an emulated closed loop control using an estimator for predicting the aggregate power response and a regulator. By using these components it is possible to produce a control signal to broadcast to distributed demand side resources. A population of DSRs, buildings with electric space heating, is indeed simulated in a software simulation platform using an hardware in the loop approach, that allows to feedback the real heat dynamics of SYSLAB FlexHouse into the simulations for pretending more realistic result."
1781162,21246,23735,Optimal LQG Control and Stability of Networked Robot System with Data Dropout,2006,"By modeling the networked robot system (NRS) that drops packets randomly, we considered the problem of optimal linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control and analyzed the stability of a NRS. We presented a mathematical model based on a packet-based setting, extended the familiar LQG separation principle that allows us to solve this problem using a standard LQR state-feedback design, proposed an optimal algorithm irrespective of the packet drop pattern by constructing an encoder for the unreliable channel and designing the decoder that uses the information it receives across the link to construct an estimate of the state of the networked robot. For the case of packet drops occurring according to a Markov chain, the stability analysis was carried out. Because the separation theorem for linear systems and quadratic cost does not apply to the general framework of NRSs, we used the uncertainty threshold principle to show that under certain conditions there was a rate for dropped packets for which an undisturbed networked control system with imperfect state observation was mean square stable, used a sub-optimal method to simplify the calculation of the estimator and controller, got the solution to the Riccati-like equation and guaranteed the mean square stability of the NRS with perfect state information. This design does not assume any statistical model of the packet drop events and can be implemented as a small modification of an existing LQG control design."
746807,21246,9475,Stability margins in adaptive mixing control via a Lyapunov-based switching criterion,2012,"This paper proposes a Lyapunov-based switching logic within the framework of adaptive mixing control (AMC), where a weighted combination of a family of candidate controllers can be inserted in the loop to regulate the output of an uncertain plant. The proposed AMC scheme employs a bank of parallel estimators, or multiple estimators, together with a switching logic that orchestrates which estimate should be evaluated by the mixer. The switching logic is driven by input/output data and uses Lyapunov-based criteria to assess the best estimate among the bank of parallel estimates. The resulting scheme guarantees convergence of the switching signal in finite time to a controller that satisfies a Lyapunov inequality implying a prescribed stability margin. The problem of convergence to the desired controller is addressed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, most classes of continuous tuning adaptive control or switching adaptive control schemes do not guarantee that after the switching stops or the adaptation is switched off the resulting closed loop linear time-invariant (LTI) system is stable, unless there is sufficient plant excitation that guarantees convergence to the desired fixed parameter controller. The proposed scheme guarantees that if the desired controller is switched on, it will never be switched off thereafter. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate that while alternative adaptation methods can converge to an LTI unstable feedback loop, the proposed scheme consistently converges to the desired controller."
1474435,21246,9475,Optimal control of manifold filling during VDE mode transitions,2013,"During mode transitions in advanced engines and powertrains, actuators (electronic throttle, fuel, spark timing, variable valve timing, etc.) need to be optimally coordinated to obtain the correct state for the next mode. Specific examples of mode changes include cylinder deactivation/reactivation transitions in variable displacement engines, combustion mode transitions in HCCI and DISI engines and clutch transitions between locked and unlocked states in dual clutch transmissions. Mode transitions lead naturally to optimal control problems that can be analyzed using the maximum principle and solved numerically. From this perspective, the paper considers in detail one of the simplest problems of its kind (which to the authors' knowledge has not been treated), the optimal control of intake manifold filling using the electronic throttle. This problem is relevant to variable displacement engines and to the fuel economy that these engines can achieve. The analysis of minimum time and Nonlinear Quadratic (NLQ) optimal control problems is presented for the nonlinear manifold filling dynamics based on the maximum principle and simulated optimal trajectories are reported. Then a recently proposed Iterative Model and Trajectory Refinement (IMTR) strategy for solving trajectory optimization problems is validated using the intake manifold pressure filling as a case study. Specifically, we demonstrate the convergence of IMTR to trajectories that are close enough to the trajectories obtained from the maximum principle."
815385,21246,20649,Optimal control of PEVs for energy cost minimization and frequency regulation in the smart grid accounting for battery state-of-health degradation,2015,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are considered the key to reducing the fossil fuel consumption and an important part of the smart grid. The plug-in electric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology in the smart grid infrastructure enables energy flow from PEV batteries to the power grid so that the grid stability is enhanced and the peak power demand is shaped. PEV owners will also benefit from V2G technology as they will be able to reduce energy cost through proper PEV charging and discharging scheduling. Moreover, power regulation service (RS) reserves have been playing an increasingly important role in modern power markets. It has been shown that by providing RS reserves, the power grid achieves a better match between energy supply and demand in presence of volatile and intermittent renewable energy generation. This paper addresses the problem of PEV charging under dynamic energy pricing, properly taking into account the degradation of battery state-of-health (SoH) during V2G operations as well as RS provisioning. An overall optimization throughout the whole parking period is proposed for the PEV and an adaptive control framework is presented to dynamically update the optimal charging/discharging decision at each time slot to mitigate the effect of RS tracking error. Experimental results show that the proposed optimal PEV charging algorithm minimizes the combination of electricity cost and battery aging cost in the RS provisioning power market."
2106759,21246,9475,Modeling and optimizing military air operations,2009,"Dynamic programming has recently received significant attention as a possible technology for formulating control commands for decision makers in an extended complex enterprise that involves adversarial behavior. Enterprises of this type are typically modeled by a nonlinear discrete time dynamic system. The state is controlled by two decision makers, each with a different objective function and different hierarchy of decision making structure. To illustrate this enterprise, we derive a state space dynamic model of an extended complex military operation that involves two opposing forces engaged in a battle. The model assumes a number of fixed targets that one force is attacking and the other is defending. Due to the number of control commands, options for each force, and the steps during which the two forces could be engaged, the optimal solution for such a complicated dynamic game over all stages is computationally extremely difficult, if not impossible, to propose. As an alternative, we propose an expeditious suboptimal solution for this type of adversarial engagement. We discuss a solution approach where the decisions are decomposed hierarchically and the task allocation is separate from cooperation decisions. This decoupled solution, although suboptimal in the global sense, is useful in taking into account how fast the decisions should be in the presence of adversaries. An example scenario illustrating this military model and our solution approach is presented."
1242184,21246,9475,Unidirectional direct load control through smart plugs,2014,"Balancing energy demand and production is becoming a more and more challenging task for energy utilities also because of the larger penetration of renewable energies which are more difficult to predict and control. While the traditional solution is to dynamically adapt energy production to follow time-varying demand, a new trend is to drive demand itself. Most of the ongoing actions in this direction involve greedy energy consumers, like industrial plants, supermarkets or large buildings. Pervasive communication technologies may allow in the near future to push further the granularity of such approach, by having the energy utility interacting with residential appliances. In this paper we study large scale direct control of inelastic home appliances whose energy demand cannot be shaped, but simply deferred. Our solution does not suppose any particular intelligence at the appliances. The actuators are rather smart plugs—simple devices with local communication capabilities that can be inserted between appliances' plugs and power sockets and are able to interrupt/reactivate power flow through the plug. A simple control message can be broadcast to a large set of smart plugs for probabilistically enabling or deferring the activation requests of a specific load type in order to satisfy a probabilistic bound on the aggregated power consumption. The control law can be easily derived analytically."
2385733,21246,9475,Advances in moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems,2010,"In the last decade, moving horizon estimation (MHE) has emerged as a powerful technique for tackling the problem of estimating the state of a dynamic system in the presence of nonlinearities and disturbances. MHE is based on the idea of minimizing an estimation cost function defined on a sliding window composed of a finite number of time stages. The cost function is usually made up of two contributions: a prediction error computed on a recent batch of inputs and outputs; an arrival cost that serves the purpose of summarizing the past data. However, the diffusion of such techniques has been hampered by: i) the difficulty in choosing the arrival cost so as to ensure stability of the overall estimation scheme; ii) the request of an adequate computational effort on line. In this paper, both problems are addressed and possible solutions are proposed. First, by means of a novel stability analysis, it is constructively shown that under very general observability conditions a quadratic arrival cost is sufficient to ensure the stability of the estimation error provided that the weight matrix is adequately chosen. Second, a novel approximate MHE algorithm is proposed that is based on nonlinear programming sensitivity calculations. The approximate MHE algorithm has the same stability properties of the optimal one which make the overall approach suitable to be applied in real settings. Preliminary simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed method."
2524645,21246,9475,Neural network based sensor validation scheme demonstrated on an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) model,2008,"Nowadays model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) systems have become a crucial step towards autonomy in aerospace engineering. However few publications consider FDI applications to unmanned air vehicles (UAV) where full-autonomy is obligatory. In this paper we demonstrate a sensor fault detection and accommodation (SFDA) system, which makes use of analytical redundancy between flight parameters, on a UAV model. A Radial-Basis Function (RBF) neural network (NN) trained online with Extended Minimum Resource Allocating Network (EMRAN) algorithms is chosen for modelling purposes due to its ability to adapt well to nonlinear environments while maintaining high computational speeds. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce false alarms (FA) and missed faults (MF) in current SFDA systems, we introduce a novel residual generator. After 47 minutes (CPU running time) of NN offline training, the SFDA scheme is able to detect additive and constant bias sensor faults with zero FA and MF. It also shows good global approximation capabilities, essential for fault accommodation, with an average pitch gyro estimation error of 0.0075 rad/s."
586584,21246,9475,Optimal control of the state statistics for a linear stochastic system,2015,"We consider a variant of the classical linear quadratic Gaussian regulator (LQG) in which penalties on the endpoint state are replaced by the specification of the terminal state distribution. The resulting theory considerably differs from LQG as well as from formulations that bound the probability of violating state constraints. We develop results for optimal state-feedback control in the two cases where i) steering of the state distribution is to take place over a finite window of time with minimum energy, and ii) the goal is to maintain the state at a stationary distribution over an infinite horizon with minimum power. For both problems the distribution of noise and state are Gaussian. In the first case, we show that provided the system is controllable, the state can be steered to any terminal Gaussian distribution over any specified finite time-interval. In the second case, we characterize explicitly the covariance of admissible stationary state distributions that can be maintained with constant state-feedback control. The conditions for optimality are expressed in terms of a system of dynamically coupled Riccati equations in the finite horizon case and in terms of algebraic conditions for the stationary case. In the case where the noise and control share identical input channels, the Riccati equations for finite-horizon steering become homogeneous and can be solved in closed form. The present paper is largely based on our recent work in [1], [2] and presents an overview of certain key results."
2711539,21246,9475,Integrated analysis of multiple high-dimensional data sets by joint rank-1 matrix approximations,2015,"In this work, we developed an algorithm for the integrated analysis of multiple high-dimensional data matrices based on sparse rank-one matrix approximations. The algorithm approximates multiple data matrices with rank one outer products composed of sparse left singular-vectors that are unique to each matrix and a right singular-vector that is shared by all of the data matrices. The right-singular vector represents a signal we wish to detect in the row-space of each matrix. The non-zero components of the resulting left-singular vectors identify rows of each matrix that in aggregate provide a sparse linear representation of the shared right-singular vector. This sparse representation facilitates downstream interpretation and validation of the resulting model based on the rows selected from each matrix. False discovery rate is used to select an appropriate l1 penalty parameter that imposes sparsity on the left singular-vector but not the common right singular-vector of the joint approximation. Since a given multi-modal data set (MMDS) may contain multiple signals of interest the algorithm is iteratively applied to the residualized version of original data to sequentially capture and model each distinct signal in terms of rows from the different matrices. We show that the algorithm outperforms standard singular value decomposition over a wide range of simulation scenarios in terms of detection accuracy. Analysis of real data for ovarian and liver cancer resulted in compact gene expression signatures that were predictive of clinical outcomes and highly enriched for cancer related biology."
2034710,21246,9475,Quotient method for controlling the acrobot,2009,"This paper describes a two-sweep control design method to stabilize the acrobot, an input-affine under-actuated system, at the upper equilibrium point. In the forward sweep, the system is successively reduced, one dimension at a time, until a two-dimensional system is obtained. At each step of the reduction process, a quotient is taken along one-dimensional integral manifolds of the input vector field. This decomposes the current manifold into classes of equivalence that constitute a quotient manifold of reduced dimension. The input to a given step becomes the representative of the previous-step equivalence class, and a new input vector field can be defined on the tangent of the quotient manifold. The representatives remain undefined throughout the forward sweep. During the backward sweep, the controller is designed recursively, starting with the two-dimensional system. At each step of the recursion, a well-chosen representative of the equivalence class ahead of the current level of recursion is chosen, so as to guarantee stability of the current step. Therefore, this stabilizes the global system once the backward sweep is complete. Although stability can only be guaranteed locally around the upper equilibrium point, the domain of attraction can be enlarged to include the lower-equilibrium point, thereby allowing a swing-up implementation. As a result, the controller does not require switching, which is illustrated in simulation. The controller has four tuning parameters, which helps shape the closed-loop behavior."
1413876,21246,9475,A two-time-scale model-based combined magnetic and kinetic control system for advanced tokamak scenarios on DIII-D,2012,"System identification techniques have been successfully used to obtain linear dynamic plasma response models around a particular equilibrium in different tokamaks. This paper identifies a two-time-scale dynamic model of the rotational transform ι profile and β N  in response to the electric field due to induction as well as to heating and current drive (H&CD) systems based on experimental data from DIII-D. The control goal is to regulate the plasma ι profile and β N  around a particular target value. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the plasma model at steady state is carried out to decouple the system and identify the most relevant control channels. A mixed sensitivity H ∞  control design problem is solved to determine a stabilizing feedback controller that minimizes the reference tracking error and rejects external disturbances with minimal control energy. The feedback controller is augmented with an anti-windup compensator, which keeps the given controller well-behaved in the presence of magnitude constraints in the actuators and leaves the nominal closed-loop unmodified when no saturation is present. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed controller, which is one of the first profile controllers integrating magnetic and kinetic variables ever implemented in DIII-D."
1783415,21246,9475,Optimal policies for control of peers in online multimedia services,2007,"In this paper we consider a distributed peer-based system with a centralized controller responsible for managing the peers. For this system customers request large volumes of information such as video clips which instead of retrieving from a centralized repository of a parent organization are obtained from peers that possess the clips. Peers act as servers only for a short duration and therefore the parent organization (i.e. centralized controller) would need to add new peer servers from time to time. This centralized admission control of deciding whether or not to admit a customer with a video clip as a peer based on the system state (number of waiting requests and number of existing peers) is the crux of this research. The problem can be posed as a discrete stochastic optimal control and is formulated using a Markov decision process approach with infinite horizon and discounted cost/reward. We show that a stationary threshold policy in terms of the state of the system is optimal. In other words the optimal decision whether or not to accept a customer as a peer server is characterized by a switching curve. In typical Markov decision processes, it is extremely difficult to derive an analytical expression for the switching curve. However, using an asymptotic analysis, by suitably scaling time and states taking fluid limits, we show how this can be done for our problem. In addition, the asymptotic analysis can also be used to show that the switching curve is independent of the model parameters such as customer arrival rate, downloading times and peer-server lifetimes. Several numerical results are presented to support the analytical claims based on asymptotic analysis."
1327450,21246,9475,Optimizing robust limit cycles for legged locomotion on unknown terrain,2012,"While legged animals are adept at traversing rough landscapes, it remains a very challenging task for a legged robot to negotiate unknown terrain. Control systems for legged robots are plagued by dynamic constraints from underactuation, actuator power limits, and frictional ground contact; rather than relying purely on disturbance rejection, considerable advantage can be obtained by planning nominal trajectories which are more easily stabilized. In this paper, we present an approach for designing nominal periodic trajectories for legged robots that maximize a measure of robustness against uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) on unknown terrain. Moreover, we demonstrate that it generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle optimized for efficiency only."
1209477,21246,9475,A weighted least-squares method for parameter estimation in structured models,2014,"Parameter estimation in structured models is generally considered a difficult problem. For example, the prediction error method (PEM) typically gives a non-convex optimization problem, while it is difficult to incorporate structural information in subspace identification. In this contribution, we revisit the idea of iteratively using the weighted least-squares method to cope with the problem of non-convex optimization. The method is, essentially, a three-step method. First, a high order least-squares estimate is computed. Next, this model is reduced to a structured estimate using the least-squares method. Finally, the structured estimate is re-estimated, using weighted least-squares, with weights obtained from the first structured estimate. This methodology has a long history, and has been applied to a range of signal processing problems. In particular, it forms the basis of iterative quadratic maximum likelihood (IQML) and the Steiglitz-McBride method. Our contributions are as follows. Firstly, for output-error models, we provide statistically optimal weights. We conjecture that the method is asymptotically efficient under mild assumptions and support this claim by simulations. Secondly, we point to a wide range of structured estimation problems where this technique can be applied. Finally, we relate this type of technique to classical prediction error and subspace methods by showing that it can be interpreted as a link between the two, sharing favorable properties with both domains."
2642706,21246,9475,A convex approach to sparse ℋ∞ analysis & synthesis,2015,"In this paper, we propose a new robust analysis tool motivated by large-scale systems. The ℋ∞ norm of a system measures its robustness by quantifying the worst-case behavior of a system perturbed by a unit-energy disturbance. However, the disturbance that induces such worst-case behavior requires perfect coordination among all disturbance channels. Given that many systems of interest, such as the power grid, the internet and automated vehicle platoons, are large-scale and spatially distributed, such coordination may not be possible, and hence the ℋ∞ norm, used as a measure of robustness, may be too conservative. We therefore propose a cardinality constrained variant of the ℋ∞ norm in which an adversarial disturbance can use only a limited number of channels. As this problem is inherently combinatorial, we present a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation based on the l1 norm that yields an upper bound on the cardinality constrained robustness problem. We further propose a simple rounding heuristic based on the optimal solution of our SDP relaxation, which provides a corresponding lower bound. Motivated by privacy in large-scale systems, we also extend these relaxations to computing the minimum gain of a system subject to a limited number of inputs. Finally, we also present a SDP based optimal controller synthesis method for minimizing the SDP relaxation of our novel robustness measure. The effectiveness of our semidefinite relaxation is demonstrated through numerical examples."
995619,21246,9475,Synchronization of a budding yeast cell culture by manipulating inner cell cycle concentrations,2012,"The synchronization of cell populations is an important topic not only in research but also for biotechnological production processes. Synchronization means that all cells in the culture are in the same phase of the cell cycle and that they divide, at best, in unison. A synchronized cell culture is an important topic in molecular biology to analyze cell cycle events and to understand how the cells control growth and division. It has a high potential in biotechnological production processes because many products which are of commercial interest are cell cycle dependent or are synthesized in a cell cycle dependent manner. In this work a strategy for the synchronization of an in silico budding yeast cell culture is computed and analyzed. The in silico culture is based on a single cell cycle model taken from the literature which describes the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the concentrations and interactions of proteins that participate in the cell cycle. By individually setting the parameters for each cell, the model can be used to model a non-homogenous cell population. The synchronization approach followed here is based on the manipulation of the concentrations of native proteins. The variation of two parameters in the model that can be achieved by different gene expression rates leads to a modified expression of two cyclins that appear in the late G 1  phase. Dependent on the concentration of these two cyclins, the G 1  phase can be either lengthened or shortened, thus maintaining the cells in the G 1  phase or accelerating their transition to the other phases. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, the optimization is done by a memetic algorithm. The synchronization is applied to an exponential growing cell population inside a batch reactor and a chemostat. A detailed analysis of the effect of the expression levels is presented. For the chemostat, a periodic pattern for synchronizing and keeping the culture in synchrony is computed."
1720477,21246,9475,Control and sensitivity reduction for a viscous Burgers' equation,2012,"The problem of designing and numerically implementing a controller for a fluid flow system at the boundary of the flow domain is complicated by the facts that the basic model is truly nonlinear and the flow is usually highly sensitive to boundary conditions. High sensitivity to small changes in the boundary such as wall roughness or dynamic excitations can trigger transition to undesirable states. One approach to preventing or delaying a transition is to introduce a simple control loop along the boundary to reduce the sensitivity. In this work we demonstrate the aforementioned idea for a system governed by the one dimensional Burgers' equation. In particular, we focus on the initial boundary value problem for a viscous Burgers' equation which is known to be is extremely sensitive with respect to a small perturbation in a Neumann boundary condition. We use this model to illustrate how this sensitivity can generate erroneous numerical solutions and “transitions” to these states. In particular, for a fixed viscosity and certain initial data the numerical solution z(x; t) of Burgers' equation with a Neumann boundary condition z x (0; t) = 0 converges to a (large) solution that satisfies z x (0; t) = −α for a number α > 0 less than machine precision zero. Thus, the solution of the Burgers' equations for this problem exhibits an extreme sensitivity to the boundary perturbation α and this sensitivity can produce unexpected and undesired dynamic behavior. We use a continuous sensitivity equation method to compute these sensitivities and show that the sensitivity can be eliminated by introducing a very simple proportional error boundary feedback mechanism."
2088749,21246,9475,On the analysis of noise in gene regulatory networks,2007,"Life processes in single cells and at the molecular level are inherently stochastic. Quantifying the noise is, however, far from trivial, as a major contribution comes from intrinsic fluctuations, arising from the randomness in the times between discrete jumps. It is discussed in the paper how an operator theoretic interpretation can be relevant for analyzing the intrinsic stochasticity in jump processes described by master equations. Such interpretation naturally exists in linear noise approximations, but it also provides an exact description of the jump process when the transition rates are linear. As an important example, it is shown in the paper how by addressing the proximity of the underlying dynamics in an appropriate topology, a sequence of coupled birth death processes, which can be relevant in gene expression, tends to a pure delay, thus implying important limitations in noise suppression capabilities. We finally consider the effects of noise in the case of nonlinear macroscopic models leading to bistabilities. It is discussed that bistability in the deterministic mass action kinetics and bimodality in the steady state solution of the master equation, neither always imply one another, nor do they necessarily lead to efficient switching behaviours: the underlying dynamics need to be taken into account in a correct context."
1852523,21246,9475,LPV model order selection in an LS-SVM setting,2013,"In parametric identification of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems, the scheduling dependencies of the model coefficients are commonly parameterized in terms of linear combinations of a-priori selected basis functions. Such functions need to be adequately chosen, e.g., on the basis of some first-principles or expert's knowledge of the system, in order to capture the unknown dependencies of the model coefficient functions on the scheduling variable and, at the same time, to achieve a low-variance of the model estimate by limiting the number of parameters to be identified. This problem together with the well-known model order selection problem (in terms of number of input lags, output lags and input delay of the model structure) in system identification can be interpreted as a trade-off between bias and variance of the resulting model estimate. The problem of basis function selection can be avoided by using a non-parametric estimator of the coefficient functions in terms of a recently proposed Least-Square Support-Vector-Machine (LS-SVM) approach. However, the selection of the model order still appears to be an open problem in the identification of LPV systems via the LS-SVM method. In this paper, we propose a novel reformulation of the LPV LS-SVM approach, which, besides of the non-parametric estimation of the coefficient functions, achieves data-driven model order selection via convex optimization. The properties of the introduced approach are illustrated via a simulation example."
910093,21246,9475,A predictor-corrector approach for multi-rate sampled-data control of spatially distributed systems,2012,"This work presents a methodology for the design of model-based output feedback controllers for spatially distributed systems modeled by highly-dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) with multiple measured outputs that are sampled at different sampling rates. Initially, an approximate finite-dimensional system that captures the dominant dynamics of the infinite-dimensional system is obtained and used to design an observer-based output feedback controller. Due to the lack of continuous measurements, an inter-sample model predictor is included in the controller and used to provide the observer with estimates of the unavailable outputs. The model predictions are then updated and corrected at each time that a measurement becomes available. Owing to the different sampling rates of the available measurement sensors, the model update is performed using different outputs, or combinations of outputs, at each update time. A hybrid system formulation that captures the model update pattern is used to analyze the stability properties of the sampled-data finite-dimensional closed-loop system and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for closed-loop stability. The condition is used to explicitly characterize the interdependence between the different sampling rates, the size of the model uncertainty, the controller and observer design parameters, and the spatial locations of the control actuators and measurement sensors. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using a diffusion-reaction process example."
1129848,21246,9475,Two loop based dynamical feedback stabilization control of a diesel engine with EGR & VGT,2011,"In this paper, a fourth-order dimensional nonlinear model is proposed for a diesel engine equipped with a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) and an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve. The referred model which takes into account the engine crankshaft speed dynamics and the air-path dynamics is a non-minimum phase unstable system. The fuel flow rate W ƒ  which is considered as input for the engine crankshaft subsystem acts as an external perturbation for the three-order dimensional non-minimum phase air-path subsystem. The global control objectives are to track desired values of engine speed, intake manifold pressure and compressor flow mass rate which can be suitably chosen according to low emission criterions. For the considered objectives two loop based dynamical feedback stabilization control is proposed: an inner loop and an outer loop. The inner loop considers a control based on Lyapunov function which realizes the desired engine speed trajectory tracking. The outer loop concerns EGR & VGT control. It is developed from a particular extended nonlinear air-path subsystem with its modified outputs. This outer loop ensures both the desired intake manifold pressure and the desired compressor mass flow rate trajectory tracking. The outer loop dynamical feedback stabilization control provides also the external fuel mass flow rate perturbation rejection. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation results."
760243,21246,9475,Fluid-based cooperative underwater localization,2013,"Localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is difficult because of the lack of adequate light, distinguishable landmarks and global positioning system (GPS) radio frequency (RF) signals in undersea areas. Due to maneuverability limitations, small AUVs are usually susceptible to strong ocean currents. The impacts of ocean flow on vehicle motion are usually too large to be considered as disturbances. Simulations of large-scale ocean currents are available to track changes of the background flow. Fluid-based multi-vehicle path planning algorithms have been developed to achieve the feasibility in the presence of the background flow and optimized energy consumption. With certain information from both simulations and measurements of the background flow, the performance of multi-AUV cooperative localization can be improved. In this work, a multi-AUV cooperation hierarchy is proposed. More capable AUVs with bounded localization errors are used as localization references to improve the localization performance of other low-cost AUVs. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed and it is verified by using a modified extended Kalman filter (MEKF). This paper focuses on the outline of the algorithm and its associated matching techniques. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on simulations in the flow field generated by the N-vortex system. Localization errors of low-cost AUVs are all bounded at satisfactory levels. The diverging behavior of the pure cooperative localization is effectively avoided."
1364768,21246,9475,Self recovery phenomenon of mechanical systems with an unactuated cyclic variable,2012,"Conservation laws in nature correspond to symmetries of related physical systems (Noether's theorem). Conservation of momentum, for instance, can be interpreted by the symmetric property of a certain motion variable known as the cyclic variable. If a symmetry-breaking force such as a dissipative force or the gravitational force, is applied to the cyclic variable, then the momentum is not conserved any longer in general. The main objective of this paper is to show that there exists a particular type of viscous damping-like force that breaks the symmetry but induces a new conserved quantity in place of the original momentum map. This new conserved quantity can be constructed by combining the time integral of a force linear in velocity and the original momentum map associated with the symmetry. In terms of stability theory of dynamical systems, it can be shown that the existence of the new conserved quantity implies that the corresponding motion variable possesses, as we define in this paper, the self recovery phenomenon. More specifically, the corresponding motion variable will be globally attractive to the initial condition of the variable.We discover that what is fundamental in this self recovery phenomenon is not the positivity of the coefficient of the force linear in the velocity, but certain properties of the time integral of the coefficient function, which can encompass a wide range of viscous damping forces. The self recovery effect and theoretical discoveries are demonstrated by simulation results using two examples: Elroy's beanie, and the torque-controlled inverted pendulum on a passive cart. The results in this paper will be useful in designing and controlling mechanical systems with underactuation."
2449856,21246,9475,Robust performance analysis of uncertain LTI systems: Dual LMI approach and verifications for exactness,2007,"This paper addresses robust performance analysis problems of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems affected by real parametric uncertainties. These problems, known also as a special class of structured singular value computation problems, are inherently intractable (NP-hard problems). As such intensive research effort has been made to obtain computationally tractable and less conservative analysis conditions, where linear matrix inequality (LMI) plays an important. Nevertheless, since LMI-based conditions are expected to be conservative in general, it is often the case that we cannot conclude anything if the LMI at hand turns out to be infeasible. This motivates us to consider the dual of the LMI and examine the structure of the dual solution. By pursuing this direction, in this paper, we provide rank conditions on the dual solution matrix under which we can conclude that the underlying robust performance is never attained. In particular, a set of uncertain parameters that violates the specified performance can be computed. These results come from block-moment matrix structure of the dual variable, which is consistent with the recent results on polynomial optimization. This particular structure enables us to make good use of simultaneous diagonalizability property of commuting diagonalizable matrices so that the sound rank conditions for the exactness verification can be obtained."
2700988,21246,9475,Bayesian identification of LPV Box-Jenkins models,2015,"In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach in a Bayesian setting to efficiently estimate, both in the stochastic and computational sense, linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output models under general noise conditions of Box-Jenkins (BJ) type. The approach is based on the estimation of the one-step-ahead predictor model of general LPV-BJ structures, where the sub-predictors associated with the input and output signals are captured as asymptotically stable infinite impulse response models (IIRs). These IIR sub-predictors are identified in a completely nonparametric sense, where not only the coefficients are estimated as functions, but also the whole time evolution of the impulse response is estimated as a function. In this Bayesian setting, the one-step-ahead predictor is modelled as a zero-mean Gaussian random field, where the covariance function is a multidimensional Gaussian kernel that encodes both the possible structural dependencies and the stability of the predictor. The unknown hyperparameters that parameterize the kernel are tuned using the empirical Bayes approach, i.e., optimization of the marginal likelihood with respect to available data. It is also shown that, in case the predictor has a finite order, i.e., the true system has an ARX noise structure, our approach is able to recover the underlying structural dependencies. The performance of the identification method is demonstrated on LPV-ARX and LPV-BJ simulation examples by means of a Monte Carlo study."
1873955,21246,9475,A multiple-derivative and multiple-delay paradigm for decentralized controller design: uniform-rank systems,2009,"Decentralized feedback systems have long been of interest to the controls community [2], [3], [20]. In recent years, research in decentralized control has been re-invigorated by interest in such applications as cooperative control of autonomous vehicle teams, data fusion in sensor networks, air traffic management, and virus-spreading control, among many others, see the overviews [15]–[18] and also e.g. the articles [6], [19], [23]. These numerous network-control applications are widely varied: they have vastly different scales, may consist of autonomous-but-sensing agents (like vehicle teams) or may be hardwired (like electric power systems), and require a wide array of control and/or algorithmic capabilities. What these varying applications make clear, however, is that new tools for designing decentralized controllers are badly needed: ones that permit highly limited components subject to delay and variation to complete intricate tasks by exploiting the network's topological structure. As the need for topology-exploiting decentralized controllers has become clear, efforts to understand the role of a network's topology in its dynamics upon control have been initiated, but the core design problem remains to be addressed."
2948038,21246,9475,A leader-follower architecture for Load Frequency Control purposes against cyber attacks in power grids - Part II,2016,"In this paper, we present a novel control architecture capable to deal with the constrained Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem in a distributed way and to jointly manage time-delay attacks on the communication links existing amongst power areas and a set of high level controllers located at remote sides. The starting idea consists in abstractly modeling the power grid as a leader-follower configuration so that a first input -first output protocol can be adopted to compute adequate control actions. The latter is achieved by resorting to an overlapping system description which prescribes that several areas of the power grid concur to obtain a single element of the leader-follower structure. The approach is based on to the reachability analysis developed in [3] where sequences of one-step ahead controllable sets have been formally derived by taking into account existing state/input constraints, distributed structure of the problem and data loss occurrences due to possible cyber attacks. Simulations put in light the reconfiguration capabilities of the proposed framework that allow one to “isolate” the attacked power units which in principle could compromise the overall operation mode of the power grid."
1059885,21246,9475,KPCA based multi-spectral segments feature extraction and GA based Combinatorial optimization for frequency spectrum data modeling,2011,"Mill load (ML) estimation plays a major role in improving the grinding production rate (GPR) and the product quality of the grinding process. The ML parameters, such as mineral to ball volume ratio (MBVR), pulp density (PD) and charge volume ratio (CVR), reflect the load inside the ball mill accurately. The relative amplitudes of the high-dimensional frequency spectrum of shell vibration signals contain the information about the ML parameters. In this paper, a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) based multi-spectral segments feature extraction and genetic algorithm (GA) based Combinatorial optimization method is proposed to estimate the ML parameters. Spectral peak clustering algorithm based knowledge is first used to partition the spectrum into several segments with their physical meaning. Then, the spectral principal components (PCs) of different segments are extracted using KPCA. The candidate input features are serial combinated with mill power. At last, GA with Akaike's information criteria (AIC) is used to select the input features and the parameters for the least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has higher accuracy and better predictive performance than the other normal approaches."
2510595,21246,9475,Control of nondeterministic discrete-event systems for bisimulation equivalence,2004,"Most prior work on supervisory control of discrete event systems is for achieving deterministic specifications, expressed as formal languages. In this paper we study supervisory control for achieving nondeterministic specifications. Such specifications are useful when designing a system at a higher level of abstraction so that lower level details of system and its specification are omitted to obtain higher level models that may be nondeterministic. Nondeterministic specifications are also meaningful when the system to be controlled has a nondeterministic model due to the lack of information (caused for example by partial observation or unmodeled dynamics). Language equivalence is not an adequate notion of behavioral equivalence for nondeterministic systems, and instead we use the finest known notion of equivalence, namely the bisimulation equivalence. Choice of bisimulation equivalence is also supported by the fact that bisimulation equivalence specification is equivalent to a specification in the temporal logic of /spl mu/-calculus that subsumes the complete branching-time logic CTL*. Given nondeterministic models of system and its specification, we study the design of a supervisor (possibly nondeterministic) such that the controlled system is bisimilar to the specification. We obtain a small model theorem showing that a supervisor exists if and only if it exists over a certain finite state space, namely the power set of Cartesian product of system and specification state spaces. Also, the notion of state-controllability is introduced as part of a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a supervisor. In the special case of deterministic systems, we provide an existence condition that can be verified polynomially in both system and specification states, when the existence condition holds."
1844674,21246,9475,Integral Reinforcement Learning for online computation of feedback Nash strategies of nonzero-sum differential games,2010,"This paper presents an Approximate/Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm that finds online the Nash equilibrium for two-player nonzero-sum differential games with linear dynamics and infinite horizon quadratic cost. Each of the game players is using the procedure of Integral Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to calculate online the infinite horizon value function that it associates with every given set of feedback control policies. It will be shown that the online algorithm is mathematically equivalent to an offline iterative method, previously introduced in the literature, that solves the set of coupled algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) underlying the game problem using complete knowledge on the system dynamics. Here we show how the ADP techniques will enhance the capabilities of the offline method allowing an online solution without the requirement of complete knowledge of the system dynamics. The two participants in the continuous-time differential game are competing in real-time and the feedback Nash control strategies will be determined based on online measured data from the system. The algorithm is built on interplay between a learning phase, where each of the players is learning online the value that they associate with a given set of play policies, and a policy update step, performed by each of the payers towards decreasing the value of their cost. The players are learning concurrently. The feasibility of the ADP scheme is demonstrated in simulation."
2711568,21246,9475,Modelling the aggregate demand response of a population of air conditioners to changes in ambient temperature,2015,"A substantial amount of research in recent years has investigated the direct load control (DLC) of populations of air conditioners (ACs) to provide demand-side services in the electricity grid. In many existing approaches, the control of aggregate power demand of these populations requires the knowledge of distributed physical parameters, such as the rated thermal power of the ACs and the thermal capacitances of the air-conditioned spaces. These parameters can be identified from DLC trials on a real-world population. However, such trials typically need to engage participants and fit their ACs with DLC-enabling devices for monitoring and control, which can be costly and may raise privacy concerns. This paper develops an alternative approach that allows the non-intrusive identification of distributed parameters for DLC. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical model that describes the dynamic aggregate demand response of a population of ACs to changes in ambient temperature, rather than to a control signal. The parameters of the proposed model can then be identified from ambient temperature and aggregate demand data from sufficiently warm days, which are inexpensive to collect and do not need the direct engagement of participants in the target population. A key benefit of the new model is that its identified parameters also fit a previously developed dynamic model for DLC of aggregate demand of ACs, which completes a practical solution to model-based feedback control design for DLC in such populations."
790728,21246,9475,Generic and generalized boundary operating points in piecewise-linear (discontinuous) control systems,2012,"Switching control strategies introducing a discontinuity in the closed-loop equations are widely used in different fields of science and engineering. When an operating point that is viable for one of the available control actions attains a switching boundary, as a process or control parameter is varied, two generic scenarios are possible: either the operating point turns into a pseudo-equilibrium on the boundary (persistence), so the stationary solution persists through the bifurcation and a sliding mode control is initiated; or it collides and disappears together with a previously coexisting pseudo-equilibrium (nonsmooth-fold), triggering a transient toward another attractor of the control system. In this paper we analyze the degenerate situation separating these two scenarios—the codimension-2 bifurcation called Generalized Boundary Equilibrium (GBE) in the literature on Filippov systems—in the special case of piecewise-linear control systems. We apply our results in power electronics, where the desired operating point often works in sliding mode. In particular, we analyze a three-dimensional model of DC-DC boost converter, where the GBE bifurcation—though occurring for non operative values of the control parameters—plays a critical role in identifying the operative regions of the electrical and control parameters."
720202,21246,9475,Integrated electric vehicle control by differential parameterization,2011,"The design of a tracking controller for electric cars in x-by-wire structure is presented to assign trajectories for the coordinates of the vehicle structure, which are shown to be a flat output. The model of the car is a detailed nonlinear two-track vehicle with all degrees of freedom in the three-dimensional space provided with redundant actuation. Each tire is equipped with two salient pole permanent magnet (PM-)synchronous machines for steering and driving. For the controller design, an overall model with a special differential-algebraic structure is derived. The tire forces and the torques of the electrical machines are used as fictitious inputs. With this particular modeling it is possible to decouple the dynamic part of the model in the given coordinates at the highest relative degree. To get a consistent behavior it is necessary to account for some algebraic constraints, in this case given by the tire model and the torque equations of the PM-synchronous machines. It is possible to parameterize all constraints and coordinates of the drive units by the coordinates of the vehicle structure and its derivatives. All these parameterizations can be derived analytically. With an additional tracking controller the approach is robust against parameter variations and pulse-shaped disturbances. The control of the electrical machines is integrated in the overall control law. By introducing additional coupling conditions it is possible to generate the desired torque for steering and driving by minimum current."
930538,21246,9475,Air supply system of a PEM fuel cell model: Passivity and robust PI control,2011,"Fuel cells are widely regarded as potential future power sources, they convert the chemical energy of a gaseous fuel directly into electricity. In this paper, the study is concentrated on the control of the air subsystem that feeds the fuel cell cathode with oxygen—whose dynamics is described with a widely accepted nonlinear model. Due to the complexity of this model, the model-based controllers that have been proposed for this application are designed using its linear approximation at a given equilibrium point, which might lead to conservative stability margin estimates. On the other hand, practitioners propose the use of simple proportional or proportional-integral controllers around the compressor flow, which ensures good performance in most applications. Using some monotonicity characteristics of the system, in this paper we provide the theoretical justification to this scheme, proving that this output variable has the remarkable property that the linearization (around any admissible equilibrium) of the input-output map is strictly passive. Hence, the controllers used in applications yield (locally) asymptotically stable loops—for any desired equilibrium point and all values of the controller gains. Ensuring stability for all tuning gains overcomes the inherent conservativeness of linearized dynamics analysis, and assures robustness and high performance."
2073633,21246,9475,Modeling neural spiking activity in the sub-thalamic nucleus of Parkinson’s patients and a healthy primate,2008,"How neurons encode information about the outside world and how this processing changes when the brain is diseased are central questions in neuroscience and medicine. Historically, microelectrode recordings of single-unit neuronal activity have been confined to animal preparations. Recently, it has become possible to obtain single-unit recordings in humans undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. In this study, we recorded neuronal activity from the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In parallel, identical experiments were conducted on a healthy primate, providing a rare opportunity to analyze STN neuronal activity recorded in both the disease and healthy state during the same behavioral tasks. We developed point process models of STN neurons to capture neural spiking dynamics as a function of extrinsic stimuli and the neuron's own spiking history. Although our findings are preliminary due to only one primate subject, we found pathological signatures in PD neural activity (not found in the primate) such as bursting, 10-30 Hz oscillations, and directional tuning prior to movement, which may directly relate to motor disorders observed in PD patients such as bradyk inesia, resting tremor and rigidity."
1701703,21246,9475,A point process model-based framework reveals reinforcement mechanisms in striatum during high frequency STN DBS,2012,"Striatum is a major stage of the motor loop but, despite a pivotal role in the execution of movements, it has been poorly studied thus far under Parkinsonian conditions and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). We propose a computational framework to analyze the spiking activity of striatal neurons under several conditions. This framework combines point process models and single unit recordings, and separately evaluates the effects of the spiking history, DBS frequency, and other cells on the neuronal discharge pattern, thus giving a full characterization of non-stationary neuronal dynamics and inter-neuronal dependencies. We applied this framework to 166 striatal neurons collected in a monkey both at rest and during DBS (30–130 Hz). Our analysis was conducted both before and after treatment of the animal with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which evoked Parkinsonian-like motor disorders. We reported that high frequency (≥100 Hz) DBS reduces non-stationary dynamics and inter-neuronal dependencies by regularizing the discharge patterns both in MPTP and normal striatum, while the combination of MPTP and low frequency (30–80 Hz) DBS enhances these features, thus suggesting that pattern regularization in striatum might contribute to the therapeutic effect of high frequency DBS and presumably results from the overlap of feed-forward and feedback activation along the motor loop (reinforcement)."
1232753,21246,9475,Optimization-based estimation of random distributed parameters in elliptic partial differential equations,2012,"As simulation continues to replace experimentation in the design cycle, the need to quantify uncertainty in model outputs due to uncertainties in the model parameters becomes critical. For distributed parameter models, current approaches assume the mean and variance of parameters are known, then use recently developed efficient numerical methods for approximating stochastic partial differential equations. However, the statistical descriptions of the model parameters are rarely known. A number of recent works have investigated adapting existing variational methods for parameter estimation to account for parametric uncertainty. In this paper, we formulate the parameter identification problem as an infinite dimensional constrained optimization problem for which we establish existence of minimizers and the first order necessary conditions. A spectral approximation of the uncertain observations (via a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion) allows an approximation of the infinite dimensional problem by a smooth, albeit high dimensional, deterministic optimization problem, the so-called ‘finite noise’ problem, in the space of functions with bounded mixed derivatives. We prove convergence of ‘finite noise’ minimizers to the corresponding infinite dimensional solutions, and devise a gradient based strategy for locating these numerically. Lastly, we illustrate our method with a numerical example."
1732375,21246,9475,On the role of ultrasensitivity in biomolecular control systems,2012,"One of the most important design parameters in synthetic biological circuits is the gain of the system. In many naturally occurring biological control systems, however, the precise role of the gain in ensuring accurate control is unclear. In this study, we employ control theory to explore the role of gain in osmoregulation. It has been well-documented that the upstream signalling pathways involved in this system implement high levels of ultrasensitivity, however, the role of such high gain in producing the observed perfect adaptation is not clear. Indeed, it has been argued that a simple integral feedback controller can explain osmoadaptation without the need for high gain. Here, we extend a recently developed proportional controller model for this system with the implementation of ultrasenstivity. We evaluate the performance of the resulting two controllers under different biological assumptions and allowing different levels of gain. We find that a proportional controller implementing ultrasensitivity allows more precise and faster adaptation of cell volume following an osmo-shock. Such an input-output relationship can be tuned as a filter, where the proportional controller couldn't, and thereby allowing responses to signals above a certain threshold. Our results provide insights on the potential role of gain in biological systems, and should be of interest to synthetic biologists attempting to design biomolecular control systems."
557826,21246,9475,Exact and efficient Hamilton-Jacobi reachability for decoupled systems,2015,"Reachability analysis is important for studying optimal control problems and differential games, which are powerful theoretical tools for analyzing and modeling many practical problems in robotics, aircraft control, among other application areas. In reachability analysis, one is interested in computing the reachable set, defined as the set of states from which there exists a control, despite the worst disturbance, that can drive the system into a set of target states. The target states can be used to model either unsafe or desirable configurations, depending on the application. Many Hamilton-Jacobi formulations allow the computation of reachable sets; however, due to the exponential complexity scaling in computation time and space, problems involving approximately 5 dimensions become intractable. A number of methods that compute an approximate solution exist in the literature, but these methods trade off complexity for optimality. In this paper, we eliminate complexity-optimality trade-offs for time-invariant decoupled systems using a decoupled Hamilton-Jacobi formulation that enables the exact reconstruction of high dimensional solutions via low dimensional solutions of the decoupled subsystems. Our formulation is compatible with existing numerical tools, and we show the accuracy, computation benefits, and an application of our novel approach using two numerical examples."
1137430,21246,9475,Utilizing Automated Demand Response in commercial buildings as non-spinning reserve product for ancillary services markets,2011,"In 2009, a pilot program was conducted to investigate the technical feasibility of bidding non-residential demand response (DR) resources into the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) day-ahead ancillary services market as non-spinning reserves product. Three facilities, a retail store, a local government office building, and a bakery, were recruited into the pilot program and moved from automated price responsive programs to CAISO's participating load program. For each facility, hourly demand, and load curtailment potential were forecasted two days ahead and submitted to the CAISO the day before the trading day as an available resource. These DR resources were optimized against all other generation resources in the CAISO ancillary services market. Each facility was equipped with four-second real time telemetry equipment to ensure resource accountability and visibility to CAISO operators. When CAISO requests DR resources, OpenADR (Open Automated DR) communications infrastructure was utilized to deliver DR signals to the facilities' energy management and control systems. The pre-programmed DR strategies were triggered without a human in the loop. This paper describes the automated system architecture with detailed description of meter feedback in the DR signaling to maintain demand reduction at the government office building. The results showed that OpenADR infrastructure could be used for some products for the ancillary services market and DR strategies for heating ventilation and air conditioning and lighting provide fast enough response to participate in non-spinning reserve product in the ancillary services market."
2147063,21246,9475,A distributed auction algorithm for the assignment problem,2008,"The assignment problem constitutes one of the fundamental problems in the context of linear programming. Besides its theoretical significance, its frequent appearance in the areas of distributed control and facility allocation, where the problems? size and the cost for global computation and information can be highly prohibitive, gives rise to the need for local solutions that dynamically assign distinct agents to distinct tasks, while maximizing the total assignment benefit. In this paper, we consider the linear assignment problem in the context of networked systems, where the main challenge is dealing with the lack of global information due to the limited communication capabilities of the agents. We address this challenge by means of a distributed auction algorithm, where the agents are able to bid for the task to which they wish to be assigned. The desired assignment relies on an appropriate selection of bids that determine the prices of the tasks and render them more or less attractive for the agents to bid for. Up to date pricing information, necessary for accurate bidding, can be obtained in a multi-hop fashion by means of local communication between adjacent agents. Our algorithm is an extension to the parallel auction algorithm proposed by Bertsekas et al to the case where only local information is available and it is shown to always converge to an assignment that maximizes the total assignment benefit within a linear approximation of the optimal one."
2572022,21246,9475,Controller compensator conversions to estimator-controller forms,2010,"In this paper, the problem of converting linear time-invariant compensators to their corresponding state estimator- or observer-based feedback control forms is considered for the case of not necessarily strictly proper plants and controllers. For the full-order state estimator-controller conversion case, subtle but important differences between two earlier works are noted and discussed; as well, sufficient conditions for an invariant property involving the product of candidate control feedback and estimator update gain parameters are given, and for the specific case of single-input single-output systems having a specified plant and controller model, it is shown how this product always is equal to a constant. In the reduced-order state observer-controller conversion case based upon the method of Luenberger, new necessary conditions for the existence of real-valued solutions are specified, and explicit corresponding analytic design equations are provided. Within this particular reduced-order framework, these results highlight how general candidate solutions only are available under certain specific a priori conditions. Simulations of conversion results when applied to a conventional hard disk drive plant and discrete-time control system additionally are presented, and concordance results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of such transformation schemes."
759132,21246,9475,An islet population model of pancreatic insulin production,2013,"Glucose-induced pancreatic insulin release is the fundamental mechanism responsible for glucose homeostasis, its failure determining the clinical picture of Diabetes Mellitus. The details of the feedback loop controlling glycemia through insulin secretion have been an important subject of investigation and modeling for decades. In this note, a recently published population model is considered, whose purpose is to replicate in silico different observed phenomena such as low frequency glycemia-insulinemia oscillations, as well as concordant induction of high-frequency insulin oscillations. The basic idea underlying this model is that the pancreas behaves like a population of independent controllers (each consisting of a fundamental secreting unit, a pancreatic islet), all reacting to the same glucose stimulus, but with varying performance characteristics. This idea has been supported by a relatively wide range of simulations, aiming to replicate most important in vivo experiments concerning pancreatic insulin release. It will be shown in this note that the same mathematical structure can also replicate a set of in vitro experiments, provided that the model context is adapted to the structure of the different experiments to be simulated. More in details, the model will be shown to reproduce the double phase of insulin release during a prolonged glucose stimulus: a first phase of impulsive insulin release, immediately upon glucose administration, and a second phase of more gradual release, dependent on the potentiation effect of the secretory units."
1441770,21246,9475,An initialization method for monocular visual localization of miniature aerial robots,2011,"This paper proposes a method to initiate the pose of an aerial robot from a glimpse of a monocular view during the rapid take-off. Unlike the existing filter-based methods that failed to estimate pose due to insufficient baseline, this paper utilizes a unified projective parametrization and a progressively suppressed refinement scheme for the non-planar homography estimations to tackle the baseline initialization problem, which has been notoriously and persistently encountered in the field of aerial robotics. Without pruning the elliptical uncertainty spheres iteratively in a filter-based framework as in the existing methods, the proposed method associates the unknown scene points and the pose of the agile aerial robot in a unified projective parametrization, and leverages a hypothesis-and-verify scheme to facilitate the decompositions of the non-planar homographies in line with a series of essential matrices. Moreover, a progressively suppressed strategy is introduced to minimize the hypothetic errors in the homographies and to minimize estimation divergence. Therefore, even with only a glance through a single camera onboard an aerial robot, a referable poses of the aerial robot can be initiated for the immediate navigation. In addition, the empirical results demonstrates that this method not only yields a consistent and referable estimation of the 6DoF pose of the robot in parallel with the agile movement of take-off, but also withstands the loop-closure evaluation in the 3D space."
1798434,21246,9475,Tree codes improve convergence rate of consensus over erasure channels,2012,"We study the problem of achieving average consensus between a group of agents over a network with erasure links. In the context of consensus problems, the unreliability of communication links between nodes has been traditionally modeled by allowing the underlying graph to vary with time. In other words, depending on the realization of the link erasures, the underlying graph at each time instant is assumed to be a subgraph of the original graph. Implicit in this model is the assumption that the erasures are symmetric: if at time t the packet from node i to node j is dropped, the same is true for the packet transmitted from node j to node i. However, in practical wireless communication systems this assumption is unreasonable and, due to the lack of symmetry, standard averaging protocols cannot guarantee that the network will reach consensus to the true average. In this paper we explore the use of channel coding to improve the performance of consensus algorithms. For symmetric erasures, we show that, for certain ranges of the system parameters, repetition codes can speed up the convergence rate. For asymmetric erasures we show that tree codes (which have recently been designed for erasure channels) can be used to simulate the performance of the original “unerased” graph. Thus, unlike conventional consensus methods, we can guarantee convergence to the average in the asymmetric case. The price is a slowdown in the convergence rate, relative to the unerased network, which is still often faster than the convergence rate of conventional consensus algorithms over noisy links."
2692509,21246,9475,Simulation-based work load and job release control for semiconductor manufacturing,2015,"Cycle time and capacity management are two of the most important issues for manufacturing companies, particularly in a dynamic business environment. The goal is to meet customer delivery dates while minimizing manufacturing cost. Semiconductor manufacturing involves a large number of process steps, reentrant process flows and long production cycle times. In addition, technological innovation in the semiconductor industry is rapid, resulting in shorter product life cycles. Thus, semiconductor manufacturing companies must continually invest in order to keep pace with new technology and update their equipment to produce new products. These conditions make cycle time and capacity management more important for semiconductor manufacturing companies. For the purpose of stable control of cycle time and capacity, there have been many studies dealing with semiconductor manufacturing shop floor control. This paper focuses on job release control, which aims to keep the work load stable and meet customer delivery dates in the presence of dynamic demand fluctuations. We introduce a hierarchical control model which consists of two layers: a long-term capacity decision model and a short-term job release control model. Parameters of the proposed linear programming (LP) models are estimated using simulation, which acts as an intermediate layer between the two layers. Numerical experiments on a mini-fab demonstrate the potential gains from using our model, which achieves improved customer delivery and shorter cycle time relative to several conventional job release policies."
1986988,21246,9475,LQG control for distributed systems over TCP-like erasure channels,2007,"This paper is concerned with control applications over lossy data network. Sensor data is transmitted to an estimation-control unit over a network and control commands are issued to subsystems over the same network. Sensor and control packets may be randomly lost according to a Bernoulli process. In this context the discrete-time Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control problem is considered. In B. Sinopoli, et al., (Aug. 2003) a complete analysis was carried out for the case the network is composed of a single sensor and control channel. Here a nontrivial generalization to the case of sensor and actuator networks with p distinct sensor channels and m control channels is presented. It has been proven that the separation principle still holds for all protocols where packets are acknowledged by the receiver (e.g. TCP-like protocols). Moreover it has been pointed out for the first time that the optimal LQG control is a linear function of the state that explicitly depends on the command channels lost probabilities. Such a dependence is not present in pre-existing literature, since the amplitude of each control input has to be weighted by the loss probability associated to its own channel. This is not observed in the single channel case. In the infinite horizon case stability conditions on the arrival are derived. Their computation requires the use of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)."
2903965,21246,9475,Online learning of Contextual Hidden Markov Models for temporal-spatial data analysis,2016,"The problem of mining a network of time series data naturally arises in many research areas including energy system, quantitative finance, bioinformatics, environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring, etc. Among others, two emerging challenges shared by manifold applications are (1) the modeling of temporal-spatial dependence with contextual information and (2) the design of efficient learning algorithms for big data (exceedingly long sequence) analytics. In this paper, we study a Contextual Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) that describes infinite temporal dependence and contextual spatial relations in an unified framework. More importantly, to make model training feasible for growing number of data samples, we develop an Online Expectation-Maximization (OEM) algorithm that avoids the usual forward-backward pass of the entire time sequence. Two typical applications, missing value recovery and novelty detection, are considered to test CHMM and the online algorithm. Experiments are conducted on real world data collected from power distribution network monitoring. We compare CHMM with other popular methods and the results not only justify the benefit of incorporating temporal-spatial and contextual information, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OEM algorithm."
1977891,21246,9475,Using economic Model Predictive Control to design sustainable policies for mitigating climate change,2012,"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now an important and pressing matter. Systems control theory, and in particular feedback control, can contribute to the design of policies that achieve sustainable levels of emissions of CO 2  (and other greenhouse gases) while minimizing the impact on the economy, and at the same time explicitly addressing the high levels of uncertainty associated with predictions of future emissions. In this paper, preliminary results are described for an approach where economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied to a Regional dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE model) as a test bed to design savings rates and global carbon tax for greenhouse gas emissions. Using feedback control, the policies are updated on the basis of the observed emissions, rather than on the predicted level of emissions. The basic structure and principle of the RICE model is firstly introduced and some key equations are described. The idea of introducing feedback control is then explained and economic MPC is applied to design policies for CO 2  emissions. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for two different scenarios. Feedback control design provides a degree of robustness against disturbances and model uncertainties, which is illustrated through a simulation study with two particular types of uncertainties. The results obtained in this paper illustrate the strength of the proposed design approach and form the basis for future research on using systems control theory to design optimal sustainable policies."
1146720,21246,9475,Consensus and polarization in Altafini's model with bidirectional time-varying network topologies,2014,"The mechanism of reaching consensus in multi-agent systems has been exhaustively studied in recent years, motivated by numerous applications in engineering and science. Most consensus algorithms examined in the literature are based on the assumption about mutual trust and cooperation between the agents, implemented in the form of attractive couplings between the agents that render the values of the agents' states closer. However, in opinion dynamics of social groups, competition or antagonism between some pairs of agents is ubiquitous, which is usually characterized by the repulsive coupling, and may lead to clustering and polarization of opinions. A simple yet insightful model of opinion dynamics with antagonistic interactions was proposed recently by C. Altafini, which examined conventional first-order consensus algorithms with static signed interaction graphs, where the positive weight of an arc implies cooperation between the two agents and the negative one corresponds to antagonism. This protocol establishes modulus consensus, where the opinions become the same in modulus but may differ in sign. In the present paper, we extend the modulus consensus model to the case where the network topology is time-varying and undirected. We give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the consensus protocol with the time-varying signed Laplacian establishes agreement of opinions in moduli, whose signs may be opposite, so that the agents' opinions either reach consensus or polarize."
791195,21246,9475,Belief convergence to facilitate cooperative behaviors,2012,"In Artificial Intelligence (AI), utility functions are used to compare the relative goodness of an AI system making one decision over another. These utility functions, along with their coefficients and parameters, comprise a set of beliefs. The term “belief” is used to describe how autonomous systems associate quantified confidences in the existence of things that make up their worldly knowledge; hence, decisions made by an AI system are governed by the states of its belief. Just as in control system theory where the states are quantities used to estimate and describe the behaviors of electrical and/or mechanical systems, belief states are quantities that are used to describe and estimate decision making characteristics. For evolving AI systems (e.g., ones that change their belief states over time through learning) and heterogeneous systems (e.g., ones that do not share a common notion of a global belief), it is important to develop mechanisms that will allow these systems to converge their beliefs, where they can determine how each other “thinks.” This is important since it will allow each agent in a cooperating collective to make decisions that optimally solves their individual needs, along with their collective needs, without requiring explicit communication or a mediator. In this paper, methodologies are presented that facilitate belief convergence. The significance of this study is that we demonstrate how a state observer, such as a Kalman filter, can be used by each agent in a collective to estimate neighboring belief states. This is done with no a priori information of their neighbors' belief states, and by only comparing each individual's estimate for the required effort of the whole collective to perform a group plan."
2968894,21246,9475,Unscented state estimation for rigid body attitude motion with a finite-time stable observer,2016,"A discrete-time attitude state estimation scheme that uses a global representation of the configuration space for rigid body attitude motion, is presented. This estimation scheme uses discrete-time state measurements of inertially known vectors along with rate gyro measurements of the angular velocity, to obtain state estimates in the filtering stage. Additionally, a set of sigma points is obtained from the unscented transform based on exponential coordinates, with re-sampling centered at the current state estimate at each measurement instant. The state estimates along with sampled sigma points are propagated between measurement instants, using a discrete-time attitude state observer that is almost globally finite-time stable. The propagated sigma points and state estimate are enclosed by a minimum volume ellipsoid at the measurement instant. It is assumed that all states are measured at a constant measurement sample rate and that state measurement errors are bounded by an ellipsoidal bound. The update stage of the filter consists of finding the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid that contains the propagated sigma points and the measurement uncertainty bound. This updated ellipsoid provides the filtered uncertainty bound and its center provides the updated state estimate. A new set of sigma points is selected from this ellipsoid and the propagation and update steps are repeated between measurement instants. Numerical simulation results confirm the analytically obtained stability properties of the attitude state observer. Numerical results also show that state estimate errors are bounded in the presence of bounded measurement noise and bounded disturbance torque."
1881586,21246,9475,A moments-based approach to estimation and data interpolation for a class of Wiener systems,2010,"This paper addresses the problems of estimating the values of both the outputs and the internal signals for a class of Wiener systems consisting of the cascade of an unknown linear time invariant systems and a known, rational, generically non-invertible nonlinearity, based solely on past input/output data corrupted by noise. This situation arises in many scenarios of practical interest where an explicit a-priori model of the linear system is not available. Examples include extracting geometric 3D structure from a sequence of 2D images (structure from motion), and nonlinear dimensionality reduction via manifold embedding. The main result of the paper is a simple, computationally efficient algorithm that is capable of handling intermittent measurements and does not entail identifying first the unknown linear dynamics. Rather, the problem of estimating the internal signals and interpolating missing data is recast into a rank-constrained feasibility problem. Although this problem depends polynomially in the data, we show that, by appealing to classical results on moments optimization, it can be reduced to a rank-constrained Linear Matrix Inequality optimization and efficiently solved using existing techniques. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated by solving structure from motion problems using real data."
2948278,21246,9475,Stochastic optimization with value function approximation for micro-grid operation,2016,"Operational planning of a small and isolated energy system having a large wind farm and a battery storage device is studied. Operational planning decisions are to be made in two time-scales: daily unit commitment (UC) and hourly dispatch. For this problem, Markov decision process (MDP) and stochastic programming (SP) are combined to account for both daily and hourly changes of wind uncertainty. Two stage SP is formulated for day-ahead UC decision and dispatch decisions considering a number of scenarios regarding uncertainty with respect to hourly ramping of the wind within a day. Here, the value of the end state of daily unit commitment and battery with respect to the future beyond the day (value function), which is estimated from the MDP formulation, is included in the objective function to ensure that longer term implications of the decisions are considered. In the MDP formulation, daily evolving exogenous information on wind speed is captured, and the value function is approximated with a linear model. The coefficient vector of the linear model is recursively updated with sampled observations estimated from the daily SP model. In connection with this, a general wind model for timescales from seasonal to hourly is developed to enable seamless connection of the decision making across the scales. The results of the proposed integrated method are compared to those of just the two-stage SP model through a case study and real wind data."
1206821,21246,9475,Efficient interior point methods for multistage problems arising in receding horizon control,2012,"Receding horizon control requires the solution of an optimization problem at every sampling instant. We present efficient interior point methods tailored to convex multistage problems, a problem class which most relevant MPC problems with linear dynamics can be cast in, and specify important algorithmic details required for a high speed implementation with superior numerical stability. In particular, the presented approach allows for quadratic constraints, which is not supported by existing fast MPC solvers. A categorization of widely used MPC problem formulations into classes of different complexity is given, and we show how the computational burden of certain quadratic or linear constraints can be decreased by a low rank matrix forward substitution scheme. Implementation details are provided that are crucial to obtain high speed solvers.We present extensive numerical studies for the proposed methods and compare our solver to three well-known solver packages, outperforming the fastest of these by a factor 2–5 in speed and 3–70 in code size. Moreover, our solver is shown to be very efficient for large problem sizes and for quadratically constrained QPs, extending the set of systems amenable to advanced MPC formulations on low-cost embedded hardware."
1208679,21246,9475,Shrinking complexity of scheduling dependencies in LS-SVM based LPV system identification,2014,"In the past years, Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) identification has rapidly evolved from parametric identification methods to nonparametric methods allowing the relaxation of restrictive assumptions. For example, Least-Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) offer an attractive way of estimating LPV models directly from data without requiring from the user to specify the functional dependencies of the model coefficients on the scheduling variable. These methods have also been recently extended in order to automatically determine the model order directly from data by the help of regularization. Nonetheless, despite all these recent improvements, LPV identification methods still require some strong a priori such as i) the dependencies are static or dynamic, ii) it is known which variables are considered to be the scheduling or iii) all coefficient functions of the underlaying system depend on all scheduling variables. This prevents the complexity of the scheduling dependency of the model to be shrunk gradually and independently until an optimal bias-variance trade off is found. In this paper, a novel reformulation of the LPV LS-SVM approach is proposed which, besides of the non-parametric estimation of the coefficient functions, achieves data-driven coefficient complexity selection via convex optimization. The properties of the introduced approach are illustrated by a simulation study."
1077243,21246,9475,A model-free technique for designing fixed-order controllers,2013,"This paper suggests a model-free control design technique for unknown stable single-input-single-output (SISO) systems. In traditional control design approaches, a mathematical model of the plant is first identified using a set of measurements, then a controller is designed on the basis of this model. However, the use of such identified models, which are often subject to several uncertainties due to the complexity involved in many practical applications, usually results in degradation of the controller performance. Unlike model-based control approaches, we propose here to directly utilize the measured data in the controller design without going through a model identification. Our proposed control method consists in finding a suitable fixed-order controller for which the closed-loop frequency response is very close to a desired frequency response that describes some desired closed-loop performance indices. This problem is formulated as a minimization problem, where the objective function is defined by the integral of the squared relative error between the closed-loop frequency response and the desired frequency response. The main feature of our proposed method is that the design process does not depend on the increasing order and complexity of the system. Moreover, it enables to design low-order controllers. For simulation purposes, a PID controller is designed to illustrate the feasibility and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique."
798220,21246,9475,Blind identification of sparse dynamic networks and applications,2011,"This paper considers the problem of identifying the topology of a sparsely interconnected network of dynamical systems from experimental noisy data. Specifically, we assume that the observed data was generated by an underlying, unknown graph topology where each node corresponds to a given time-series and each link to an unknown autoregressive model that maps those time series. The goal is to recover the sparsest (in the sense of having the fewest number of links) structure compatible with some a-priori information and capable of explaining the observed data. Contrary to related existing work, our framework allows for (unmeasurable) exogenous inputs, intended to model relatively infrequent events such as environmental or set-point changes in the underlying processes. The main result of the paper shows that both the network topology and the unknown inputs can be identified by solving a convex optimization problem, obtained by combining Group-Lasso type arguments with a re-weighted heuristics. As shown here, this combination leads to substantially sparser topologies than using either group Lasso or orthogonal decomposition based algorithms. These results are illustrated using both academic examples and several non-trivial problems drawn from multiple application domains that include finances, biology and computer vision."
2683323,21246,9475,Personalized cancer therapy design: Robustness vs. optimality,2016,"Intermittent Androgen Suppression (IAS) is a treatment strategy for delaying or even preventing time to relapse of advanced prostate cancer. IAS consists of alternating cycles of therapy (in the form of androgen suppression) and off-treatment periods. The level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in a patient's serum is frequently monitored to determine when the patient will be taken off therapy and when therapy will resume. In spite of extensive recent clinical experience with IAS, the design of an ideal protocol for any given patient remains one of the main challenges associated with effectively implementing this therapy. We use a threshold-based policy for optimal IAS therapy design that is parameterized by lower and upper PSA threshold values and is associated with a cost metric that combines clinically relevant measures of therapy success. We apply Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to a Stochastic Hybrid Automaton (SHA) model of prostate cancer evolution under IAS and derive unbiased estimators of the cost metric gradient with respect to various model and therapy parameters. These estimators are subsequently used for system analysis. By evaluating sensitivity estimates with respect to several model parameters, we identify critical ones and demonstrate that relaxing the optimality condition in favor of increased robustness to modeling errors provides an alternative objective to therapy design for at least some patients."
1142576,21246,9475,A Generalized Kalman Consensus Filter for wide-area video networks,2011,"Distributed analysis of video captured by a large network of cameras has received significant attention lately. Tracking moving targets is one of the most fundamental tasks in this regard and the well-known Kalman Consensus Filter (KCF) has been applied to this problem. However, existing solutions do not consider the specific characteristics of video sensor networks, which are necessary for robustness across various application scenarios. Cameras are directional sensors with limited sensing range (field-of-view), and thus, targets are often not observed by many of the cameras. The network may also be spread over a wide area, preventing direct communication between all of the cameras. This limited field-of-view, combined with sparse communication and coverage topologies, motivates us to propose modifications to the traditional KCF framework. Specifically, we consider the covariance matrices of the state estimates of the neighbors and compute a weighted average consensus estimate at each node. Also, the update at each node is computed in two steps, first towards the weighted consensus estimate and then towards the final Kalman measurement update. This leads us to propose a Generalized KCF herein. Experimental results clearly show the advantage of the GKCF compared to the KCF in the considered application scenario."
2956538,21246,9475,Exploring the impact of resource limitations on gene network reconstruction,2016,"The characterization of biological networks via mathematical models often involves cycles of experimental perturbations and measurements, followed by the use of a network inference method. Here we study an engineered genetic circuit, introduced in a recent paper by the authors, and report additional analysis and interpretation. Using this synthetic network as a benchmark, we find that the application of the modular response analysis (MRA) network inference method leads to the discovery of a hidden, nontrivial “ghost” regulatory edge, which was not explicitly engineered into the network. Importantly, this result is not evident from direct inspection of the experimental measurements and global response coefficients. To probe the global to local conversion in MRA, we use conditionally randomized global response matrices to obtain distributions of local response coefficients and demonstrate that sign changes are numerically possible. Additionally, using simulations of a cascade network in a biochemical setting which does not take into account resource limitations, we show that MRA cannot return “ghost” edges, which points to the impact of the cellular milieu and in particular the use of shared resources. Taking resource availability into account during reverse engineering may allow for closer approximation of the cellular environment and points to a potential opportunity for network characterization strategies."
1521561,21246,9475,Data reconciliation of an open channel flow network using modal decomposition,2008,"This article presents a method to estimate flow variables for an open channel network governed by the linearized Saint-Venant equations and subject to periodic forcing. The discharge at the upstream end of the system and the stage at the downstream end of the system are defined as the model input; the flow properties at selected internal locations, as well as the other external boundary conditions, are defined as the output. Both inputs and outputs are affected by noise and we use the model to re-estimate this data. A spatially-dependent transfer matrix in the frequency domain is constructed to relate the model input and output using modal decomposition. A data reconciliation technique is used to incorporate the error in the measured data and results in a set of reconciliated external boundary conditions; subsequently, the flow properties at any location in the system can be accurately constructed from the input measurements. The applicability and effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with a case study of the river flow subject to tidal forcing in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California. We used existing USGS sensors placed in the Delta as measurement points, and deploy our own sensors at selected locations to produce data used for the validation. The proposed method gives an accurate estimation of the flow properties at intermediate locations within the channel network."
1529578,21246,9475,Distributed iterative regularization algorithms for monotone Nash games,2010,"In this paper, we consider the development of single-timescale schemes for the distributed computation of Nash equilibria. In general, equilibria associated with convex Nash games over continuous strategy sets are wholly captured by the solution set of a variational inequality. Our focus is on Nash games whose equilibrium conditions are given by monotone variational inequalities, a class referred to as monotone Nash games. Unless suitably strong assumptions (such as strong monotonicity) are imposed on the mapping corresponding to the variational inequality, distributed schemes for computing equilibria often require the solution of a sequence of regularized problems, each of which has a unique solution. Such schemes operate on two timescales and are generally harder to implement in online settings. Motivated by this shortcoming, this work focuses on the development of three single timescale iterative regularization schemes that require precisely one projection step at every iteration. The first is an iterative Tikhonov regularization scheme while the second is an analogously constructed iterative proximal-point method. Both schemes are characterized by the property that the regularization/centering parameter are updated after every iteration, rather than when one has an approximate solution to the regularized problem. Finally, a modified form of the proximal-point scheme is also presented where the weight on the proximal term is updated as well."
1147635,21246,9475,"Control, monitoring and reconfiguration of sampled-data hybrid process systems with actuator faults",2011,"This work presents an integrated model-based framework for control, fault detection and control system reconfiguration of hybrid process systems with measurement sampling rate constraints and actuator faults. A family of output feedback controllers are initially synthesized to stabilize each fault-free subsystem with the aid of a dynamic inter-sample model predictor for each mode. The stability properties for each closed-loop subsystem are then analyzed to obtain the maximum allowable sampling period together with an explicit characterization of the fault-free behavior of each mode. Conditions that guarantee asymptotic stability of the overall switched system are also derived and used to examine the interplay between the selection of the sampling period, the model, the controller and observer design parameters, and the dwell time for each mode. To detect actuator faults within a given mode, a time-varying alarm threshold based on the fault-free behavior is obtained and used, and when faults are detected, actuator reconfiguration is performed to maintain closed-loop stability. A key idea of the reconfiguration strategy is to take into account not only the stability properties of the current mode, but also the stabilizing ability and availability of the fall-back actuator configurations for the future modes. The design and implementation of the developed methodology are demonstrated using a hybrid chemical reactor example."
932866,21246,9475,Networked control of spatially distributed processes using an adaptive communication policy,2010,"This work presents a model-based networked control structure with a feedback-based communication policy for spatially distributed processes modeled by highly-dissipative nonlinear PDEs with measurement sensors that transmit their data to the controller/actuators over a resource-constrained wireless sensor network. Initially, a finite-dimensional system that captures the slow dynamics of the PDE is derived and used to design a stabilizing Lyapunov-based nonlinear feedback controller. To reduce the frequency at which sensor measurements are transmitted over the network, a model of the slow subsystem is included in the control system to provide estimates of the slow states of the PDE when communication over the network is suspended. To determine when communication must be reestablished, the evolution of the Lyapunov function is monitored such that if it begins to breach a certain stability threshold at any time, the sensors are prompted to send their data over the network to update the model. Communication is then suspended for as long as the Lyapunov function continues to decay. The underlying idea is to use the Lyapunov stability constraint as the basis for switching on or off the communication between the sensors and the controller. A singular perturbation formulation is used to analyze the implementation of the networked control structure on the infinite-dimensional system. Finally, the results are illustrated through an application to a representative nonlinear diffusion-reaction process."
2134480,21246,9475,Design of H ∞ command and control loops for unmanned aerial vehicles using static output-feedback,2007,"The aim of this paper is to design a helicopter position control system with guaranteed performance that allows tracking control of unmanned aerial vehicle positions - X, Y, Z, and yaw while preserving a structure that is generally accepted in the helicopter control community. The paper presents an approach for designing compensators for shaping the closed-loop inertial positions and yaw step response using H infin  output-feedback design techniques. Simplified conditions are used which only require the solution of two coupled matrix design equations. H infin  framework is utilized to pose the problem of stabilization as an outer position command loop and an inner control loop. Inner loop controls attitude rates along with roll and pitch and provides robustness and structure. This paper thereby presents a design for hover and station-keeping control of UAV helicopters. It is shown that the rotorcraft model can be first loop shaped to achieve desired characteristics about the hover operating condition. A numerically efficient solution algorithm to solve the H infin  coupled design equations for both inner and outer loops is used. A major contribution is that an initial stabilizing gain is not needed. The efficacy of the control law and the disturbance accommodation properties are shown on a rotorcraft design example."
1317003,21246,9475,Autostabilizing airframe articulation: Animal inspired air vehicle control,2012,"The sparse sensing and limited articulation that are characteristic of human-engineered robotic systems contrast dramatically with sensorimotor systems observed in nature. Animals are richly imbued with sensors, have many points of articulation and are heavily over-actuated. In fact, the compliant nature of the body (or Plant) of most animals requires constant control input to the muscles for postural maintenance. In this study, we show how flying insects use a compliant airframe to maintain flight stability via active articulation of the frame. We first derive the equations of motion for a model flying insect, inspired by the hawkmoth, a large fast flying and agile insect. By linearizing the equations of motion about a hovering equilibrium, we demonstrate that abdominal motions are sufficient to stabilize flight on a scale of 50ms. We then tested whether these insects use the abdomen for flight control by first measuring the open-loop transfer function between visual pitch rotations and abdominal movement in a tethered moth preparation. The measured transfer function was consistent with an abdominal control strategy. We then closed the loop and found that moths actively stabilize visual pitch rotations using abdominal motion as the only control input. The behavior was robust to variations in gain and to a variety of visual stimuli. These experiments establish airframe articulation as a plausible control mechanism for active flight."
2704562,21246,20561,Assessing Risk of Gas Shortage in Coupled Gas-Electricity Infrastructures,2016,"Many power systems in the United States and elsewhere are experiencing simultaneous increases of the gas-fired and renewable portions in the generation profile. Both contributions are sufficiently clean to replace retiring generators, which are mainly coal-fired. Moreover, pairing gas and renewables is advantageous because the former is flexible enough to mitigate the exogenous fluctuations of the latter. However, the resulting strong coupling of power systems and gas transmission networks through gas-fired generators also imposes risks. In particular, excessive fuel usage by gas-fired power plants may lead to violation of gas pressure limits and gas supply shortages. To provide a simple tool for assessing these risks, we develop a computational framework that characterizes regions of generator dispatch solutions that maintain gas system feasibility. The proposed algorithmic framework is modular -- built through a coordinated execution of multiple generation scenarios within power and gas simulation modules. Monotone dependence of the gas pipeline pressure on the rates of gas withdrawals allows to establish and certify regions of feasibility/infeasibility in the space of the gas injections. The framework is validated against simulations of a highly detailed benchmark gas-electricity model. We conclude the manuscript with a discussion of possible applications of the results to power system operation procedures and regulatory practices."
825747,21246,9475,Design and implementation of an atomic force microscope with adaptive sliding mode controller for large image scanning,2011,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is an advanced technique which aims to scan a sample through the use of a probe or a tip; however, conventional atomic force microscope system suffers from the limitation of small scanning range, due to the short travelling range of piezoelectric actuation. In this paper, we propose a large measurement- range AFM scanning system which combines both fine positioners of piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuations. While the piezoelectric positioner provides high speed scanning with nanometer resolution, the precision electromagnetic positioner is capable of 1 mm 2  large field positioning with 30 nm rms error. The overall design of the stage consists of 4 pairs of electromagnetic actuator, monolithic serial flexure guidance with compression springs, an eddy current damper, and a commercial xyz piezoelectric positioner. Besides, a stationary compact disk/digital versatile disk pick-up-head (CD/DVD PUH) is used to measure the amplitude of samples. Moreover, an adaptive sliding mode controller based on the analytical modeling is used to overcome the unmodeled system uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, preliminary experiments are presented, demonstrating feasibility of the proposed system."
1184481,21246,9475,Perimeter and boundary flow control for heterogeneous transportation networks,2013,"In this paper, we macroscopically describe the traffic dynamics in heterogeneous transportation networks by utilizing the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for urban networks a widely observed relation between network-wide mean flow and density of vehicles. A generic mathematical model for multi-reservoir networks with well-defined MFDs for each reservoir is presented first. Then, an optimal control methodology is employed for the design of perimeter and boundary flow control strategies that aim at distributing the accumulation in each reservoir as homogeneously as possible, and maintaining the rate of vehicles that are allowed to enter each reservoir around a desired point, while the system's throughput is maximized. Perimeter control occurs at the periphery of the network while boundary control occurs at the inter-transfers between neighborhood reservoirs. Based on this control methodology, control actions may be computed in real-time through a linear multivariable integral feedback regulator (LQI). To this end, the heterogeneous network of Downtown San Francisco is partitioned into three homogeneous reservoirs that exhibit well-defined MFDs. These MFDs are then used to design and compare the proposed LQI regulator with a pre-timed signal control plan and a bang-bang controller. Finally, the impact of the control actions to the network is demonstrated via simulation by the use of the corresponding MFDs and other performance measures."
2687658,21246,9475,Distributed iterative learning control for a team of quadrotors,2016,"The goal of this work is to enable a team of quadrotors to learn how to accurately track a desired trajectory while holding a given formation. We solve this problem in a distributed manner, where each vehicle has only access to the information of its neighbors. The desired trajectory is only available to one (or few) vehicles. We present a distributed iterative learning control (ILC) approach where each vehicle learns from the experience of its own and its neighbors' previous task repetitions, and adapts its feedforward input to improve performance. Existing algorithms are extended in theory to make them more applicable to real-world experiments. In particular, we prove stability for any causal learning function with gains chosen according to a simple scalar condition. Previous proofs were restricted to a specific learning function that only depends on the tracking error derivative (D-type ILC). Our extension provides more degrees of freedom in the ILC design and, as a result, better performance can be achieved. We also show that stability is not affected by a linear dynamic coupling between neighbors. This allows us to use an additional consensus feedback controller to compensate for non-repetitive disturbances. Experiments with two quadrotors attest the effectiveness of the proposed distributed multi-agent ILC approach. This is the first work to show distributed ILC in experiment."
2686166,21246,9475,CoM control for underactuated 2D hopping robots with series-elastic actuation via higher order Partial Feedback Linearization,2015,"In this work we introduce a method for enforcing stance phase trajectories on the center of mass (CoM) for a series-elastic actuated 2D hopping robot with realistic actuator dynamics and underactuation. Building on earlier work, we generate CoM trajectories by abstracting the system to a single point mass moving along a 4th order asymmetric trajectory and analytically solve for the effective ground reaction force vector to indirectly enforce stable trajectories on the body angular acceleration, while maintaining precise ballistic take-off conditions on the CoM. By controlling the CoM directly, we provide solutions that account for the real impact dynamics of the system in order to accurately regulate stride length, and provide a framework that allows for future work in the construction of trajectories to achieve desired results such as stride switching, operation on rough terrain, and disturbance rejection. We utilize Partial Feedback Linearization (PFL) control directly on the CoM position, however due to the series-elastic actuation and compliance in the leg, a classical acceleration-based PFL construction is impossible because of the spring force instantaneously determining the acceleration of the leg of the robot. Therefore we present a solution that constructs PFL control laws about the 4th derivative of the CoM position variables."
1153427,21246,9475,Optimal continuous approximation of basic fractional elements: Theory and applications,2011,"In the last two decades, a boom of fractional calculus applications started in many technical areas including automation and process control. The generalization of integrals and derivatives to arbitrary real order (FO - Fractional Order) simplifies solution of many problems especially in frequency domain. Unfortunately, switching into time domain is always quite difficult due to the necessity to approximate fractional elements by integer-order ones. For this purpose, often a high order zero/pole transfer function is employed. This paper extends the authors' previous work and summarizes the results of numerical optimization of zero/pole positions for two important fractional elements: fractional integro-differential operator and fractional pole. The optimization is done on a limited frequency band up to four decades. The quadratic difference between the frequency response of ideal FO element and its zero/pole approximation was taken as an optimality criterion. It is shown, that the optimization decreases markedly the criterion value compared to traditional methods. The paper main results are provided in a form of analytical functions parametrizing the zero/pole positions dependent on element order. Additionally, prospective applications of presented fractional elements are discussed from both controller synthesis and process modeling point of view."
1243469,21246,9475,Policy improvement for repeated zero-sum games with asymmetric information,2012,"In a repeated zero-sum game, two players repeatedly play the same zero-sum game over several stages. We assume that while both players can observe the actions of the other, only one player knows the actual game, which was randomly selected from a set of possible games according to a known distribution. The dilemma faced by the informed player is how to trade off the short-term reward versus long-term consequence of exploiting information, since exploitation also risks revelation. Classic work by Aumann and Maschler derives the recursive value equation, which quantifies this tradeoff and derives a formula for optimal policies by the informed player. However, using this model for explicit computations can be computationally prohibitive as the number of game stages increases. In this paper, we derive a suboptimal policy based on the concept of policy improvement. The baseline policy is a non-revealing policy, i.e., one that completely ignores superior information. The improved policy, which is implemented in a receding horizon manner, strategizes for the current stage while assuming a non-revealing policy for future stages. We show that the improved policy can be computed by solving a linear program, and the computational complexity of this linear program is constant with respect to the length of the game. We derive bounds on the guaranteed performance of the improved policy and establish that the bounds are tight."
1859231,21246,9475,Observer-based control of discrete-time piecewise affine systems: Exploiting continuity twice,2008,"Output-based feedback control of discrete-time hybrid systems is an important problem, as in practice it is rarely the case that the full state variable is available for feedback. A typical approach for output-based feedback design for linear and smooth nonlinear systems is to use certainty equivalence control, in which an observer and a state feedback controller (using the observer state) are combined. Although for linear systems and some classes of nonlinear systems, separation principles exist to justify this approach, for hybrid systems this is not the case. In this paper, we isolate a class of hybrid systems for which a systematic design procedure for certainty equivalence controllers including a separation principle will be presented. This class consists of discrete-time piecewise-affine (PWA) systems with continuous dynamics. In the design procedure, we will exploit the continuity of the PWA dynamics twice. Firstly, it will be used to establish input-to-state stability (ISS) w.r.t. measurement errors from ISS w.r.t. additive disturbances. This is a crucial step as the latter problem is much easier to tackle than the former. Secondly, continuity will be used in the observer design procedure to obtain a significantly simplified set of LMIs with respect to existing observer design approaches for PWA systems. All the design conditions will be formulated in term of LMIs, which can be solved efficiently, as is also illustrated by a numerical example."
2948154,21246,9475,Tracking capability of stochastic gradient algorithm with constant gain,2016,"The stochastic gradient (SG) method has been widely applied in unconstrained stochastic optimization, and is particularly useful in sequential processing such as online learning. Core SG theories on convergence and asymptotic normality are developed on the basis of a stationary and unique optimizer. However, many real-world applications are often nonstationary in nature. In dynamic control systems and other time-varying problems, the true target parameter and/or the true loss function may drift over time, so there is no convergence per se. When drift occurs, SG with constant gain is often used to keep up with the nonstationary target. Several existing works on the tracking capability of recursive algorithms with a constant gain provide asymptotic stochastic big-O bounds of the tracking error. There are also some finite-iteration error bounds developed under fairly strong assumptions. In contrast, this paper builds a computable tracking error bound for SG, which is useful in both the finite-sample performance and the asymptotic analysis. The case of interest requires the strong convexity of the time-varying loss function, but with a mild restriction imposed on the drift associated with the nonstationary evolution. Our result complements existing big-O bound, and delivers a computable bound for practical use."
1115288,21246,9475,Dynamic network interdiction games with imperfect information and deception,2012,"Network interdiction problems consist of zero-sum games between an attacker and an intelligent network defender, where the attacker seeks to degrade network operations while the defender adapts its operations to counteract the effects of the attacker. This problem has received significant attention in recent years due to its relevance to military problems and network security. In this paper, we study a class of dynamic network interdiction games where the attacker has imperfect knowledge of the network topology, and where the attacker can learn about the topology by monitoring network operations. The network observes the attacker's actions, and can choose to avoid using the observed parts of the network in order to disguise information from the attacker. We pose this problem as a multistage game with nested imperfect information structure, and study the extensive form of this game. This form has special structure that we exploit to develop a novel decomposition algorithm for obtaining recursive solutions to this game. We characterize the payoff function of subgames starting at attacker's information sets as piecewise linear concave functions of the attacker's information state, the beliefs those information sets. We then develop a recursive algorithm based on extensions of partially observed Markov Decision Process algorithms to obtain complete solutions to these multistage games with nested information. The resulting recursive algorithm allows dynamic programming-like solution of dynamic games with partially nested information structure, where signaling between players is possible. We illustrate the algorithm with a simple example."
1096607,21246,9475,Robust economic MPC for a power management scenario with uncertainties,2011,"This paper presents a novel incorporation of probabilistic constraints and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) with economic Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hereby the performance of the controller is robustyfied in the presence of both model and forecast uncertainties. Economic MPC is a receding horizon controller that minimizes an economic objective function and we have previously demonstrated its usage to include a refrigeration system as a controllable power consumer with a portfolio of power generators such that total cost is minimized. The main focus for our work is power management of the refrigeration system. Whereas our previous study was entirely deterministic, models of e.g. supermarket refrigeration systems are uncertain, as are forecasts of outdoor temperatures and electricity demand. The linear program we have formulated does not cope with uncertainties and thus it is, liable to drive an optimal solution to an infeasible or very expensive solution. The main contribution of this paper is the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) formulation of the system models, allowing us to describe and handle model uncertainties in the framework of probabilistic constraints. Our new solution using this setup for robustifying the economic MPC is demonstrated by simulation of a small conceptual example. The scenario is primarily chosen to illustrate the effect of our proposed method in that it can be compared with our previous deterministic simulations."
2081276,21246,9475,A cutting-plane method for Mixed-Logical Semidefinite Programs with an application to multi-vehicle robust path planning,2010,"The usual approach to dealing with Mixed Logical Semidefinite Programs (MLSDPs) is through the “Big-M” or the convex hull reformulation. The Big-M approach is appealing for its ease of modeling, but it leads to weak convex relaxations when used in a Branch & Bound framework. The convex hull reformulation, on the other hand, introduces a significant number of auxiliary variables and constraints and is only applicable if the feasible region consists of several disjunctive bounded polyhedra. This paper aims to circumvent these shortcomings by leveraging on Combinatorial Benders Cuts due to Codato & Fischetti and by constructing linear cuts based on a Farkas Lemma for Semidefinite Programming (SDP) within a Cutting-Plane framework. We employ the resulting Cutting-Plane algorithm in a Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) test application for multi-vehicle robust path planning with obstacle and inter-vehicle collision avoidance, taking into consideration exogenous (eg external wind gusts) and endogenous (eg internal noise in the system gain) uncertainty. We formulate this problem as an MLSDP model using minimax approaches by Lofberg and by El Ghaoui et al. and Big-M formulations due to Richards & How."
724635,21246,9475,A novel LOO based two-stage method for automatic model identification of a class of nonlinear dynamic systems,2013,"This paper investigates the construction of models for a class of nonlinear systems that can be represented by linear in parameter models. This is not a trivial problem, as there are many possible combinations of model terms and exhaustive search is not an option when the number of possible model terms is large. Most existing fast approaches such as orthogonal least squares (OLS), fast recursive algorithm (FRA) and their variants serve the purpose of fast selection. However, these stepwise forward methods are greedy approaches in general and the resultant models are not optimal. Further, they do not control the model complexity (i.e. automatically stop the model selection). The two stage algorithm may improve the compactness of models obtained from forward algorithms, again, it does not determine how many model terms are necessary. Recently, some cross validation based methods have been proposed for automatic model construction, based on leave-one-out (LOO) criteria and OLS or FRA, however the issues related to the forward selection algorithms still exist. Further, LOO based methods are computationally expensive as the model often has to be trained N times (N is the number of samples) for just only one evaluation of the LOO criterion. In this paper, a novel and fast two stage algorithm is proposed for automatic construction of linear in parameter models for a class of nonlinear systems using LOO criterion, overcoming the disadvantages of stepwise model selection algorithms and reducing the computational complexity in applying the LOO criteria. Two numerical examples are presented to confirm its effectiveness."
1827210,21246,9475,Periodic event-triggered control for nonlinear systems,2013,"Event-triggered control (ETC) is a control strategy that is especially suited for applications where communication resources are scarce. By updating and communicating sensor and actuator data only when needed for stability or performance purposes, ETC is capable of reducing the amount of communications, while still retaining a satisfactory closed-loop performance. In this paper, an ETC strategy is proposed by striking a balance between conventional periodic sampled-data control and ETC, leading to so-called periodic event-triggered control (PETC). In PETC, the event-triggering condition is verified periodically and at every sampling time it is decided whether or not to compute and to transmit new measurements and new control signals. The periodic character of the triggering conditions leads to various implementation benefits, including a minimum inter-event time of (at least) the sampling interval of the event-triggering condition. The PETC strategies developed in this paper apply to both static state-feedback and dynamical output-based controllers, as well as to both centralized and decentralized (periodic) event-triggering conditions. To analyze the stability and the  L  2 -gain properties of the resulting PETC systems, three different approaches will be presented based on 1) impulsive systems, 2) piecewise linear systems, and 3) perturbed linear systems. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of each of the three approaches will be discussed and the developed theory will be illustrated using a numerical example."
2088988,21246,9475,"Weighted least-squares, cost density-shaping, stochastic optimal control: A step towards total probabilistic control design",2010,"To date, both moment-based and cumulant-based stochastic control schemes have been proposed to constrain statistics of the random cost functional in the stochastic optimal control formalism. However, existing methodologies do not enable the designer to deliberately shape the probability density function of the random cost according to a pre-specified target density characterized by a finite number of cost statistics. Since the mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis of a variate are strongly associated with the appearance of its density function, a cumulant-based control paradigm that can steer four or more cost cumulants towards nominal target values would be ideal for cost density-shaping objectives. Bearing this idea in mind, we propose a novel weighted least-squares optimization problem of minimizing a weighted sum of squared differences between initial cost cumulants and target initial cost cumulants, for arbitrarily-many terms. The problem is solved using dynamic programming techniques adapted for the cost cumulant-generating equations of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework. The Minimum Weighted Least-Squares, Cost Density-Shaping (MWLS-CDS) optimal controller results and is applied in a building protection problem. It is shown that MWLS-CDS controls can achieve target cost cumulants resultant from a family of 3CC controls to within a 0.5% margin of normalized error."
1241729,21246,9475,Approximating the likelihood of historical airline actions to evaluate airline delay cost functions,2012,"Delay cost functions that quantify the cost of delay to airlines are essential to air traffic management research. Seventeen delay cost functions from previous research are evaluated with airline actions in Airspace Flow Programs. Airlines are assumed to solve a minimum cost perfect matching problem when matching flights to slots. Unobserved aspects of airline costs are accounted for by adding a noise term to the cost functions. The goal of this research is to find the cost function and corresponding noise parameters that maximize the likelihood of airline actions during 32 Airspace Flow Programs in the summer of 2006. A heuristic is developed that finds cost noise parameters that maximize an approximation of the log-likelihood of the airline actions. When applied to sample estimation problem instances generated by solving linear programming problems with known noise parameters, the heuristic can more accurately estimate noise parameters than a simple simulation-based approach. Validation efforts based on synthetic airline action data generated with known delay cost functions and noise parameters demonstrate that the heuristic is in many cases able to correctly identify as most likely the delay cost function that was in fact used to generate the synthetic data. However, the heuristic also under-estimates the magnitude of the cost noise variance on these estimation problem instances. Delay costs that are proportional to the length of delay, but with larger proportionality constants for flights bound for hub airports, maximize the approximation of the log-likelihood of the historical airline actions. The estimated standard deviations of the cost noise, expressed as a fraction of the average assignment cost for the historical matchings, ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 for cost functions that achieved relatively large approximate log-likelihoods."

The model arises in aeroelasticity and comprises the interaction between a clamped von Karman plate a surrounding potential flow of gas. Recent results show that the plate dynamics of the model converge to a global compact attracting set of finite dimension [6]. This result was obtained in the absence of mechanical damping of any type. Here, we incorporate a sufficiently large velocity feedback control applied to the structure to show that the full flow-plate system exhibits strong convergence to a stationary state (when flows are subsonic and a “good” energy identity is available). Our method is based on first showing the desired convergence properties when the plate dynamics exhibit additional regularity. We then show a dichotomy for the plate dynamics: they are either asymptotically regular or the plate velocities decay uniformly exponentially. In the case when no additional plate regularity is available, we utilize an approximation by smooth initial data; this requires propagation of initial regularity on the infinite time horizon. The final result complements results previous obtained (for this model and similar models), as we show that there is a strong convergence for the entire dynamics and that the limiting behavior of the flow-plate system is, in fact, stationary. Physically, this implies that flutter (a non-static end behavior) can be eliminated by a velocity feedback control in subsonic flows."
1053240,21246,9475,A Mean Field Games formulation of network based auction dynamics,2013,"A decentralized quantity allocation problem over networks has been studied in (Jia and Caines, 2013) where two-level network based auction dynamics are formulated so as to achieve efficient resource allocations (in the sense of maximization of social welfare). The adjustment of the quantities provided to any supplier in the higher-level network is facilitated via a cooperative dynamical system which exchanges quantities among the supplier's neighbors based upon the corresponding lower-level buyer auctions' limit prices. This paper considers such a network based auction system with incomplete information and stochastic disturbances. First, in the lower-level networks, assuming that all buyers apply a so-called Mean Field Games (MFG) strategy, efficient allocation is achieved rapidly when the distribution of the demand functions is known to each buyer. Second, in the higher-level network, suppliers are associated with a stochastic dynamical system with inputs (i.e., the local auctions' limit prices) and outputs determining their quantity exchange rate. We analyze this stochastic dynamical game within the MFG control framework. We show that the set of MFG control laws has an ∈-Nash equilibrium property where ∈ goes to zero as the supplier population size goes to infinity; moreover, a weighted average consensus on quantities is reached asymptotically with all local limit prices being equal in the lower-level networks, i.e., efficient quantity allocation is achieved asymptotically. A potential application of this work is to small cell communication networks."
1222223,21246,9475,DFK control design for nonlinear systems,2012,"We propose an approach for the direct design from data of controllers finalized at solving tracking problems for nonlinear systems. This approach, called Direct FeedbacK (DFK) design, overcomes relevant problems typical of the standard design methods, such as modeling errors, non-trivial parameter identification, non-convex optimization, and difficulty in nonlinear control design. Considering a Set Membership (SM) setting, we provide two main contributions. The first one is a theoretical framework for the stability analysis of nonlinear feedback control systems, in which the controller ̂f is an approximation identified from data of an ideal inverse model f o . In this framework, we derive sufficient conditions under which ̂f stabilizes the closed-loop system. The second contribution is a technique for the direct design of an approximate controller f* from data, having suitable optimality and sparsity properties. In particular, we show that f* is an almost-optimal controller (in a worst-case sense), and we derive a guaranteed accuracy bound, which can be used to quantify the performance level of the DFK control system. The technique is based on convex optimization and sparse identification methods, and thus avoids the problem of local minima and allows an efficient on-line controller implementation in real-world applications."
2308572,21246,9475,A new approach to optimal filter design for nonlinear systems,2009,"Optimal filters for nonlinear systems are in general difficult to derive/implement. The common approach is to obtain approximate solutions, e.g. based on linearizations along the performed path, as done in Extended Kalman Filters. However, no optimality properties can be guaranteed using these approximations, not even the stability of the estimation error is ensured. In this paper, a new method is presented, able to overcome this problem. The method is based on the direct identification of the filter from a set of data. Under the standard assumptions of the filtering literature, i.e. known system and noise properties, the data can be generated by simulations of system equations. A further feature of the method arises from the fact that, in most practical situations, the system to filter is not known, but it is possible to perform measurements on it. In these situations, a two-step approach is typically adopted: 1) a model of the system is identified from the available measurements; 2) a filter is designed from the identified model. A relevant problem of the two-step design is that, in presence of modeling errors, the two-step filter may display large performance deteriorations. The direct method allows the direct design of the filter from the measurements, avoiding this problem. The method is developed within a Set Membership framework. Optimal filters for nonlinear systems are obtained, where optimality refers to the minimization of the induced norm from the noise to the estimation error."
1868626,21246,9475,Modeling and model predictive control of hemodynamic variables during hemodialysis,2010,"Fluid removal during hemodialysis leads to relative hypovolemia that may cause hemodynamic instability in end-stage renal failure patients. To maintain the hemodynamic stability of patients, this paper proposes a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system based model predictive control (MPC) approach to regulate the hemodynamic variables during hemodialysis. The system uses ultrafiltration rate (UFR) as the control input and tracks the changes in relative blood volume (RBV) and percentage change in heart rate (ΔHR(%)) during hemodialysis while maintaining the UFR as well as the percentage change in systolic blood pressure (ΔSBP(%)) within certain bounds. MPC based approach is utilized to account for system variability and to explicitly handle the constraints on the control input as well as the system output. To model the hemodynamic variables, multiple LPV systems are introduced. The control algorithm tracks the changes in RBV and ΔHR to follow reference trajectories. The system parameters are updated at each control interval to get the best fitting into the parameterized model. The simulation results show that while keeping the control input as well as the output within a practically realizable bounds, the system is able to regulate RBV and ΔHR to pre-defined trajectories as well as maintaining ΔSBP within bounds by adjusting the UFR. Such systems can help to ensure the stability of patient undergoing hemodialysis by avoiding sudden change in hemodynamic variables."
2037770,21246,9475,A fast automatic construction algorithm for kernel fisher discriminant classifiers,2010,"Nonlinear Fisher Discriminant Analysis for binomial problems can be converted into a Linear-In-The-Parameters classifier model by introducing a least-squares cost function. However, the complexity of the classifier scales with the number of training samples, which makes it difficult to use on large data sets. A popular solution is to adopt a sub-model selection approach, such as Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) or the Fast Recursive Algorithm (FRA), to produce a compact classifier with accurate parameters. The problem is that these methods need additional subjective choice of selection termination criterion, and inappropriate choice of this criterion may lead to an over-fitting classifier. Further, training data with large noise may even deteriorate the performance. This paper proposes a fast automatic forward algorithm for constructing a parsimonious descriptor of the nonlinear discriminant function, thus both the subjective choice of the termination criterion and the over-fitting problem due to noisy data can be avoided. This is achieved by an effective integration of the Bayesian regularisation technique, the Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation criterion and the FRA algorithm. Experimental results are included to confirm the efficacy and superiority of the proposed algorithm on both artificial and real world data sets."
2701011,21246,9475,Perspectives of orthonormal basis functions based kernels in Bayesian system identification,2015,"Kernel-based regularization approaches for linear time-invariant system identification have been introduced recently. This class of methods corresponds to a particular regularized least-squares methodology that may achieve a favorable bias/variance trade-off compared with classical Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) methods. However, to fully exploit this property, the kernel function itself needs to be appropriately designed for the identification problem at hand to be able to successfully capture all relevant aspects of the data-generating system. Hence, there is a need for a methodology that can accomplish this design step without affecting the simplicity of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a systematic kernel construction mechanism to capture dynamic system behavior via the use of orthonormal basis functions (OBFs). Two special cases are investigated as an illustration of the construction mechanism, namely Laguerre and Kautz based kernel structures. Monte-Carlo simulations show that OBFs-based kernels with Laguerre basis perform well compared with stable spline/TC kernels, especially for slow systems with dominant poles close to the unit circle. Moreover, the capability of Kautz basis to model resonant systems is also shown."
1004092,21246,9475,On global solution to a class of smart building-grid energy management models,2012,"This paper presents a convex relaxation of a class of smart building-grid energy management models using a semi-definite programming approach. A smart building-grid energy system is roughly defined as an interconnection of buildings and electric power grid energy resources within a clearly defined boundary, here called a smart site. A smart site is a strategic or self-interested entity that seeks to maximize some utility function subject to all applicable technical and budget constraints. The utility function is here a measure of energy efficiency. A smart site may purchase energy from or sell energy to its external environment. On one hand, traditional building energy management systems have focused on meeting the energy requirements of one or more buildings assuming that the buildings are connected to a strong or infinite-capacity utility grid. On the other hand, electric grid management systems have traditionally modeled relatively large sites as single grid nodes with simple lump load models. The contribution of the present paper is two-fold: to provide a general model that integrates and extends building and energy management models, and (b) to develop a convex relaxation of the ensuing model a solution of which yields a global lower bound. The proposed approach also provides a means to test whether any solution, for example, obtained using a heuristic method, is global, and the corresponding optimality gap."
2335059,21246,9475,Synthesis of Inference-based Decentralized Control for Discrete Event Systems,2006,"In our past work, we presented a framework for the decentralized control of discrete event systems involving inferencing over ambiguities, about the system state, of various local decision makers. Using the knowledge of the self-ambiguity and those of the others, each local control decision is tagged with a certain ambiguity level (level zero being the minimum and representing no ambiguity). A global control decision is taken to be a winning local control decision, i.e., one with a minimum ambiguity level. For the existence of a decentralized supervisor, so that for each controllable event the ambiguity levels of all winning disablement or enablement decisions are bounded by some number N (such a supervisor is termed N-inferring), the notion of N- inference-observability was introduced. When the given specification fails to satisfy the iV-inference-observability property, an iV-inferring supervisor achieving the entire specification does not exist. We first show that the class of iV-inference-observable sublanguages is not closed under union implying that the supremal N- inference-observable sublanguage need not exist. We next provide a technique for synthesizing an N -inferring decentralized supervisor that achieves an N -inference-observable sublanguage of the specification. The sublanguage achieved equals the specification language when the specification itself is iV-inference-observable. A formula for the synthesized sublanguage is also presented. For the special cases of N = 0 and N = 1, the proposed supervisor achieves the same language as those reported in [25], [31] (for N = 0) and [32] (for N = 1). The synthesized supervisor is parameterized by N (the parameter bounding the ambiguity level), and as N is increased, the supervisor becomes strictly more permissive in general. Thus, a user can choose N based on the degree of permissiveness and the degree of computational complexity desired."
1542161,21246,9475,Fundamentals of economic model predictive control,2012,"The goal of most current advanced control systems is to guide a process to a target setpoint rapidly and reliably. Model predictive control has become a popular technology in many applications because it can handle large, multivariable systems subject to hard constraints on states and inputs. The optimal steady-state setpoint is usually provided by some other information management system that determines, among all steady states, which is the most profitable. For an increasing number of applications, however, this hierarchical separation of information and purpose is no longer optimal or desirable. A recently proposed alternative to the hierarchical decomposition is to take the economic objective directly as the objective function of the control system. In this approach, known as economic MPC, the controller optimizes directly in real time the economic performance of the process, rather than tracking to a setpoint. The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to design these kinds of control systems and what kinds of closed-loop properties one can achieve with them. We cover the following issues: asymptotic average performance; closed-loop stability and convergence, strong duality and dissipativity; designing terminal costs, terminal regions, and terminal periodic constraints. Several examples are included to illustrate these results."
1732263,21246,9475,Fold-change detection as a chemotaxis model discrimination tool,2012,"Fold-change detection (FCD) is the property that a dynamical system with an adapting output will exhibit identical transient output responses when its input signals are scaled. This feature was recently demonstrated in the chemotactic response of the bacterium Escherichia coli, confirming earlier theoretical predictions. The chemotaxis pathway of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has the same modular structure as that in E. coli but is significantly more complex in that it has multiple homologues of the latter's chemotaxis proteins and features two, rather than one, chemosensory cluster. Recent experimental results suggest that R. sphaeroides may also exhibit FCD. In this paper, we present a set of theoretical assumptions on the dynamics of the R. sphaeroides chemosensory system, and use these to fit an integrated chemotaxis model to experimental data. We then show that the assumptions we place are sufficient to make FCD a robust property of this chemotaxis pathway, in agreement with preliminary experimental evidence. We argue that the fact that the model we present here is able to reproduce this transient dynamic property whilst earlier models cannot makes FCD a useful tool for model discrimination on the basis of transient dynamic response. This is in contrast to earlier model discrimination methods which tested the validity of models based on their ability to reproduce a finite set of experimental data. Further experiments that can provide additional validation of our theoretical assumptions are suggested."
2034385,21246,9475,Vector dither experiment design and direct parametric identification of reversed-field pinch normal modes,2009,"Magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) research ambitiously endeavours to develop a major future energy source. MCF power plant designs, typically some variation on the tokamak, unfortunately suffer from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. One unstable mode is known as the resistive-wall mode (RWM) which is a macroscopically global type of perturbation that can degrade or even terminate the plasma in the reactor if not stabilized. In this work the topic of RWMs is studied for the reversed-field pinch (RFP), another toroidal MCF concept, similar to the tokamak. The problem of identifying RWM dynamics during closed-loop operation is tackled by letting physics-based parametric modeling join forces with convex programming experiment design. An established MHD normal modes description is assessed for the RFP by synthesizing a multivariable dither signal where spatial fourier modes are spectrally shaped, with regard to real experiment constraints, to yield minimum variance parameter estimates in the prediction-error framework. The dithering is applied to the real RFP plant EXTRAP-T2R, and experimental MHD spectra are obtained by an automated procedure."
2968764,21246,9475,Error bounds on the DC power flow approximation: A convex relaxation approach,2016,"Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under “normal” operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are “small”. However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions."
2358132,21246,9475,Identification of the magneto-thermal plasma response for plasma state control in advanced tokamaks,2009,"The paper deals with the basic elements of an integrated model-based control strategy for extrapolating present-day advanced tokamak scenarios to steady state operation. Taking advantage of the large ratio between the time scales involved in the magnetic and thermal diffusion processes, the model identification procedure makes use of a multiple time scale approximation. The methodology is generic and can be applied to any device, with different sets of heating and current drive actuators, controlled variables and/or parameter profiles. It has been applied to experimental data from JET and JT-60U, and satisfactory models have been obtained. A profile controller can then be articulated around two composite feedback loops operating on the resistive and confinement time scales, respectively. The controller aims to use the combination of H&CD systems in an optimal way to regulate the evolution of the magneto-thermal state of the plasma. First experimental results obtained with three H&CD actuators to control the safety factor profile on JET are displayed. Simultaneous real-time control of the q-profile and toroidal velocity profile on JT-60U, using four groups of neutral beam injectors, has been simulated and typical results are presented."
1280450,21246,9475,Robust control of large vehicular platoons with prescribed transient and steady state performance,2014,"In this paper, we consider the longitudinal control problem for a platoon of vehicles with unknown nonlinear dynamics. More specifically, we design a decentralized model-free control protocol in the sense that each vehicle utilizes only local relative information regarding its front vehicle, obtained by its on-board sensors, to calculate its own control signal, without incorporating any prior knowledge of the model nonlinearities/disturbances or any approximation structures to acquire such knowledge. Additionally, the transient and steady state response is a priori determined by certain designer-specified performance functions and is fully decoupled by the agents' dynamic model, the number of vehicles composing the platoon and the control gains selection, which relaxes significantly the control design procedure. Moreover, introducing certain inter-vehicular distance constraints during the transient response shaping, collisions between successive vehicles as well as connectivity breaks owing to limited sensing capabilities are provably avoided. Finally, the proposed methodology results in a low complexity design. Actually, it is a static scheme involving very few and simple calculations to output the control signal, thus making its distributed implementation straightforward."
2681073,21246,9475,Load frequency control of a microgrid based on H∞ control considering response speed of generators,2015,"In this paper, we discuss the load-frequency control problem of microgrids. Control is applied to maintain a balance between electric-power demand and supply by controlling the outputs of generators in power systems. However, because of the large-scale introduction of energy from renewable-energy sources, it has become more difficult to maintain this balance. To solve this problem, we consider two approaches in this study. First, we use dispersion-type power sources such as batteries, and secondly, we apply new control theories. Therefore, we focus on a microgrid that comprises a wind-turbine generator, a diesel generator, and a battery, and we propose a technique based on static H∞ control. First, we design a generalized plant considering the differences in the response speeds of diesel generators and batteries. Then, we apply static H∞ control to the generalized plant. Moreover, we combine a linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition with static H∞ control to avoid control gains that will result in control inputs that are too large. We perform numerical simulations to verify that the controller can suppress the frequency deviations and deviations in the residual capacity of the battery. Furthermore, we show that the approach can be employed to design controllers with lower dimensions, and to avoid undesirable control gains. Finally, we perform experiments using a generator and a variable resistance to confirm the effectiveness of the controller."
2383092,21246,9475,Reduced-order modeling of aggregated thermostatic loads with demand response,2012,"Demand Response is playing an increasingly important role in smart grid control strategies. Modeling the dynamical behavior of a large population of appliances under demand response is especially important to evaluate the effectiveness of various demand response programs. In this paper an aggregate model is proposed for a class of second-order Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs). The model efficiently includes statistical information of the population, systematically deals with heterogeneity, and accounts for a second-order effect necessary to accurately capture the transient dynamics in the collective response. A good performance of the model however requires a high state dimension which dramatically complicates its formal analysis and controller design. To address this issue, a model reduction approach is developed for the proposed aggre-gate model, which can significantly reduce its complexity with small performance loss. The original and the reduced-order aggregate models are validated against simulations of thousands of detailed building models using GridLAB-D (an open-source distribution simulation software). The results indicate that the reduced-order model can accurately reproduce the steady-state and transient dynamics generated by GridLAB-D simulations with a much reduced complexity."
1881754,21246,9475,"Important moments in systems, control and optimization",2009,"The moment problem matured from its various special forms in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries to a general class of problems that continues to exert profound influence on the development of analysis and its applications to a wide variety of fields. In particular, the theory of systems and control is no exception, where the applications have historically been to circuit theory, optimal control, robust control, signal processing, spectral estimation, stochastic realization theory and the use of the moments of a probability density. Many of these applications are also still works in progress. In this paper, we consider the generalized moment problem, expressed in terms of a basis of a finite-dimensional subspace P of the Banach space C[a, b] and a “positive” sequences c, but with a new wrinkle inspired by the applications to systems and control. We seek to parameterize solutions which are positive “rational” measures, in a suitably generalized sense. Our parameterization is given in terms of smooth objects. In particular, the desired solution space arises naturally as a manifold which can be shown to be diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space and which is the domain of some canonically defined functions. Moreover, on these spaces one can derive natural convex optimization criteria which characterize solutions to this new class of moment problems."
1513539,21246,9475,An alternative modeling and controller design guaranteeing power stability for DFIG wind systems,2013,"Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) are widely used in wind power systems due to their inherent capability of controlling the produced active and reactive power at desired levels, in a large range of wind speeds. In this paper, a nonconventional modeling approach of a DFIG wind system is introduced that permits to control directly the active and reactive power produced. To this end, first, the complete nonlinear dynamic model that contains as states the stator active and reactive power is extracted in the synchronously rotating dq reference frame. Assuming operation under grid voltage reference frame orientation, it is easily shown that the stator power components can be controlled separately through the d- and q-axis rotor voltage inputs. Hence, unlike the complex conventional cascaded controller designs for DFIGs, in this paper, a simple design of proportional controllers for the stator power components is adopted. For this scheme an advanced, Lyapunov-based, stability analysis is conducted that guarantees stable operation and convergence to the equilibrium. This closed-loop scheme is further completed by an outer PI controller design that tracks the rotor speed to the optimum, providing the active power reference for the maximum power point operation. Finally, the analysis and the performance of the closed-loop DFIG wind system are verified through simulation results."
2693724,21246,9475,Linear-quadratic stochastic differential Stackelberg games with a high population of followers,2015,"We consider a class of stochastic differential games with the Stackelberg mode of play, with one leader and N uniform followers (where N is sufficiently large), where each player has its own local controlled dynamics and quadratic cost function, with the coupling between the players being through the cost functions. Particularly, the leader's cost function has as input the average value of the states of the followers, and each follower's cost function has a similar term in addition to being directly affected by the control function of the leader; thus, the leader controls the behavior of the followers (who play a Nash game) through his control strategy. As such, this class of stochastic differential games is quite difficult to analyze and obtain the Stackelberg-Nash solution of. To circumvent this difficulty, our approach in this paper is to imbed the original game in a class of mean-field stochastic differential games, where the followers solve individual stochastic control problems given the mean field behavior of their average states and with leader's control taken as an exogenous stochastic process. We show that for each fixed policy of the leader, the followers' optimal decentralized local policies lead to an ∈-Nash equilibrium, where ∈ = O(1/√N). The paper then solves the leader's optimal control problem, as a constrained optimization problem, with the constraint being induced by the ∈-Nash equilibrium policies of the followers (which depend on the leaders control as an exogenous process). We obtain the leaders optimal decentralized local control, which we subsequently show to constitute an O(1/√N)-approximate Stackelberg equilibrium for the original game. A numerical example included in the paper illustrates the theoretical results."

Keeping the blood glucose level between certain thresholds is essential for the proper energy transport. Insulin plays a key role in maintaining the glucose homeostasis. Because of its great importance, many models were published on either to describe the glucose-insulin interaction in case of patients under Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or to model Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Currently for most of the models linear control concepts are used in order to design an appropriate controller. The aim of the current paper is to investigate applicability of nonlinear control theory providing exact mathematical background in the control problem of glucose-insulin interaction. Both ICU and T1DM cases are analyzed on well-known models with different complexity. Our aim is to hide the nonlinearity of the models by transforming the input signal so that the response of the model would mimic the behavior of a linear system; hence extending the validity of linear controllers. The asymptotic tracking problem needs the value of the state variables; therefore extended Kalman-filter is applied. The capabilities of this approach are examined through classical control algorithms and input data recorded in clinical environment."
2701032,21246,9475,Analysis and use of several generalized ℋ(∞ mixed sensitivity frameworks for stable multivariable plants subject to simultaneous output and input loop breaking specifications,2015,"In this paper, we present and examine three generalized mixed-sensitivity control design frameworks for linear time invariant (LTI) plants for trading off properties at distinct multivariable loop-breaking points, while being able to handle a broad class of closed loop (e.g. ℋ(∞, ℋ2, frequency- and time domain) specifications. Multiobjective tradeoff paradigms are developed and analysed for ill-conditioned plants having large relative gain array entries - plants that have received considerable attention in the literature without yielding a direct systematic design methodology. We provide insight into the effectiveness of each approach and discuss the trading-off of properties at distinct loop-breaking points. This is done by exploiting the Youla-Jabr-Bongiorno-Kucera-Zames (YJBKZ) parameterization, the resulting convexification, and efficient state-of-the-art convex solvers that can be applied to smooth as well as non-differentiable problems. Moreover, we also show how our approach can be applied to multivariable infinite-dimensional plants. Specifically, by using finite dimensional approximants that converge in the uniform topology, we obtain near-optimal finite dimensional controllers for the infinite dimensional plant. Illustrative examples are provided for a thermal PDE and a retarded time delay system."

With increasing prices of energy and specific customer demands employing effective product scheduling strategies has become essential for manufacturing industries to maintain their business viability. In this paper, a new product scheduling method is proposed for multi-machine, multi-product flow lines. The objective here is to control the production start time for each grade so that the product delivery time errors are minimised. It is also desired to minimise the overall makespan variability caused by non-Gaussian uncertainties formulated by the entropy of the delivery time errors. Therefore, the proposed product scheduling strategy is a nonlinear multi-objective optimisation problem with non-Gaussian uncertainties. To solve this problem, the nonlinear dynamic flow line model is converted to a linear dynamic equivalent using a (Max,+) algebraic approach. Then, a Proportional-Integral (PI) scheduling controller is used to control the production start time for each grade. The scheduling controller coefficients are tuned by a Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique and a comparison is made between MODE, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)."
454786,21246,9475,Optimal Power Flow with Weighted chance constraints and general policies for generation control,2015,"Due to the increasing amount of electricity generated from renewable sources, uncertainty in power system operation will grow. This has implications for tools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in power system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for this uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance Constrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation to a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are not immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for generation control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On the other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between large and small violations, although those might carry significantly different risk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle general control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient computation. The weighted chance constraints account for the size of violations through a weighting function, which assigns a higher risk to a higher overloads. We prove that the problem remains convex for any convex weighting function, and for very general generation control policies. In a case study, we compare the performance of the new WCC-OPF and the standard CC-OPF and demonstrate that WCC-OPF effectively reduces the number of severe overloads. Furthermore, we compare an affine generation control policy with a more general policy, and show that the additional flexibility allow for a lower cost while maintaining the same level of risk."
1592671,21246,9475,Iterative computation of polyhedral invariants sets for polynomial dynamical systems,2014,"This paper deals with the computation of polyhedral positive invariant sets for polynomial dynamical systems. A positive invariant set is a subset of the state-space such that if the initial state of the system belongs to this set, then the state of the system remains inside the set for all future time instances. In this work, we present a procedure that constructs an invariant set, iteratively, starting from an initial polyhedron that forms a “guess” at the invariant. At each iterative step, our procedure attempts to prove that the given polyhedron is a positive invariant by setting up a non-linear optimization problem for each facet of the current polyhedron. This is relaxed to a linear program through the use of the blossoming principle for polynomials. If the current iterate fails to be invariant, we attempt to use local sensitivity analysis using the primal-dual solutions of the linear program to push its faces outwards/inwards in a bid to make it invariant. Doing so, however, keeps the face normals of the iterates fixed for all steps. In this paper, we generalize the process to vary the normal vectors as well as the offsets for the individual faces. Doing so, makes the procedure completely general, but at the same time increases its complexity. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the new approach allows our procedure to recover from a poor choice of templates initially to yield better invariants."
2711726,21246,9475,Data center optimal regulation service reserve provision with explicit modeling of quality of service dynamics,2015,"Data centers have shown great opportunities to participate in extensive demand response programs in recently years. This paper specifically focuses on data centers as participants in regulation service reserves (RSR) power market. We propose a novel approach to model the dynamics of the job processing Quality of Service (QoS) in data centers that offer RSR, and use stochastic dynamic programming (DP) to solve for the optimal reserve deployment policies. We show that the job QoS degradation can be modeled as a time varying probability distribution function (PDF) whose mean and variance evolve as functions of recent control statistics. The mean and variance are in fact additional state variables or sufficient statistics of the stochastic DP whose solution provides the data center operator (DCO) decision supports to minimize the average operating costs associated with RSR signal tracking error and job processing QoS degradation. Simulation results show that the feedback control policy obtained from the stochastic DP solution can reduce the DCO's operating costs compared to heuristic operating protocols reported in the literature. In addition, the DP value function can assist the DCO to bid optimally into the hour-ahead joint energy and reserve market."
2009701,21246,9475,Model-on-Demand predictive control for nonlinear hybrid systems with application to adaptive behavioral interventions,2010,"This paper presents a data-centric modeling and predictive control approach for nonlinear hybrid systems. System identification of hybrid systems represents a challenging problem because model parameters depend on the mode or operating point of the system. The proposed algorithm applies Model-on-Demand (MoD) estimation to generate a local linear approximation of the nonlinear hybrid system at each time step, using a small subset of data selected by an adaptive bandwidth selector. The appeal of the MoD approach lies in the fact that model parameters are estimated based on a current operating point; hence estimation of locations or modes governed by autonomous discrete events is achieved automatically. The local MoD model is then converted into a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system representation which can be used directly in a model predictive control (MPC) law for hybrid systems using multiple-degree-of-freedom tuning. The effectiveness of the proposed MoD predictive control algorithm for nonlinear hybrid systems is demonstrated on a hypothetical adaptive behavioral intervention problem inspired by Fast Track, a real-life preventive intervention for improving parental function and reducing conduct disorder in at-risk children. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be useful for adaptive intervention problems exhibiting both nonlinear and hybrid character."
922305,21246,9475,On the convergence of joint schemes for online computation and supervised learning,2012,"Traditionally, the field of deterministic optimization has been devoted to minimization of functions f(x; θ*) whose parameters, denoted by θ*, are known with certainty. Supervised learning theory on the other hand considers the question of employing training data to seek a function from a set of possible functions. Instances of learning algorithms include regression schemes and support vector machines, amongst others. We consider a hybrid problem of computation and learning that arises in online settings, where one may be interested in optimizing f(x; θ*) while learning θ* through a set of observations. More generally, we consider the solution of parameterized monotone variational inequality problems, which can capture a range of convex optimization problems and convex Nash games. The unknown parameter θ* is learned through the noisy observations of a linear function of θ*, denoted by l(x; θ*). This paper provides convergence statements for joint schemes when observations are corrupted by noise in regimes where the associated variational inequality problem may be either strongly monotone or merely monotone. The proposed schemes are shown to produce iterates that converge in mean to their true counterparts. Numerical results derived from the application of these techniques to convex optimization problems and nonlinear Nash-Cournot games is shown to be promising."
2078618,21246,9475,Multi-valued robust control technique for uncertain systems,2008,"A variety of plants with high parametric uncertainties are usually controlled with signals that may assume only a finite number of values, both to simplify actuator's construction and minimize the operation cost. The design of multi-valued control laws which provide a control signal that is discontinuous in time and quantized in magnitude is then of particular interest in many practical applications. This paper presents a new technique for robust control design in order to force a SISO linear plant, subject to disturbances and parametric uncertainties, to track a given sufficiently regular reference trajectory. The proposed approach is based on Lyapunov method and allows designing a control law which guarantees to follow the reference trajectory with prefixed values of the tracking error and of its derivatives up to the n1-th, where n is the order of the plant. Moreover, the control law is quite robust and guarantees the convergence of the error in a prefixed time. The technique is applied to design controllers characterized by control signals that may assume only a finite number of values. In this case, the control law can be seen as a generalization of the traditional relay control laws and of the sliding mode ones, with a relatively low switching frequency. Finally, a simple example shows the advantages of the control law obtained with the proposed design methodology with respect to the classical approaches."
1157770,21246,8441,Path following of marine surface vessels with saturated transverse actuators,2013,"This paper presents a control technique for low speed path following applications of fully actuated marine surface vehicles with saturated transverse actuators. Path following of straight lines is considered. The control system is designed to counteract disturbances caused by ocean currents and combines the Integral Line-of-Sight guidance law (ILOS) with a nonlinear saturated sway controller. The ocean current is considered constant, irrotational and acting in any direction of the inertial frame. The control configuration is derived from controllers designed for underactuated marine vehicles and exploits both sway actuators and side-slipping to compensate for the drift and guarantee successful path following. The additional use of transverse actuators for disturbance compensation increases mission flexibility when trade-offs between path following speed, power usage and energy consumption arise. This represents an extension of the underactuated case. The vehicle dynamics are defined in terms of relative velocities only, since the ocean current is assumed irrotational. Closed loop uniform global asymptotic stability and uniform local exponential stability are achieved and explicit bounds on the guidance law parameters are given. The theoretical results are supported by simulations."
1950049,21246,9475,Sensor scheduling for energy constrained estimation in multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks,2010,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) enable a wealth of new applications where remote estimation is essential. Individual sensors simultaneously sense a dynamic process and transmit measured information over a shared channel to a central fusion center. The fusion center computes an estimate of the process state by means of a Kalman filter. In this paper we assume that the WSN admits a tree topology with fusion center at the root node. At each time step only a subset of sensors can be selected to transmit their observations to the fusion center due to limited energy budget. We propose a stochastic sensor selection algorithm to randomly select a subset of sensors according to certain probability distribution, which is chosen to minimize the expected next step estimation error covariance matrix while maintaining the connectivity of the network. One of the main advantages of the stochastic formulation over the traditional deterministic formulation is that the stochastic formulation provides smaller expected estimation error than the deterministic formulation. Further, we prove that the optimal stochastic sensor selection problem can be relaxed into a convex optimization problem and thus solved efficiently. We also provide a possible implementation of our algorithm which does not introduce any communication overhead. Finally a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
2139984,21246,9475,Control circuitry for fear conditioning associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),2010,"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder triggered by exposure to traumatic stressors. At a molecular level, traumatic stress triggers the release of neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), and the corresponding receptors take the role of sensors that signals the fear conditioning (FD) circuit. The proteins in the FD neuronal circuit in turn activate the transcription factor CREB in amygdala and Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) to counteract the stress in order to maintain the homeostasis of the system. However, a sustained excessive CREB level due to high stress results in long-lasting fear memory and social avoidance, typical symptoms of PTSD. Therefore, we hypothesize that an excessive production of CREB through the DA-CREB pathway may be one of the causes that lead to PTSD. In order to validate this hypothesis, we construct a chemical kinetic model of DA-CREB pathway in the FD circuit and subject it to both sensitivity and bifurcation analysis. Sensitivity analysis revealed a core positive feedback loop in the FD circuit that is responsible for sustained production of CREB under stressful conditions, and consistent with this analysis, bifurcation analysis also revealed the importance of this feedback loop by exhibiting bistability that causes several proteins in the FD circuit to sustain a high concentration level and attains a difficult to recovery state. This preliminary study underlines the importance of DA-CREB regulatory pathway, which when disrupted due to traumatic stress leads to PTSD symptoms."
2903963,21246,9475,A non-conservative robust output feedback MPC for constrained linear systems,2016,"Model predictive control is an advanced control strategy with a large number of applications. The ability to handle multi-variable problems easily while satisfying input and state constraints make this approach highly appealing. However, when uncertainties are present, a robust scheme is required to ensure stability and satisfaction of constraints. Robustness however should not lead to a drastic deterioration of the performance in the nominal case. One kind of uncertainties that require a robust behavior are disturbances and uncertain model parameters, another uncertain influence comes from measurement errors and state estimation. While most MPC approaches assume that exact state information is available at every time step in the MPC formulation, this is not realistic. Normally not all the states are measured and the measurements are corrupted by noise. Because of the presence of constraints, the separation principle does not hold even in the case of linear systems and hence an output feedback scheme needs to be devised such that the estimation error is accounted for in addition to plant-model mismatch and disturbances. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a non-conservative output feedback scheme within the multi-stage MPC framework for linear time-invariant systems."
2013075,21246,9475,Underwater glider motion control,2008,"This paper describes an underwater glider motion control system intended to enhance locomotive efficiency by reducing the energy expended by vehicle guidance. In previous work, the authors derived an approximate analytical expression for steady turning motion by applying regular perturbation theory to a realistic vehicle model. The analysis results suggested the use of a well-known time-optimal path planning procedure developed for the Dubins car, an often-used model of a wheeled mobile robot. For underwater gliders operating at their most efficient flight condition, time-optimal glide paths correspond to energy-optimal glide paths. Thus, an analytically informed strategy for energy-efficient locomotion is to generate sequences of steady wings-level and turning motions according to the Dubins path planning procedure. Because the turning motion results are only approximate, however, and to compensate for model and environmental uncertainty, one must incorporate feedback to ensure convergent path following. This paper describes the dynamic modelling of the complete multi-body control system and the development and numerical implementation of a motion control system. The control system can be combined with a higher level guidance strategy involving Dubins-like paths to achieve energy-efficient locomotion."
1129306,21246,9475,Underwater inertial navigation with long base line transceivers: A Near-Real-Time approach,2013,"Due to the short range over which electromagnetic fields decay in sea water, inertial navigation systems for underwater vehicles are often aided by acoustic time-of-flight positioning scheme. One widely implemented long-baseline (LBL) approach uses a ping-response protocol resulting in asynchronous measurements that depend on the state of the vehicle at two time instants. Due to these issues, the standard assumptions necessary for Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) solutions are not satisfied. This paper proposes a Near-Real-Time (NRT) Bayesian smoothing framework for the LBL aided INS application. Within this NRT framework, the navigation process is divided into the ping-response cycles of LBL transceiving. Before the end of a LBL cycle, a traditional realtime EKF is implemented using the IMU and standard aiding measurements. At the end of each LBL cycle, an optimal Bayesian trajectory estimator executes. This Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) estimation includes all the measurement information collected during the current LBL cycle. Furthermore, right after this smoothing process, the current EKF estimate is corrected by the corresponding MAP estimate. This article presents the theoretical solution, discusses the implementation, and presents simulation results to illustrate the accuracy and reliability of this Near-Real-Time approach."
2301292,21246,9475,Mode Detection in switched pursuit tracking tasks: Hybrid estimation to measure performance in Parkinson's disease,2010,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs motor skills, speech, and other voluntary movement, and may be associated with cognitive inflexibility. Fourteen PD subjects (both on and off medication) and 10 normal subjects performed a manual pursuit tracking task, in which the dynamics of the task suddenly change without explicit enunciation. The task dynamics have three modes, in which the error (the difference between the target and the user's cursor) is attenuated, exaggerated, or unchanged - hence we model the subject performing the tracking task as a hybrid system with arbitrary switching. Second-order stochastic LTI models of tracking performance in each mode are first obtained through system identification. We then use a multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm to determine a) whether each subject successfully adapted to the sudden change in tracking dynamics, and if so, b) the delay in switching to the new mode. These parameters were analyzed for all subjects, and found to be statistically significant across groups. While normal subjects consistently detected the change in task dynamics, PD subjects show considerably more difficulty in detecting the switch (especially off medication), and did not switch into the new mode as quickly as normal subjects. Our results suggest that PD subjects have considerable impairment in adapting to changing motor environments."
1351085,21246,9475,The privacy analysis of battery control mechanisms in demand response: Revealing state approach and rate distortion bounds,2014,"Perfect knowledge of a user's power consumption profile by a utility is a violation of privacy and can be detrimental to the successful implementation of demand response systems. It has been shown that an in-home energy storage system which provides a viable means to achieve the cost savings of instantaneous electricity pricing without inconvenience can also be used to maintain the privacy of a user's power profile. The optimization of the tradeoff between privacy, as measured by Shannon entropy, and cost savings that can be provided by a finite capacity battery with zero tolerance for delay is known to be equivalent to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with non linear belief dependent rewards— solutions to such systems suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a “revealing state” approach to enable computation of a class of battery control policies that aim to maximize the achievable privacy of in-home demands. In addition, a rate-distortion approach is presented to derive upper bounds on the privacy-cost savings tradeoff of battery control policies. These bounds are derived for a discrete model, where demand and price follow i.i.d uniform distributions. Numerical results show that the derived bounds are quite close to each other demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed class of strategies."
2541810,21246,9475,"Singular LQR control, impulse-free interconnection and optimal PD controller design",2011,"In this paper we consider the LQR control problem with no penalty on the input; this is addressed in the literature as the singular LQR control problem. We show that here the optimal controller is no longer a static controller but a PD controller. We also show that the closed loop system, i.e. the controlled system is a singular state space system. Singular system brings in the concern of existence of inadmissible initial conditions, i.e. initial conditions for which the solution is impulsive. Our main result is that there are no inadmissible initial conditions in the controlled system if and only if states which have relative degree one with respect to the input are penalised. Though the Algebraic Riccati equation is not defined for the singular case, we use the notion of storage function in dissipative systems theory to obtain the optimal cost function explicitly in terms of the initial conditions. We use this to prove that the initial conditions for which states of the autonomous (i.e. closed loop), singular system immediately jump to 0 have optimal cost 0. Our result that the optimal controller is a PD controller underlines a key intuitive statement for the dual problem, namely the Kalman-Bucy filter when measurements are noiseless: the minimum variance estimator differentiates the noiseless measurements. The MIMO case is not dealt in this paper due to space constraints and since it involves controllability indices and Forney indices in the result statements and proofs."
2703905,21246,9475,Nonlinear identification of biological clock dynamics,2015,"The paper presents an algorithm for identification of nonlinear autonomous systems in sustained periodic oscillations. The algorithm is of least squares type with a very low computational complexity, the latter being a prime target of the paper. The identified model is of second order with both right hand sides modeled by polynomials in the state variables. This choice is motivated by a recent result on identifiability. That result proves that in case the phase portrait of a measured periodic signal does not intersect itself in a 2-dimensional phase plane, then nonlinear autonomous models of a higher order than 2 cannot be uniquely identifiable. In other words, a second order ODE is sufficient for modeling of any periodic signal that does not have a 2-dimensional phase portrait that intersects itself. This is true also in cases where the underlying system that generates the periodic signal has an order that is higher than 2. The new algorithm is applied to identification of the dynamics of a biological clock that keeps track of daily variations known as circadian rhythms. The dynamics is typically created by oscillations in biochemical networks in the cells of many living organisms. The identification problem is shown to be highly non-linear in the paper. Yet good results are obtained in a numerical study that also addresses the effect of noise on the identified model."
1995771,21246,9475,Coverage-aware distributed target tracking for mobile sensor networks,2012,"In this paper, we deal with the problem of distributed target tracking with heterogeneous mobile robots. We extend the static sensor network framework, presented by some of the authors in [1], introducing a cooperative motion control algorithm. In particular, each mobile node has limited sensing range and can estimate (either by measuring or by predicting) the target position. Then, a totally distributed algorithm exploits a suitable max-consensus protocol to reach a global agreement on the best estimate available in the network at a given time instant. The algorithm is based on the spread of a perception confidence value, locally computed by every single node and related to the Fisher Information, and requires a connected network to converge. Finally, a control law based on artificial potential fields allows the agents to move in order to improve the algorithm performance. In particular, the distributed motion control algorithm is capable to trade off between different requirements: to reduce the distance between the agent and the target to improve the accuracy of the measurement, to maintain the network connectivity, to perform collision avoidance, and to maintain a desidered coverage of the sensed area. Extensive simulation results are provided to confirm the suitability of the approach."
2228504,21246,9475,Set-membership identification based adaptive robust control of systems with unknown parameter bounds,2009,"In this paper, a hybrid control architecture is proposed for the adaptive robust control of a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameter variation ranges. Specifically, the standard set-membership description of uncertainty is adopted - the bounds of the structural approximation errors associated with the parametrized models are assumed to be known but the variation ranges of model parameters are not available or poorly known. To effectively control this class of systems, set-membership identification (SMI) is performed in discrete-time domain and a simple bound-shrinking algorithm is developed to obtain non-conservative real-time estimation of the regions where model parameters could actually be. The estimated parameter variation bounds are subsequently used to construct a continuous-time domain projection type parameter adaptation law with varying boundaries to achieve a controlled learning process. An adaptive robust control (ARC) algorithm is then synthesized to handle the effect of both parametric uncertainties and the model approximation error effectively. It is theoretically shown that in general the proposed approach achieves a guaranteed transient and steady-state output tracking performance. In addition, asymptotic output tracking can also be achieved when certain conditions hold."
2640766,21246,9475,Distributed optimal equilibrium selection for traffic flow over networks,2015,"In this paper, we present two distributed algorithms to compute an equilibrium, that is optimal with respect to strictly convex and separable cost functions, for controlled traffic flow dynamics over networks under constant exogenous inflows. The dynamics is modeled in continuous time by the Cell Transmission Model and a non-FIFO Dynamic Network Loading Model, with traffic control. The two algorithms are adaptations of the alternating direct method of multipliers (ADMM) and the accelerated dual descent (ADD) method from network flow optimization literature. When the demand and supply inequality constraints in the uncontrolled dynamics are relaxed to be independent over links, the resulting feasible set is convex if the demand and supply functions are concave, thereby imparting convexity to the optimal equilibrium selection problem. Each point in the feasible set is an equilibrium for the original dynamics under appropriately designed control. For the ADMM method, explicit expressions for the primal update show that no auxiliary variables are necessary. Convergence analysis for the primal variables is also provided. The standard ADD method is extended to also incorporate non-negativity constraints on the density and flow variables, and demand and supply inequality constraints. Illustrative simulation results are also presented."
2978890,21246,9475,Distributed constrained convex optimization and consensus via dual decomposition and proximal minimization,2016,"We consider a general class of convex optimization problems over time-varying, multi-agent networks, that naturally arise in many application domains like energy systems and wireless networks. In particular, we focus on programs with separable objective functions, local (possibly different) constraint sets and a coupling inequality constraint expressed as the non-negativity of the sum of convex functions, each corresponding to one agent. We propose a novel distributed algorithm to deal with such problems based on a combination of dual decomposition and proximal minimization. Our approach is based on an iterative scheme that enables agents to reach consensus with respect to the dual variables, while preserving information privacy. Specifically, agents are not required to disclose information about their local objective and constraint functions, nor to assume knowledge of the coupling constraint. Our analysis can be thought of as a generalization of dual gradient/subgradient algorithms to a distributed set-up. We show convergence of the proposed algorithm to some optimal dual solution of the centralized problem counterpart, while the primal iterates generated by the algorithm converge to the set of optimal primal solutions. A numerical example demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is also provided."
1693519,21246,9475,ε-Nash Mean Field Game theory for nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems with mixed agents,2012,"We consider a large population dynamic game involving nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems with agents of the following mixed types: (i) a major agent, and (ii) a large N population of minor agents. The major and minor agents are coupled via both: (i) their individual nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii) their individual finite time horizon nonlinear cost functions. We approach this problem by the so-called e-Nash Mean Field Games (e-NMFG) theory. In this problem even asymptotically (as the population size N approaches infinity) the noise process of the major agent causes random fluctuation of the mean field behaviour of the minor agents. To deal with this, the overall asymptotic (N → ∞) mean field game problem is decomposed into: (i) two non-standard stochastic optimal control problems with random coefficient processes, and (ii) two stochastic (coefficient) McKean-Vlasov (SMV) equations which characterize the state of the major agent and the measure determining the mean field behaviour of the minor agents. (i) and (ii) are coupled by the (forward adapted) stochastic best response processes determined from the solution of (backward in time) stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SHJB) equations for the nonstandard optimal control problems in (i) which involve the state of the major agent and the distribution measure corresponding to the mean field behaviour of the minor agents in (ii) where these in turn depend upon the best response control processes themselves. When the so-called stochastic Mean Field (SMF) system (SHJB and SMV equations) is soluble we say the resulting framework is one of e-NMFG type."
2956298,21246,9475,Towards precise control of hoppers: Using high order partial feedback linearization to control the hopping robot FRANK,2016,"In this paper, we describe modeling and control techniques for series-elastic actuated hopping robots. There is an abundance of work regarding the implementation of highly simplified hopper models, the prevalent example being the SLIP model, with the hopes of extracting fundamental control ideas for running and hopping robots. However, real-world systems cannot be fully described by such simple models, as real actuators have their own dynamics including additional inertia and non-linear frictional losses. Therefore, an important step towards demonstrating high controllability and robustness to real-world, uneven terrain is in providing accurate higher-order models of real-world hopper dynamics. Additionally, implementing feedback control for real series-elastic actuators is difficult as the input variable does not instantaneously change the leg length acceleration. In this work we provide both hardware and simulation results that illustrate how high-order partial feedback linearization can be implemented directly on the leg length state and show how to apply these results so that algorithms in the SLIP literature can be accurately implemented in more realistic hopping systems to accomplish tasks such as apex state tracking and precise foothold planning."
2235546,21246,9475,Using stochastic linear-parameter-varying control for CPU management of internet servers,2007,"This paper presents a stochastic nonlinear control approach to performance management of Internet Web servers. In particular, a CPU frequency management problem is studied to satisfy response time SLA. The research in this paper is mainly motivated by two reasons: 1) the stochastic nature of workload characterization and performance metrics requires probabilistic approaches to system modeling and control designs, and 2) rather than over-provisioning for the worst-case load, performance management in today's Internet-server environments would limit rather than eliminate the risk of failing to meet service demand, allocating to each application the minimal server resources needed and leaving surplus resources to deploy elsewhere. The presented probabilistic linear-parameter- varying control utilizes an analytical fluid model that is scheduled by randomly distributed workload parameters, and provides control solutions via solving a stochastic semi-definite program. Evaluated through real Web server traces, the presented stochastic robust LPV control not only provides balance between meeting response time and resource efficiency, but also provides computational advantages in the implementation of control designs."
720552,21246,9475,Adaptive coarse-graining for transient and quasi-equilibrium analyses of stochastic gene regulation,2012,"Intracellular populations of genes, RNA and proteins are often described by continuous-time, discrete-state Markov processes, whose time-varying probability distributions evolve according to the large or infinite dimensional linear ordinary differential equation known as the chemical master equation (CME). Numerical integration and stochastic simulation of the CME are often impossible or time consuming. We introduce new methods to project the full CME onto a lower dimensional space, while retaining the transient and equilibrium statistics of the original process. First, we investigate three complementary sets of coarse-graining rules: (i) The previously described finite state projection approach; (ii) A modification of existing coarse-graining approaches to reduce the system dimension while capturing the processes equilibrium distribution; and (iii) New time-scale correction terms to recapture transient dynamics of the original system. Next, we explore different iterative algorithms that automatically adapt the projection resolution to improve accuracy and efficiency of the CME solution. We test these projection and refinement strategies on several gene regulatory processes, and we comment on the efficiency and accuracy of the coarse-graining rules and refinement strategies."
1207407,21246,9475,Stabilizing transmission intervals and delays for nonlinear Networked Control Systems: The large delay case,2014,"This paper proposes a methodology for computing Maximally Allowable Transfer Intervals (MATIs) that provably stabilize nonlinear Networked Control Systems (NCSs) in the presence of disturbances and signal delays. Accordingly, given a desired level of system performance (in terms of ℒ p -gains), quantitative MATI vs. delay trade-offs are obtained. By combining impulsive delayed system modeling with Lyapunov-Razumikhin type of arguments, we are able to consider even the so-called large delays. Namely, the computed MATIs can be smaller than delays existent in NCSs. In addition, our stability results are provided for the class of Uniformly Globally Exponentially Stable (UGES) scheduling protocols. The well-known Round Robin (RR) and Transmit-Once-Discard (TOD) protocols are examples of UGES protocols. Apart from the inclusion of large delays, another salient feature of our methodology is the consideration of corrupted data. To that end, we propose the notion of ℒ p -stability with bias. Furthermore, the Zeno-free property of our methodology is demonstrated. Finally, a comparison with the state-of-the-art work is provided utilizing the benchmark problem of batch reactor."
1359658,21246,9475,Kalman filter tracking of intracellular neuronal voltage and current,2011,"The nervous system encodes and processes information with the activities of neurons. The response of a single neuron is complex and depends on the interactions between its previous state, its intrinsic properties, and the stimuli it receives. Experimentally, we utilize the patch clamp technique to monitor neural membrane voltages, but the underlying stimuli, including the external current or synaptic current from other neurons, cannot be fully observed. In this paper, we used computational models as an alternative to tackle these challenges. We employed an ensemble Kalman filter to reconstruct unobserved intracellular variables and parameters only from measured membrane potentials in a CA1 pyramidal neuron model that follows Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. We found that the tracking of intracellular neuronal voltage and current was close to their true values whether the observations are from model generated data or real experimental data. In addition, we retrieved the experimentally inaccessible dynamics of the neuron, such as the changes of sodium and potassium gating variables, which helps to understand their roles in generating action potentials. Our study provides a powerful framework for observing dynamics underlying neural activity and seeking better real-time neuronal control."
2867433,21246,9475,Online model selection for synthetic gene networks,2016,"Control algorithms combined with microfluidic devices and microscopy have enabled in vivo real-time control of protein expression in synthetic gene networks. Most control algorithms rely on the a priori availability of mathematical models of the gene networks to be controlled. These models are typically black/grey box models, which can be obtained through the use of data-driven techniques developed in the context of systems identification. Data-driven inference of both model structure and parameters is the main focus of this paper. There are two main challenges associated with the inference of dynamical models for real-time control of gene regulatory networks in living cells. Since biological systems are typically evolving over time, the first challenge stems from the fact that model selection needs to be done online, which prevents the application of computationally expensive identification algorithms iterating through large amounts of streaming data. The second challenge consists in performing nonlinear model selection, which is typically too burdensome for Kalman filtering related techniques due the heterogeneity and nonlinearity of the candidate models. In this paper, we combine sparse Bayesian techniques with classic Kalman filtering techniques to tackle these challenges."
996815,21246,9475,Plug-and-play control and optimization in microgrids,2014,"A hierarchical layering of primary, secondary, and tertiary control is the standard operation paradigm for bulk power systems. Similar hierarchical decision architectures have been proposed for microgrids. However, the control objectives in microgrids must be achieved while allowing for robust plug-and-play operation and maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision making, time-scale separations, and central authorities. Here, we explore control and optimization strategies for the three decision layers and illuminate some possibly-unexpected connections and dependencies among them. Our analysis builds upon first-principle models and decentralized droop control. We investigate distributed architectures for secondary frequency regulation and find that averaging-based distributed controllers using communication among the generation units offer the best combination of flexibility and performance. We further leverage these results to study constrained AC economic dispatch in a tertiary control layer. We show that the minimizers of the economic dispatch problem are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of steady-states reachable by droop control. This equivalence results in simple guidelines to select the droop coefficients, which include the known criteria for load sharing."
1383703,21246,9475,Optimization of spatially distributed systems with spatially local controllers and partial connectivity,2014,"This paper presents two different design approaches of networked distributed controllers for a class of partial differential equations. Such a work attempts to reduce controller complexity by opting to control a spatially distributed process by a network of interconnected control units. This approach reduces the need to use a centralized controller that must fuse sensory information by the distributed sensors and then dispense the controllers to the spatially distributed process via the spatially distributed actuators. In the first approach, the controller gains used to implement the local controllers by the controller units, along with the actuator and sensor location and the network connectivity are optimized by formulating the optimization problem into a minimization problem of an appropriately chosen performance measure of the closed-loop system. This takes the form of a parameterized operator Lyapunov equation whose optimal solution provides the optimal (proportional) controller gains, the optimal locations of the actuators and sensors, and the optimal network connectivity. The second approach considers the adaptation of the gains of the distributed controllers using Lyapunov-redesign methods to extract their adaptation. The well-posedness and convergence properties of the proposed controllers are summarized and numerical studies examining various aspects of the proposed work are presented."
2071479,21246,9475,Boundary feedback control in Fluid-Structure Interactions,2008,"We consider a boundary control system for a fluid structure interaction model. This system describes the motion of an elastic structure inside a viscous fluid with interaction taking place at the boundary of the structure, and with the possibility of controlling the dynamics from this boundary. Our aim is to construct a real time feedback control based on a solution to a Riccati equation. The difficulty of the problem under study is due to the unboundedness of the control action, which is typical in boundary control problems. However, this class of unbounded control systems, due to its physical relevance, has attracted a lot of attention in recent literature (cf. [5], [18], [11]). It is known that Riccati feedback (unbounded) controls may develop strong singularities which destroy the well-posedness of Riccati equations. This makes computational implementations problematic, to say the least. However, as shown recently, this pathology does not happen for certain classes of unbounded control systems usually referred to as singular estimate control systems (SECS) (cf. [11], [21]). For such systems, there is a full and optimal Riccati theory in place, which leads to the well-posedness of feedback dynamics. Our objective is to show that the boundary control problem in question falls in the class of singular estimate control systems (SECS). Once this is accomplished, an application of the theory in [21] leads to the main result of this paper which is well-posedness of Riccati equations and of the Riccati feedback synthesis."

A critical step in these methods is the splitting of causal and noncausal invariant subspaces of a Hankel matrix built from spectrum measurements via singular-value decomposition in order to determine the model order. Quite often, in particular when signal-to-noise ratio is low, unmodelled dynamics is present, and when the number of measurements is small, this step is not conclusive since the assumed mirror image symmetry with respect to the unit circle between the eigenvalues of the invariant spaces is lost. In this paper, we propose a robust model order selection scheme based on the regularized nuclear norm optimization in combination with a particular subspace method. By a numerical example, efficacy of the proposed scheme is shown for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratio and short data records. Then, in a real-life example, the proposed scheme, integrated into a recently developed subspace-based algorithm, is used to estimate cross-power spectra of induction motors from sound data collected by a microphone array in a test rig."
2260032,21246,9475,Efficiency loss and uniform-price mechanism,2008,"We investigate the properties of the class of resource allocation mechanisms with uniform pricing scheme. An important consequence of the assumption that agents maximize their profits is that both the resource price and the quantities assigned to agents can be viewed as the implicit functions of the messages communicated to the mechanism. As a result agents? individual decisions become interdependent, which makes each agent capable of anticipating the effects of individual actions on the price of the resource. Focusing our attention on the Nash equilibrium solution concept we discuss the efficiency of equilibrium allocations of the game defined by the allocation mechanism both from the perspective of the global system goals and the individual objectives of agents. Our first contribution is the ranking of three variations of the uniform-price mechanism. We demonstrate the significant role of strategic variables used by agents and analyze mechanism designer?s best response to agents? expected price-anticipating behavior. Since the resource allocation model being subject to our considerations can very well serve as a description of the uniform-price auction for divisible resources, the results of this paper can be viewed as an inquiry into properties of this auction format. As a second contribution we show how signals exchanged between agents and the mechanism can be successfully used to reach an equilibrium point in an iterative bidding process."
1037020,21246,9475,An event-triggered Model Predictive Control scheme for freeway systems,2012,"Objective of this paper is to define an efficient control framework for freeway systems based on ramp metering. First of all, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is proposed in which the well known nonlinear cell transmission model (CTM) is used for the prediction. The model is then reformulated as a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system, i.e. it is described by linear dynamic equations and linear inequalities in which both continuous and binary variables are present. In this way, the finite-horizon optimal control problem in the MPC scheme is transformed into a mixed integer quadratic programming problem whose objective function quadratically penalizes the deviation of the state variables from a specific equilibrium point. It is shown that the resulting control law stabilizes the system. Moreover, in order to make it more suitable for a real-time use, the foregoing control strategy is redesigned into an event-triggered control scheme. The idea is to update the control law only when the considered error exceeds a pre-specified threshold. Simulation results demonstrate how the use of the triggering rule allows to preserve the good performance of the proposed control scheme, while reducing the overall computational load."
1566501,21246,9475,Improved Feed-Forward Command Governor strategies for discrete-time time-invariant linear systems,2011,"This paper presents a novel enhanced algorithm belonging to the class of so-called Feed-Forward Command Governor (FF-CG) strategies, characterized by the absence of any explicit on-line measure (or estimation) of the state, which have been recently proposed in [1], [2] for input/state constrained discrete-time linear systems subject to bounded disturbances. In fact, while in all traditional CG schemes the set-point manipulation is undertaken on the basis of either the actual measure of the state or its suitable estimation, feed-forward strategies are characterized by the fact that the CG design problem is explicitly solved, with limited performance degradation and with similar properties, in the absence of such a measure. This is achieved by forcing the system evolutions to stay “not too far” from the space of feasible steady-states. Although effective also in the case of bounded disturbances, the performance of earlier FF-CG schemes [1], [2] was mainly limited by the fact that such strategies were instructed to maintain constant their actions for a prescribed number of sampling steps between two subsequent CG action computation. Here such a restriction is completely removed and a novel class of FF-CG schemes able to update their actions at each sampling step is discussed. Finally, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, numerical simulations on a physical plant have been undertaken and comparison results reported."
3005544,21246,9475,Order determination and robust adaptive control of unknown deterministic input-affine systems: An operational controller,2016,"In most direct adaptive control techniques the dynamic order of systems are assumed to be known. However, this assumption in most real-world problems is not met. Fostered by addressing this problem, this paper presents a methodology to design an operational controller for a specific class of deterministic input-affine systems. Meaning, in the first phase the dynamic order of the unknown system is determined contingent upon a correlation-based heuristic criterion through exciting the system and gathering input-output data samples. Without any a priori knowledge about the system except the fact that its maximum order is less than a known number, with an intelligent search among all possible models, the suggested algorithm precisely identifies the dynamic order of the system. In the second phase, needless to estimate parameters of the system, a robust adaptive technique is designed to update parameters of the controller in order to track a bounded differentiable reference signal without chattering. The robustness and maximum error of the suggested control strategy for input-affine systems whose parameters are varying limitedly is also investigated. Effectiveness and pros-and-cons of the proposed approach are comprehensively discussed and shown through variety of simulations."
2541160,21246,9475,Sending the most recent observation is not optimal in networked control: Linear temporal coding and towards the design of a control specific transport protocol,2007,"This paper explores diversity of temporal observations in a networked control system or sensor network. We analyze what information should be sent between a sensor and a controller (or estimator) in a networked control system (or sensor network) where the two components are separated by an unreliable, bandwidth limited communication. Packets may be dropped at any time. Given a sensor of limited computational and storage capability restricted to transmitting linear combinations of measurements, we consider what should be transmitted following a packet drop - the most recent observation, the previously dropped observation, or a combination of the two? We show that the common practice of sending only the most recent observation is not optimal. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal linear combination of past and present observations. We address a special case where sensor bandwidth (or sampling rate) is higher than communication bandwidth (or throughput), and deal with the case of multiple dropped packets. These results suggest the design of a transport layer specific to networked control which optimizes packet contents contingent on previous packet loss. Alternatively, one could optimize access between contending sensors for a scarce communication medium. The results could be regarded as network coding across time. Simulations are used to illustrate the theoretical results."
1453356,21246,8441,On balanced realization of linear quantum stochastic systems and model reduction by quasi-balanced truncation,2013,"This paper derives conditions under which co-diagonalization of the controllability and observability Gramians can be performed in a physically consistent manner for the class of linear quantum stochastic systems that are common in the fields of quantum optics and related areas like quantum nano- and optomechanical systems. Such a class is essentially a quantum analogue of classical (non-quantum) linear stochastic systems. However, unlike their classical counterparts, the laws of quantum mechanics impose nonlinear equality constraints on the system matrices of linear quantum stochastic systems, the so-called physical realizability constraints. Therefore, a meaningful model reduction procedure must yield a physically realizable reduced model satisfying these constraints. Previous work has shown that model reduction by subsystem truncation preserves physical realizability, but did not propose a method for truncating a subsystem. One candidate approach for this truncation is a quantum adaptation of the well-known balanced truncation method for classical linear time-invariant systems. It is shown in this paper that balanced realization for linear quantum stochastic systems is only possible under a strongly restrictive necessary and sufficient condition. However, the paper also derives less restrictive necessary and sufficient conditions for other realizations with simultaneously diagonal controllability and observability Gramians, and introduces the notion of a quasi-balanced realization. An example of the application of the results is provided to demonstrate quasi-balanced truncation in the linear quantum stochastic setting."
2693613,21246,9475,Nonlinear projection filter with parallel algorithm and parallel sensors,2015,"Over the past few decades, the computational power has been increasing rapidly. With advances of the parallel computation architectures it provides new opportunities for solving the optimal estimation problem in real-time. In addition, sensor miniaturization technology enables us to acquire multiple measurements at low cost. Kolmogorov's forward equation is the governing equation of the nonlinear estimation problem. The nonlinear projection filter presented in the late 90's is an almost exact solution of the nonlinear estimation problem, which solves the governing equation using Galerkin's method. The filter requires high-dimensional integration in several steps and the complexity of the filter increases exponentially with the dimension of systems. The current parallel computation speed with the usage of many sensors at the same time make it feasible to implement the filter efficiently for practical systems with some mild dimension sizes. On-line or off-line multi-dimensional integration is to be performed over the parallel computation using the Monte-Carlo integration method and random samples for the state update are obtained more efficiently based on the multiple sensor measurements. A few simplifications of the filter are also derived to reduce the computational cost. The methods are verified with two numerical examples and one experimental example."
799697,21246,9475,Epidemic spread in human networks,2011,"One of the popular dynamics on complex networks is the epidemic spreading. An epidemic model describes how infections spread throughout a network. Among the compartmental models used to describe epidemics, the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model has been widely used. In the SIS model, each node can be susceptible, become infected with a given infection rate, and become again susceptible with a given curing rate. In this paper, we add a new compartment to the classic SIS model to account for human response to epidemic spread. In our model, each individual can be infected, susceptible, or alert. Susceptible individuals can become alert with an alerting rate if infected individuals exist in their neighborhood. Due to a newly adopted cautious behavior, an individual in the alert state is less probable to become infected. The problem is modeled as a continuous-time Markov process on a generic graph and then formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations. The model is then studied using results from spectral graph theory and center manifold theorem. We analytically show that our model exhibits two distinct thresholds in the dynamics of epidemic spread. Below the first threshold, infection dies out exponentially. Beyond the second threshold, infection persists in the steady state. Between the two thresholds, infection spreads at the first stage but then dies out asymptotically as the result of increased alertness in the network. Finally, simulations are provided to support our findings."
1517419,21246,9475,Discrete parameter simulation optimization algorithms with applications to admission control with dependent service times,2007,"We propose certain discrete parameter variants of well known simulation optimization algorithms. Two of these algorithms are based on the smoothed functional (SF) technique while two others are based on the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method. They differ from each other in the way perturbations are obtained and also the manner in which projections and parameter updates are performed. All our algorithms use two simulations and two- timescale stochastic approximation. As an application setting, we consider the important problem of admission control of packets in communication networks under dependent service times. We consider a discrete time slotted queueing model of the system and consider two different scenarios - one where the service times have a dependence on the system state and the other where they depend on the number of arrivals in a time slot. Under our settings, the simulated objective function appears ill-behaved with multiple local minima and a unique global minimum characterized by a sharp dip in the objective function in a small region of the parameter space. We compare the performance of our algorithms on these settings and observe that the two SF algorithms show the best results overall. In fact, in many cases studied, SF algorithms converge to the global minimum."
2903916,21246,9475,Intent aware shared control in off-nominal situations,2016,"We propose a new shared control technique that takes into account the operator's intent to quickly relinquish control to the operator in off-nominal conditions. Human-machine shared control is an emerging area of research in which the autonomous control is utilized to augment the operator's performance. Existing work has established that shared control can improve cycle times in nominal conditions, that is, when the operating environment satisfies the assumptions made in the design of the optimal augmenting controller. However, these methods can be too slow to relinquish control in off-nominal cases, when the operator needs to deviate from the nominally optimal trajectory due to unforeseen obstacles or other uncertainties. In this paper, we attempt to address this gap by mathematically quantifying operator intent. The resulting technique provides autonomous control augmentation to the operator when they are attempting to drive the system along the suggested optimal trajectory, but offers little hindrance to the operator when they are attempting to deal with off-nominal conditions. Theoretical results show that the performance of the presented intent aware shared control technique is at least as good as existing techniques, and that it results in improved obstacle reaction time. Human interaction experiments on the Zermelo's navigation problem in the presence of a random pop-up obstacle show a significant reduction in obstacle collision with our method when compared to existing work."
3015330,21246,9475,Adapting strategies to dynamic environments in controllable stackelberg security games,2016,"There is a growing interest in applying Stackelberg games to model resource allocation for patrolling security problems in which defenders must allocate limited security resources to protect targets from attack by adversaries. In real-world adversaries are sophisticated presenting dynamic strategies. Most existing approaches for computing defender strategies calculate the game against fixed behavioral models of adversaries, and cannot ensure success in the realization of the game. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a novel approach for adapting preferred strategies in controlled Stackelberg security games using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for attackers and defenders employing an average rewards.We propose a common framework that combines prior knowledge and temporal-difference method in reinforcement learning. The overall RL architecture involves two highest components: the adaptive primary learning architecture and the actor-critic architecture. In this work we consider a Stackelberg security game in case of a metric state space for a class of time-discrete ergodic controllable Markov chains games. For computing the equilibrium point we employ the extraproximal method. Finally, a game theory example illustrates the main results and the effectiveness of the method."
1491279,21246,9475,An actor critic algorithm based on Grassmanian search,2014,"We propose the first online actor-critic scheme with adaptive basis to find a local optimal control policy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) under the weighted discounted cost objective. We parameterize both the policy in the actor and the value function in the critic. The actor performs gradient search in the space of policy parameters using simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) gradient estimates. This gradient computation requires estimates of value function that are provided by the critic by minimizing a mean square Bellman error objective. In order to obtain good estimates of the value function, the critic adaptively tunes the basis functions (or the features) to obtain the best representation of the value function using gradient search in the Grassmanian of features. Our control algorithm makes use of multi-timescale stochastic approximation. The actor updates its parameters along the slowest time scale. The critic uses two time scales to estimate the value function. For any given feature value, our algorithm performs gradient search in the parameter space via a residual gradient scheme on the faster timescale and, on a medium timescale, performs gradient search in the Grassman manifold of features. We provide an outline of the proof of convergence of our control algorithm to a locally optimum policy. We show empirical results using our algorithm as well as a similar algorithm that uses temporal difference (TD) learning in place of the residual gradient scheme for the faster timescale updates."
1043940,21246,9475,Novel environment for the practical implementation of higher order sliding mode controllers,2013,"A novel analogue circuit environment to implement higher order sliding mode (HOSM) and continuous finite time (CFT) stabilising controllers is proposed in this paper. The novelty lies in the ability of the circuit to capture the underlying theoretical features by producing non-Lipschtiz controller implementations. The circuit can be built using readily available off-the-shelf components. Since the environment is based on an analogue circuit, the development matches the mathematics of a class of non-Lipschitz differential equations more closely than its digital counterparts thereby narrowing the theory-practice gap. The key contribution is the implementation of a class of non-Lipschitz controllers using analogue components thereby nullifying steady-state tracking errors without the need for integral action, a key concept of both HOSM and CFT philosophies with the former being more robust. The circuit has plug-and-play functionality similar to the ubiquitous PID controllers, where recent results on the tuning of HOSM controller parameters give the potential to replicate the classical PID controller tuning approach. The functionality is demonstrated by the closed-loop speed control of a dc motor, although the results are applicable to other engineering problems which are also discussed."
1189171,21246,9475,The two-state estimator for linear systems with additive measurement and process Cauchy noise,2012,"The conditional mean estimator for a two-state linear system with additive Cauchy measurement and process noises is developed. Although the Cauchy densities that model the process and measurement noise have an undefined first moment and an infinite second moment, the probability density function conditioned on linear noisy measurements does have a finite mean and variance. The conditional probability density function (cpdf) given the measurement history appears to be difficult to compute directly. However, the characteristic function of the unnormalized cpdf can be sequentially propagated through measurement updates and dynamic state propagation. A key step in processing a measurement lies in obtaining a closed form solution of an associated convolution integral. The solution obtained in this work is presented as a sum of terms all contributing to the structure of the characteristic function of the unnormalized cpdf, where the number of terms grows arithmetically with time. Many of these terms have a negligible contribution and can therefore be pruned. Once this characteristic is obtained, the mean and variance are easily computed from the first and second derivatives of the characteristic function, evaluated at the origin in the spectral variables' domain. A two-state dynamic system example numerically demonstrates the Cauchy estimator's performance compared with that of a Kalman filter for simulations using both Cauchy and Gaussian noises."
2916387,21246,9475,Intrusion analysis with deep packet inspection: Increasing efficiency of packet based investigations,2011,"Cloud computing's distributed architecture helps ensure service resilience and robustness. However, cloud architectures also increase dynamic data communications which inherently increases security risks. Examination of industry practice has revealed that increased data volume, as a result of increased communication, diminishes the efficiency of deep packet inspections (DPI). DPI is essential in protecting the cloud against malicious threats such as web exploits, zeroday attacks, data exfiltration, and malware based botnets. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of a new utility that was developed to improve retrospective packet analysis which was tested against actual data center traffic from a large regional Internet Access Provider providing cloud services. Blitzdump is a lightning fast network data packet capture utility developed to improve network intrusion detection through deep packet inspection analysis. Implementation results indicate it outperformed existing techniques, in terms of query function performance, that ultimately improved efficiency in query responses by up to 6000%. Blitzdump reduces security risks by increasing the technical performance of intrusion detection to improve the security practitioner's productivity and effectiveness."
2179550,21246,9475,Quantized measurement fusion for target tracking in wireless sensor networks,2009,"The quantized measurement fusion problem for target tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is investigated. Due to the limited energy and bandwidth, each activated node quantizes and then transmits the local measurements by probabilistic quantization strategy. The fusion center (FC) estimates the target state in a dimension compression way instead of merging all the quantized messages to a vector (augmented scheme). In this paper, focuses are on tradeoff between energy consumption and the global tracking accuracy. A closed-form solution to the optimization problem for bandwidth scheduling is given, where the total energy consumption measure is minimized subject to a constraint on the mean square error (MSE) incurred by quasi-best linear unbiased estimation (Quasi-BLUE) fusion. Nonlinear Gaussian discrete-time system model following the Sigma-point Kalman Filtering (SPKF) principle is employed. Simulation example illustrates the proposed scheme obtains average percentage of communication energy saving up to 44.9% compared with the uniform quantization, while keeps computational burden reduction 12% compared with the augmented scheme."
1239609,21246,9475,On consensus in a correlated model of network formation based on a Polya urn process,2011,"In this paper, we consider a consensus seeking process based on local averaging of opinions in a dynamic model of social network formation. At each time step, individual agents randomly choose another agent to interact with. The interaction is one-sided and results in the agent averaging her opinion with that of her randomly chosen neighbor. Once an agent chooses a neighbor, the probabilities of interactions are updated in such a way that prior interactions are reinforced and future interactions become more likely, resulting in a random consensus process in which networks are highly correlated with each other. Using results of Skyrm and Pemantle and utilizing the de Finetti representation theorem as well as properties of Polya urn processes, we show that this highly correlated process is equivalent to a mixture of i.i.d. processes whose parameters are drawn from a random limit distribution. Therefore, prior results on consensus on i.i.d. processes can be used to show consensus and to compute the statistics of the consensus value in terms of the initial conditions. We provide simple expressions for the mean and the variance of the asymptotic random consensus value in terms of the number of nodes. We also show that the variance converges to a factor of the empirical variance of the initial values that depends only on the size of the network and goes to zero as the size of the network grows."
2652901,21246,9475,Adaptive NN control for uncertain pure-feedback nonlinear systems with state constraints subject to unknown disturbances,2015,"This paper addresses the output tracking control for a class of non-affine nonlinear systems in pure-feedback form with unknown dynamics subject to full state constraints and unknown external time-varying bounded disturbances. This problem is challenging due to the non-affine structure coupling with the constraints on states and external disturbances. To overcome the problem, the mean value theorem is applied to deduce the variables with affine appearance in the system dynamics, and the integral Barrier Lyapunov Functionals (iBLFs) are utilized in the recursive backstepping design to handle the unknown deduced control gains and state constraints together, and adapting parameters are developed to estimate the unknown bounds on neural networks (NNs) reconstruction errors and external disturbances. Through Lyapunov synthesis, all signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and all state constraints are guaranteed provided that the states are initially in the constrained regions, and tracking errors are ensured to converge to an adjustable neighborhood of desired trajectory. An application to Van der Pol oscillator with state constraints illustrates the performance of proposed control."
962786,21246,9475,New convergence and exact performance results for linear consensus algorithms using relative entropy and lossless passivity properties,2013,"Despite the importance of the linear consensus algorithm for networked systems, yet, there is no agreement on the intrinsic mathematical structure that supports the observed exponential averaging behavior among n agents for any initial condition. Here we add to this discussion in linear consensus theory by introducing relative entropy as a novel Lyapunov function. We show that the configuration space of consensus systems is isometrically embedded into a statistical manifold. On projective n-1-space relative entropy is a common time-invariant Lyapunov function along solutions of the time-varying algorithm. For cases of scaled symmetry of the update law, we expose a gradient flow structure underlying the dynamics that evolve relative entropy in a steepest descent gradient scheme. On that basis we provide exact performance rates and upper bounds based on spectral properties of the update law governing the behavior on the statistical manifold. The condition of scaled symmetry allows to exhibit gradient flow structures for cases where the original update law is neither doubly stochastic, nor self-adjoint. The results related to the gradient flow structure are obtained by exploiting lossless passivity properties.We show that lossless passivity of a dynamical system implies a gradient flow structure on a manifold and vice versa. Exploiting lossless passivity amounts to constructing the combination of dissipation (pseudo)metric with Lyapunov function."
2946147,21246,9475,Mean-square estimation with high dimensional log-concave noise,2016,"We consider the problem of mean-square estimation of the state of a discrete time dynamical system having additive non-Gaussian noise. We assume that the noise has the structure that at each time instant, it is a projection of a fixed high-dimensional noise vector with a log-concave density. We derive conditions which guarantee that, as the dimension of this noise vector grows large relative to the dimension of the state space, the observation space, and the time horizon, the optimal estimator of the problem with Gaussian noise becomes near-optimal for the problem with non-Gaussian noise. The results are derived by first showing an asymptotic Gaussian lower bound on the minimum error which holds even for nonlinear systems. This lower bound is shown to be asymptotically tight for linear systems. For nonlinear systems this bound is tight provided the noise has a strongly log-concave density with some additional structure. These results imply that estimates obtained by employing the Gaussian estimator on the non-Gaussian problem satisfy an approximate orthogonality principle. Moreover, the difference between the optimal estimate and the estimate derived from the Gaussian estimator vanishes strongly in L 2 . For linear systems, we get that the Kalman filter serves as a near-optimal estimator. A key ingredient in the proofs is a recent central limit theorem of Eldan and Klartag."
1210171,21246,9475,On the exactness of semidefinite relaxation for nonlinear optimization over graphs: Part II,2013,"This work is concerned with finding a global optimization technique for a broad class of nonlinear optimization problems, including quadratic and polynomial optimizations. The main objective of this two-part paper is to investigate how the (hidden) structure of a given real/complex-valued optimization makes the problem easy to solve. To this end, three conic relaxations are proposed and it is proved that some or all of these relaxations are exact if the optimization is highly structured. More precisely, the structure of the optimization is mapped into a generalized weighted graph, where each edge is associated with a weight set extracted from the coefficients of the optimization. In Part I of the paper, it is shown that the relaxations are all exact for general graphs in the real-valued case and for acyclic graphs in the complex-valued case, provided the weight sets satisfy some sign definiteness conditions. In this part of the paper, the complex-valued case is further studied, and three structural properties are derived for the generalized weighted graph, each of which guarantees the exactness of some of the proposed relaxations. It is also shown that this result holds true if the graph can be decomposed as a union of edge-disjoint subgraphs, where each subgraph has one of the derived structural properties. As an application of this paper, it is finally proved that a broad class of optimization problems for power networks are polynomial-time solvable due to the passivity of transmission lines and transformers."
822687,21246,9475,Distributed market clearing with wind generation and large-scale dispatchable loads,2014,"Risk-cognizant power dispatch techniques are urgently needed towards achieving the goal of high-penetration renewables in the future power smart grids. In this paper, day-ahead stochastic market clearing based on the DC optimal power flow (OPF) model is pursued accounting for the stochastic availability of renewables. The objective is to minimize the grid-wide total cost which consists of the conventional generation cost, the end-users' utility, as well as the energy transaction cost utilizing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). The proposed CVaR-based transaction cost serves as a smart regularizer to mitigate the potentially high risk of inadequate wind power. The sample average approximation method is introduced to bypass the prohibitive high-dimensional integral in the resulting optimization problem. Furthermore, to address the challenges of respecting end-users' privacy and the computational complexity incurred by large-scale dispatchable loads, a fast ADMM-based solver is developed with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results are reported to corroborate the merits of the novel framework and the proposed approaches."
2409536,21246,9475,Stable digital control networks for continuous passive plants subject to delays and data dropouts,2007,"This paper provides a framework to synthesize l 2 - stable networks in which the controller and plant can be subject to delays and data dropouts. This framework can be applied to control systems which use soft-real-time cooperative schedulers as well as those which use wired and wireless network feedback. The approach applies to passive plants and controllers that can be either linear, nonlinear, and (or) time-varying. This framework is based on fundamental results presented here related to passive control and scattering theory which are used to design passive force-feedback telemanipulation systems. Theorem 3 states how a (non)linear (strictly input or strictly output) passive plant can be transformed to a discrete (strictly input) passive plant using a particular digital sampling and hold scheme. Furthermore, theorem 4(5) provide new sufficient conditions for l 2  (and L 2 )-stability in which a strictly - output passive controller and plant are interconnected with only wave-variables. Lemma 2 shows it is sufficient to use discrete wave-variables when data is subject to fixed time delays and dropouts in order to maintain passivity. Lemma 3 shows how to safely handle time varying discrete wave-variable data in order to maintain passivity. We then present a new cooperative scheduler algorithm to implement a I 2 -stable control network. We also provide an illustrative simulated example followed by a discussion of future research."
1131199,21246,9475,Equilibrium price distributions in energy markets with shiftable demand,2012,"The paper examines existence of equilibrium price distributions in energy markets with real-time pricing and consumers with time-flexible demands. Previous works have examined consumer optimal policies for shifting time-flexible loads up to a deadline, in response to an exogenous and stochastic price process. It is shown here that under some mild assumptions on the stochastic price process and the information structure in the market, the individual consumer's optimal policy is a threshold policy. The threshold policy indicates that a consumer will consume only when the price falls below a certain threshold which depends on the time left to his deadline and the information on the price process. This behavior by individual consumer leads to an aggregate behavior by a large number of consumers who implement threshold policies in reaction to the price process; although at each instant of time, different consumers may have different thresholds due to different deadlines and different information assumptions. The aggregate response from the consumers determines the state of the wholesale market, and thus, affects the price process. The question that we intend to answer in this paper is that of consistency of assumptions on the price process and the market outcomes. It is assumed that the price at each time interval is determined by the Independent Service Operator (ISO) on the basis of an estimate of the global consumption as a function of price. It is shown that under technical regularity assumptions on the model components, the price distribution has at least one equilibrium point. Thus, there exists at least one price process that is consistent both with the consumption behavior of the aggregate of consumers who individually implement threshold policies, and the marginal cost pricing mechanism of the ISO."
1131024,21246,9475,Energy management for buildings and microgrids,2011,"Intelligent consumer energy management systems will become important elements at the delivery points of the smart grid inside homes, buildings, and industrial plants. The end users will be able to better monitor and manage their energy consumption, while utilities will gain more flexible mechanisms for management of peak demands that will extend beyond demand response initiatives as they are implemented today. With a broader use of distributed generation many buildings and campuses will become microgrids interconnecting multiple generation, storage, and consumption devices of one or several end users. We discuss how energy management and control for such facilities can be viewed as a large-scale optimization problem. Specific supply-side and demand-side aspects include on-site renewable generation, storage technologies, electric cars, dynamic pricing, and load management. Technical challenges related to the optimization formulation are noted - in general, mixed-integer, nonlinear, constrained optimization is needed. We also describe an implementation of optimization-based energy management solution for a hospital in the Netherlands, providing economic details and an analysis of the savings achieved."
1088499,21246,9475,Performance bounds for CSMA-based medium access control,2011,"In recent work, it was shown that the class of distributed random access MAC schemes leveraging Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) is throughput-optimal. To fully assess the potential of such schemes, it is challenging to study their performance in terms of mean delays and compare it against that of centralized scheduling. In this paper, we present upper and lower bounds on the performance of CSMA-based random access MAC. We modify the ideal CSMA model to obtain one that further incorporates queue length information and admits a product-form stationary distribution. We analytically calculate its mean delay at the steady-state, and show that it yields an upper bound on the delay of ideal CSMA. We also derive a lower bound which is independent of the scheduling algorithm. The derived bounds coincide with the best known bounds for the popular max-weight scheduling, whence the performance of such distributed low-complexity schemes lies in the same regime as that of the centralized, generally NP-hard max-weight scheduling. Our results extend to slotted systems, as well as to a wide range of arrival-service processes. Finally, we develop a method for deriving upper and lower bounds on the performance of MAC algorithms by use of Linear Programming (LP) and present comparative simulation results."

A sequence of optical measurements of an Earth orbiting object over a single track has sufficient information to determine the topocentric angles and angular rates with some degree of precision, but yields no information on the range and range-rate other than the restriction that they lie within some open set containing energetically bound nonimpact orbits. These restrictions constrain the orbit to lie on a two-dimensional submanifold, known as the admissible region, of the six-dimensional phase space that can be computed using the recorded data. Given two measurements, the orbit determination problem is tantamount to finding the “closest” point between two such submanifolds. However, distance itself can be defined in a plethora of different ways in the space of Keplerian orbits. In this paper we construct a natural metric in the four-dimensional space of Keplerian orbits of fixed energy and consider some basic topological questions of mappings from the admissible region to a natural representation of this space. Using the metric presented in this paper, the “shortest distance” between the two admissible regions can be approximated. We present this as a new approach in dealing with one aspect of the space situational awareness problem."
1098950,21246,9475,"A non-myopic, receding horizon control strategy for an AUV to track an underwater target in a bistatic sonar scenario",2014,"We investigate how to improve the autonomy of AUVs to operate effectively in a multistatic network for littoral surveillance. We present a novel algorithm to control the movement of an AUV towing a line array acting as a receiver node in the network. The proposed algorithm uses a non-myopic, receding horizon policy to control the AUV heading to minimize the expected target position estimation error of a tracking filter. Minimizing this error is typically of the utmost interest in target state estimation since it is one way of maintaining track. Methods to simplify the resulting decision tree are used together with a branch and bound technique to solve an optimization problem at each ping time with the low computational power available onboard AUVs. Results from COLLAB13 sea trials are reported and show both the feasibility of running the algorithm in real-time on an onboard computer and the benefits of using the proposed algorithm over conventional predefined paths. These results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful demonstration at sea of a complex non-myopic algorithm running in real-time on AUVs in a realistic multistatic littoral surveillance scenario."
1841378,21246,9475,Partial pole placement with minimum norm controller,2010,"The problem of placing an arbitrary subset (m) of the (n) closed loop eigenvalues of a n th  order continuous time single input linear time invariant(LTI) system, using full state feedback, is considered. The required locations of the remaining (n − m) closed loop eigenvalues are not precisely specified. However, they are required to be placed anywhere inside a pre-defined region in the complex plane. The resulting non-uniqueness is utilized to minimize the controller effort through optimization of the feedback gain vector norm. Using a variant of the boundary crossing theorem, the region constraint on the unspecified (n−m) poles is translated into a quadratic constraint on the characteristic polynomial coefficients. The resulting quadratically constrained quadratic program can be approximated by a quadratic program with linear constraints. The proposed theory is demonstrated for power oscillation damping controller design, where the eigenvalues corresponding to poorly damped electro-mechanical modes are critical for performance and hence are specified precisely by the designer, whereas the remaining eigenvalues are non-critical and need not be specified precisely. Acceptable closed loop pole placement is achieved for this example along with a 51% reduction in controller norm."
1891948,21246,9475,On the use of numerical methods for analysis and control of nonlinear convective systems,2008,"A common approach to designing feedback controllers for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is to linearize the system about an equilibrium and use the linearized model as a starting point in the design process. In many practical applications (fluid flow control, thermal fluids, etc.) the equilibrium of interest is not the trivial zero state and this equilibrium must be computed numerically. This can be a complex task, especially if the equilibrium is unstable. In an earlier paper the authors showed that even for the 1D Burgers? equation, standard time marching numerical schemes can produce false steady state solutions. Consequently, in this case the first step in the design and analysis process is based on an erroneous linearization and even robust controllers may fail. It has been suggested that replacing the time marching scheme by a Newton algorithm would eliminate this false equilibrium. In this short paper we illustrate that even Newton?s method can produce a numerically false equilibrium in problems that are highly sensitivity to boundary conditions. This result has important consequences when one uses numerical tools for design and control of non-linear partial differential equations that govern typical fluid flows."
2254068,21246,9475,Application of potent potential functions in eye/head movement control,2010,"In this paper we study the human eye movement and the head movement system as a simple mechanical control system. Most of the time, eye movements obey Listing's constraint, which states that the allowed orientations of the eye are obtained by rotating a fixed ‘primary gaze direction’ by a subclass of rotation matrices. These rotation matrices have their axes of rotation restricted to a fixed plane perpendicular to the primary gaze direction. Likewise, a spontaneous head movement satisfy Donder's constraint which is similar to the Listing's constraint except that the axes of rotation of the head away from a primary head position is restricted to a fixed surface, which is not necessarily a plane. When head is restrained to remain fixed, eye movement satisfies the Listing's constraint throughout its entire trajectory. On the other hand, when the head is allowed to move (satisfying the Donder's constraint), the eye satisfies the Listing's constraint only at the beginning and at the end of a trajectory. Intermediate points of the trajectory, partially guided by the vestibulo-ocular reflex, do not apparently satisfy the Listing's constraint. In this paper we introduce control strategy that would regulate the eye from an initial to a final gaze position with or without satisfaction of the Listing's constraint during all the intermediate points of the eye movement trajectory. We study the head movement problem under the assumption that the head always satisfies the Donder's constraint. The control signals are generated by choosing a suitable potential function and adding to it a suitable damping term. The overall dynamical system is constructed using the well known Euler Lagrange's equation. The main result of this paper is to compare, using simulations, the total distance and the total time it takes to regulate the eye and the head between two orientations."
2703827,21246,9475,Duration-deadline jointly differentiated energy services,2015,"The demand/supply balance in a power grid faces great challenges as more and more renewables are integrated into the system. Fluctuations in the power supply increases spectacularly owing to the uncertain nature of renewables. In this case, it has been widely recognized that the conventional scheme of supply following load is neither economically efficient nor environmentally friendly. On the contrary, an alternative paradigm has been attracting more and more attention over the recent years which attempts to utilize the flexibilities in the demand side to compensate the uncertainties in the supply side. Following this direction, we propose a duration-deadline jointly differentiated energy service in this paper. Specifically, we consider a group of flexible loads with each load requiring a constant power level for a specified duration before a specified deadline. A load is indifferent of the actual time of delivery as long as the duration and deadline requirements are satisfied. We first address the adequacy problem of a given supply profile which boils down to solving a (0, 1)-matrix feasibility problem. It turns out that the adequacy condition is given explicitly by the nonnegativity of a structure matrix. We also develop a market implementation of the proposed energy service and show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium."
1418655,21246,9475,Development of a large scanning-range atomic force microscope with adaptive complementary sliding mode controller,2012,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique to provide high resolution, three-dimensional data for measuring topography of samples. However, the scanning range of conventional AFM systems hardly exceeds hundreds of micrometers due to the piezoelectric actuation. In this research, we develop a large scanning-range AFM system with a z-scanner separated from the xy-scanner. The z-scanner actuated by piezoelectric stack provides high speed scanning and the homemade xy-scanner actuated by electromagnetic actuation is capable of 2 mm×2 mm large field positioning with 17 nm rms error. The overall AFM system consists of a commercial piezoelectric positioner, four sets of electromagnetic actuator, a monolithic parallel compliant mechanism, and an eddy current damper. Moreover, a compact disk/digital versatile disk pick-up-head (CD/DVD PUH) is applied to measure the amplitude of the cantilever. Furthermore, we design an adaptive complementary sliding mode controller to deal with the unknown parameters, unmodeled system uncertainties, and the external disturbances. Finally, preliminary experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed system."
1532735,21246,23712,Skewless network clock synchronization,2013,"This paper examines synchronization of computer clocks connected via a data network and proposes a skewless algorithm to synchronize them. Unlike existing solutions, which either estimate and compensate the frequency difference (skew) among clocks or introduce offset corrections that can generate jitter and possibly even backward jumps, our algorithm achieves synchronization without these problems. We first analyze the convergence property of the algorithm and provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters to guarantee synchronization. We then implement our solution on a cluster of IBM BladeCenter servers running Linux and study its performance. In particular, both analytically and experimentally, we show that our algorithm can converge in the presence of timing loops. This marks a clear contrast with current standards such as NTP and PTP, where timing loops are specifically avoided. Furthermore, timing loops can even be beneficial in our scheme. For example, it is demonstrated that highly connected subnetworks can collectively outperform individual clients when the time source has large jitter. It is also experimentally demonstrated that our algorithm outperforms other well-established software-based solutions such as the NTPv4 and IBM Coordinated Cluster Time (IBM CCT)."
1962028,21246,9475,Time-robust discrete control over networked Loosely Time-Triggered Architectures,2008,"In this paper we consider loosely time-triggered architectures (LTTA) as a networked infrastructure for deploying discrete control. LTTA are distributed architectures in which 1/ each computing unit is triggered by its own local clock, 2/ the local clocks are not synchronized, and 3/ communication is by the following principle: each communication link acts as a shared and sustained variable that can be, at will, written by the source node and read by the destination node. The loose communication medium used can cause duplication and/or loss of events, as well as distorsion of the synchronization between events occurring at different nodes of the network. While LTT architectures possess significant advantages, their use for distributed discrete control raises serious difficulties.Together with other authors, the authors of this paper have proposed a comprehensive design methodology ensuring the preservation of semantics, from specification to implementation over LTTA. This technique uses sophisticated token based protocols alike so-called elastic circuits recently introduced for asynchronous hardware.In this paper we propose a completely different approach, with no flow of token, and entirely time based. Our approach relies on upsampling and suitable use of local counters. We prove the preservation of semantics, from specification to implementation on LTTA with this technique, and we study its performance. An extended version of this paper with more results is found."
928128,21246,9475,Optimal constant splitting for efficient routing over unreliable networks,2012,"We study the question of routing for minimum average drop rate over unreliable servers that are prone to random buffer failures. Such a generic setup can be used to model scenarios of interest in unreliable data or manufacturing networks. Interestingly, we first reveal that the traditional Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) or optimal Randomized Splitting (RS) strategies are consistently outperformed by the Constant Splitting Rule (CSR) where the incoming traffic is split with a constant fraction towards the available servers. This finding motivates us to obtain the optimal splitting fraction under CSR. However, the objective function to be minimized depends on the mean queue length of the servers, whose closed-form expression is not available and often intractable for general arrival and service processes. Thus, we use non-derivative methods to solve this optimization problem by approximately evaluating the objective value at each iteration. To that end, we explicitly characterize the approximation error by utilizing the regenerating nature of unreliable buffers. By adaptively controlling the precision of this approximation, we show that our proposed algorithm converges to an optimal splitting decision in the almost sure sense."
1055741,21246,9475,Electric load forecasting in the presence of Active Demand,2012,"Active Demand (AD) is a new concept in smart grids developed within the EU project ADDRESS. It refers to the active participation of households and small commercial consumers in energy systems by means of the flexibility they can offer. Upon receiving real-time price/volume signals, consumers may find convenient to change their load profiles in return of a monetary reward. In this way, they can contribute to the provision of services to the different participants in the electricity system. Since AD causes modifications of the typical consumers' behaviour, classical load forecasting tools not considering AD signals as inputs are expected to give inaccurate results when applied to load time series including AD effects. In this paper, we study this problem by comparing the prediction performances of several linear models of the load exploiting or not AD signals as inputs. The comparison shows that enhanced prediction results can be obtained by suitably combining the use of AD inputs and the extraction of seasonal characteristics. This is demonstrated by applying the considered approaches to simulated AD effects added to real measurements, representing the aggregated load of about 60 consumers from an Italian LV network."
2047015,21246,9475,On the design of ILC schemes for finite frequency range tracking specifications,2010,"Many industrial systems perform the same task over a finite duration. For example, a robot placing objects on a conveyer where the exact sequence of operations is collect an object from a given location, transfer it over a finite time, place it on a moving conveyor and then return to the same location for the next one and so on. Iterative learning control emerged as a setting for controller design in such cases where information from previous executions, also termed trials, is used to update the control signal to be used on the next trial and thereby sequentially improve performance. Control laws designed in this setting can be activated in a number of ways, one of the most common is feedforward from the previous trial to track a specific reference signal or reject a repeating disturbance. Another option is to combine the feedforward term with feedback action on the current trial. For plants with linear dynamics, the learning filter, termed the L-filter in some of the literature, is a common approach to guarantee convergence in the trial-to-trial direction and is often combined with a robustness filter, termed the Q-filter in some literature. In this paper, we use the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma to design the L and Q filters over a finite, as opposed to the complete, frequency range which is more practically relevant in many cases."
2552389,21246,23735,Visibility-based persistent monitoring with robot teams,2015,"We study the problem of planning paths for a team of robots motivated by coverage, persistent monitoring and surveillance applications. The input is a set of target points in a polygonal environment that must be monitored using robots with omni-directional cameras. The goal is to compute paths for all robots such that every target is visible from at least one path. The cost of a path is given by the weighted combination of the length of the path (travel time) and the number of viewpoints along the path (measurement time). The overall cost is given by the maximum cost over all robot paths and the objective is to minimize the maximum cost. In its general form, this problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we present an optimal algorithm and a constant factor approximation for two special versions of the problem. In both cases, the paths are restricted to lie on a pre-defined curve in the polygon. We show that if the curve satisfies a special property, termed chain-visibility, then there exists an optimal algorithm for monitoring a given set of target locations. Furthermore, if we restrict the input polygon to the class of street polygons, then we present a constant-factor approximation which is applicable even if the set of target locations is the entire polygon. In addition to theoretical proofs, we also present results from simulation studies."
2663476,21246,9475,An IV-SVM-based approach for identification of state-space LPV models under generic noise conditions,2015,"This paper presents a nonparametric identification method for state-space linear parameter-varying (LPV) models using a modified support vector machine (SVM) approach. While most LPV identification schemes in the state-space form fall under the general category of parametric methods, regularization-based SVMs provide a viable alternative to model scheduling dependencies, without the need of specifying the dependency structure and with an attractive bias-variance trade-off. In this paper, a solution is proposed for nonparametric identification of LPV state-space models in terms of least-squares SVMs (LS-SVM) and is then extended in a way that the proposed estimation is robust to errors in the noise model estimation. The so-called instrumental variables (IV) method has been used in linear system identification for quite some time, and has recently seen its application in the identification of both nonlinear and LPV systems in the input-output (IO) form. The IV method reduces the bias in estimated LPV state-space models in case the noise model is not estimated properly or is unknown. In the proposed method of this paper, the attractive bias-variance trade-off properties of LS-SVMs are combined with statistical properties of IV-based methods to give robust estimates of the functional dependencies. Numerical examples are provided to compare the performances of the proposed IV-based technique with the LS-SVM-based LPV model identification methods."
970858,21246,9475,Wholesale energy market in a smart grid: Dynamic modeling and stability,2011,"The recent paradigm shift in the architecture of a smart grid is driven by the need to integrate renewable energy sources, the availability of information via advanced metering and communication, and an emerging policy of a demand structure that is intertwined with pricing. By using smart grid communication technologies that offer dynamic information, the ability to use electricity more efficiently and provide real-time information to utilities is expected to be significantly improved. The introduction of both renewable energy sources as well as efforts to integrate them through an information processing layer brings in dynamic interactions between the major components of a smart grid. In this paper, a dynamic model of the wholesale energy market due to the network constraints is derived. This dynamic model is fundamentally linked to one of the central features of the energy market, of optimal power flow. Beginning with a framework that includes real-time pricing, an attempt is made in this model to capture the dynamic interactions between generation, demand, locational marginal price, and congestion price near the equilibrium of the optimal dispatch. Conditions under which stability of the market can be guaranteed are derived. Numerical studies are reported to illustrate the dynamic model, and its stability properties."
2368478,21246,9475,On-line approach/landing trajectory generation with input deviation bound uncertainty for reusable launch vehicles,2007,"For next generation reusable launch vehicle (RLV) programs, a main objective is significant improvements in vehicle safety, reliability, and operational costs. Novel approaches are required in order to deliver a RLV to its landing site safely and reliably, recover the vehicle from some failures, and avoid mission abort as much as possible. One of such approaches was trajectory generation on approach and landing (A&L) for RLVs using motion primitives (MPs) and neighboring optimal control (NOC). The approach showed that a vehicle with stuck effectors could be recovered from failures in real time. In this paper, further discussion on robustness issues of the above approach is given. Based on neighboring feasible trajectory existence theorem (NFTET), a trajectory robustness theorem (TRT) is investigated and its proof is provided as well. According to TRT, a robustifying term is introduced to compensate for the effects of the linear approximation in NFTET. The upper bounds with respect to input deviation are adaptively adjusted to eliminate their uncertainty. In order to obtain best performance, sigma-modification is employed. The simulation results demonstrated excellent robust performance of this method."
2459176,21246,9475,Real-time MPC - Stability through robust MPC design,2009,"Recent results have suggested that online Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be computed quickly enough to control fast sampled systems. High-speed applications impose a hard real-time constraint on the solution of the MPC problem, which generally prevents the computation of the optimal controller. In current approaches guarantees on feasibility and stability are sacrificed in order to achieve a real-time setting. In this paper we develop a real-time MPC scheme based on robust MPC design that recovers these guarantees while allowing for extremely fast computation. We show that a simple warm-start optimization procedure providing an enhanced feasible solution guarantees feasibility and stability for arbitrary time constraints. The proposed method can be practically implemented and efficiently solved for dynamic systems of significant problem size. Implementation details for a real-time robust MPC method are provided that achieves computation times equal to those reported for methods without guarantees. A 12-dimensional problem with 3 control inputs and a prediction horizon of 10 time steps is solved in 2msec with a performance deterioration less than 1% and thereby allows for sampling rates of 500Hz."
2246383,21246,8960,An Unsupervised Decontamination Procedure For Improving The Reliability Of Human Judgments,2011,"Psychologists have long been struck by individuals' limitations in expressing their internal sensations, impressions, and evaluations via rating scales. Instead of using an absolute scale, individuals rely on reference points from recent experience. This relativity of judgment limits the informativeness of responses on surveys, questionnaires, and evaluation forms. Fortunately, the cognitive processes that map stimuli to responses are not simply noisy, but rather are influenced by recent experience in a lawful manner. We explore techniques to remove sequential dependencies, and thereby decontaminate a series of ratings to obtain more meaningful human judgments. In our formulation, the problem is to infer latent (subjective) impressions from a sequence of stimulus labels (e.g., movie names) and responses. We describe an unsupervised approach that simultaneously recovers the impressions and parameters of a contamination model that predicts how recent judgments affect the current response. We test our iterated impression inference, or II3, algorithm in three domains: rating the gap between dots, the desirability of a movie based on an advertisement, and the morality of an action. We demonstrate significant objective improvements in the quality of the recovered impressions."
1011431,21246,23735,An approach to posture control of free-falling twin bodies using differential flatness,2010,"Often, electronics and packages must be prevented from damages resulting from awkward falls. The goal of this paper is to explore how actuators and control can be used to reorient bodies during free fall. It is well known that motion of a free-falling body or a set of interconnected bodies is characterized by the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The governing angular momentum equations are nonholonomic, i.e., are non-integrable rate equations. In this paper, we assume that the falling system consists of twin bodies interconnected by a hinge joint. One of the twin bodies is designated as the primary body which needs to be reoriented during fall. The secondary body is connected to the primary body by a hinge joint, similar to a protective cover on a cell phone. The relative angle between the twin bodies is actively controlled. In addition, two rotors are mounted on the primary body with axes orthogonal to the axis of the hinge between the twin bodies. The goal of this study is to use the framework of differential flatness to compute trajectories for the hinge joint and the two rotors so that the twin bodies achieve prespecified orientations at the end of the free fall."
850084,21246,9475,Revisiting evolutionary game theory,2013,"Evolutionary game theory is a relatively young mathematical theory that aims to formalize in mathematical terms evolution models in biology. In recent years this paradigm has penetrated more and more into other areas such as the linguistics, economics and engineering. The current theory of evolutionary game makes an implicit assumption that the evolution is driven by selfishness of individuals who interact with each others. In mathematical terms this can be stated as “an individual equals a player in a game model”. This assumption turns out to be quite restrictive in modeling evolution in biology. It is now more and more accepted among biologist that the evolution is driven by the selfish interests of large groups of individuals; a group may correspond for example to a whole beehive or to an ants' nest. In this paper we propose an alternative paradigm for modeling evolution where a player does not necessarily represent an interacting individual but a whole class of such individuals."
3005488,21246,9475,Optimal allocation of metabolic functions among organisms in a microbial ecosystem,2016,"We formulate a resource allocation problem of interest to microbial ecology and to the emerging area of synthetic ecology. We consider a given number of microbial species symbiotically living in a community and a list of all metabolic reactions present in the community, expressed in terms of the metabolite proportions involved in each reaction. We are interested in allocating reactions to organisms so that each organism maintains a minimal level of growth and the community optimizes certain objectives, such as maximizing growth and/or the uptake of specific compounds from the common environment. We leverage Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem. We test our method in a toy model involving two organisms that can only survive through cross-feeding, demonstrating that the method can recover this interaction. We also test the method in a community of two simplified bacteria described in terms of their core, simplified metabolic network. We demonstrate that the method can obtain syntrophic cross-feeding species that would be very difficult to design manually."
1713899,21246,9475,Touchscreen crane control interfaces with oscillation suppression,2013,It is often very difficult for human operators to control cranes due to their slow responses and lightly-damped payload swing. The control task is made even harder by awkward control interfaces. Portable touchscreen devices offer the opportunity to improve the control interface by replacing traditional push-button pendent and joystick-based controllers. This paper presents several classes of touchscreen interfaces that are coupled with an oscillation-supressing control system. Some interfaces are further augmented with a rotating reference frame of control that changes the control directions based on the direction that the touchscreen controller is pointing. Results from operator studies demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the interfaces and compares them with a traditional push-button pendent.

2948374,21246,9475,A min-min approach to non-blind and blind parameter estimation under admissibility and domination constraints,2016,"In this work, we develop min-min type of biased estimators for the deterministic parameter vector in a linear regression model under the condition that an ellipsoidal prior knowledge is either available or is inferred from the measurements, leading to the non-blind and blind designs, respectively. As the design specifications for the former, from which the latter is developed, domination over the least-squares (LS) estimator with respect to all weighted mean-squared error (MSE) measures and the corresponding admissibility condition are ensured. The blind counterpart of this solution is then built based on an ellipsoidal set that is estimated from the LS approach. This nonlinear estimator admits a closed-form solution and is proved to outperform the LS estimator under a wide range of conditions. Numerical comparisons of the developed non-blind solution, referred to as the constrained min-min (CMM) estimator, to alternatives demonstrate the superior weighted MSE performance of our solution when the true parameters are not nearby the boundary of the ellipsoid. On the other hand, as the case with all blind approaches, the blind CMM (BCMM) estimator is also more likely to have a major improvement over the LS estimator in problems of relatively high dimension. When compared to existing blind approaches, the BCMM estimator is more preferable when various weighted MSE measures are taken into account in the performance evaluation."
1180950,21246,8494,The roles of small-world and degree heterogeneity on evolutionary behavior networks,2010,"This paper studies the roles of small-world and degree heterogeneity features on the behavioral diversity in a structured population. The findings conclude that the collective behaviors are prone to the much higher diversity in a homogeneous structure due to the small-world effect, yet they are affected little in a scale-free structure. And the degree heterogeneity promotes the behavioral diversity a little while the population structure is homogeneous, but inhibits diversity while it is scale-free. Our work may be helpful for better understanding the collective evolutionary dynamic behaviors in a homogeneous or scale-free structured population."

By breaking the data dependencies through a re-organization of calculations, an almost completely parallel algorithm is obtained. Analysis of the resulting algorithm brings about an estimate of the memory bandwidth necessary for a linear in the number of cores speedup. An evaluation of the parallel algorithm on two different shared-memory multicore architectures has been performed. It is found that linear speedup in the number of used cores can indeed be achieved provided a sufficient memory bandwidth is offered by the hardware."

In our model, microgrids with excessive power generations can trade with other microgrids in deficit of power supplies for mutual benefits. We design a bargaining-based energy trading market, where all the interconnected microgrids cooperatively decide the amount of energy trade and the associated payments. We propose a decentralized algorithm to solve the bargaining problem, with minimum information exchange overhead. Numerical studies based on realistic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the bargaining-based energy trading market design, and show that the reduction of total cost of the interconnected-microgrids system can be up to 22% comparing with the case of no trading."
2984369,21246,9475,Analysis of difficulty in estimating physically-meaningful model parameters based on normalized parameter sensitivity plot,2015,"In this paper, a new approach for analyzing the degree of the difficulty in estimating parameters is proposed. The approach targets at linear continuous-time models with physically-meaningful parameters and is based on the newly introduced normalized parameter sensitivity plot. The plot illustrates how the identification inputs contribute to the estimation accuracy in frequency domain and visualize the relative relationship between the model sensitivities for the parameters. In the paper, it is proven that there is a practically important accuracy limitation derived from the relative relationship. And the proposed plot enables to evaluate the limitation in a visual way. To show the applicability of the theoretical discussion in practical situations, a numerical experiment based on a mechanical system model is presented. And, a model of a rechargeable battery for electric vehicles is analyzed by the proposed approach to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach in devising strategies for estimating model parameters and selecting model structures."
2930831,21246,9475,Generalized composite adaptive IMC: Design and analysis,2016,"Internal model control (IMC), which explicitly incorporates a plant model and a plant inverse as its components, has an intuitive control structure and simple tuning philosophy, making it appealing to industrial applications. Combining the IMC structure with adaptation through the certainty equivalence principle leads to adaptive IMC (AIMC), where the plant model is identified and the plant inverse is derived by inverting the estimated model. In [1], [2], we proposed the composite adaptive IMC (CAIMC) for a first-order plant and successfully applied it to the boost-pressure control problem of a turbocharged gasoline engine system. Within the IMC control structure, the plant model and the plant inverse are simultaneously identified to minimize modeling errors and further reduce the tracking error. Through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental validation, CAIMC was shown to demonstrate better performance compared to AIMC. In this paper the design procedure of CAIMC is generalized to a n-th order plant, and stability and asymptotic performance are established and analyzed under proper conditions."

This type of ensemble control systems appears in various application domains, such as the manipulation of quantum spin ensembles and motion planning for a population of robots. We establish an explicit algebraic necessary and sufficient condition to examine the controllability of systems on SO(n) by using the terminology from the theory of symmetric groups, which provides a transparent means to analyze the underlying Lie algebras. In addition, we show the equivalence between controllability and ensemble controllability of individual and ensemble systems, respectively, for systems evolving on SO(n)."

The clocks need neither be synchronized nor have the same speed. The main idea is to let nodes adjust the weights on outgoing links to compensate for their update speed: the higher the update frequency, the smaller the link weights. Our mechanism is used to develop a distributed algorithm for computing the PageRank vector, commonly used to assign importance to web pages and rank search results. Although several distributed approaches in the literature can deal with asynchronism, they cannot handle the different update speeds that occur when servers have heterogeneous computational capabilities. When existing algorithms are executed using heterogeneous update speeds, they compute incorrect PageRank values. The advantages of our algorithm over existing approaches are verified through illustrative examples."
3005686,21246,9475,Distributed partitioning strategies with visual optimization for camera network perimeter patrolling,2016,"This work addresses the boundary patrolling problem, where a smart camera network undertakes the task of monitoring the perimeter of an environment so as to detect anomalies and track possible intrusions. Here, a distributed solution is sought based on the definition of a suitable functional that accounts both for the equitable partitioning of the available space and for the quality of vision of the patrolled area, and admits a unique optimal solution. The optimization of such functional leads to the design of an algorithm relying on a symmetric gossip communication protocol among the neighboring cameras. The theoretical results prove the correctness of the approach and the numerical simulations on a realistic scenario confirm its validity."
1230924,21246,8441,Robust geometric formation control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles with time delays,2013,"This paper develops a robust controller for autonomous underwater vehicles with bounded time delays, so that the AUVs form and keep a desired formation shape and track a desired trajectory. We use a six-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for each AUV to describe its motions in the three-dimensional space. We design an orientation controller based on feedback linearization, so that the orientation of each AUV converges to its desired value. We derive formation dynamics of AUVs and decouple the dynamics into a formation shape and a formation center, using the Jacobi transform. We treat couplings in the formation dynamics as perturbations and design a robust formation-keeping controller to tolerate both the perturbations and the time delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our controller in simulations."
2930592,21246,9475,"Viable set approximation for linear-Gaussian systems with unknown, bounded variance",2016,"Computation of stochastic reachable and viable sets enables assurances of safety and feasibility through the synthesis of optimal control policies. These control policies are typically generated under the assumption of accurate characterization of additive noise processes. We consider the case in which independent noise processes are not fully characterized. Specifically, we consider linear time-invariant dynamics with additive noise, with known mean and bounded (but unknown) variance. We propose a method to compute a conservative underapproximation to the stochastic viable set for problems with convex viable and target sets. We underapproximate probability values through linear transformation based on bounds on the unknown variance. We demonstrate this method (via dynamic programming) on a simple example."
2930731,21246,9475,Lyapunov descriptions of robust output stability for systems with delays,2016,"There are several notions of output stability that are intrinsically different. We present in this work a Lyapunov characterization for the so called robust output Lagrange stability for nonlinear delay systems. This output stability property requires that the overshoots of the output variables be bounded by the magnitudes of their initial values. As in the case for systems without delays, it is expected that the results in this work will lead to equivalent Lyapunov characterizations for several input-to-output stability properties. Furthermore, for delay systems, the notion of Lyapunov functions extends to Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, and some new features arise in the decay estimations of these functionals. In this work our objective is to provide equivalent Lyapunov descriptions for robust output Lagrange stability in terms of different types of decay estimations."

In this paper, a stability theorem via PLFs is presented for T-S models, and it is shown that stability can be established via linear programming. Furthermore, nonconvex stabilization conditions are stated that, if satisfied, specify a parallel distributed compensation (PDC) controller as well as a PLF which proves stability of the closed loop system. An algorithm is presented as an initial step in working around the nonconvex stabilization conditions, and has shown to be useful in the computation of PDC controllers."
2996298,21246,9475,On the identification of FIR systems with binary input and output observations,2016,"This paper considers the identification of FIR systems, where the inputs and outputs of the system undergoes quantization into binary values before transmission to the system identifier. Provided that the thresholds of the input and output quantizers can be adapted, we propose identification schemes which are strongly consistent for Gaussian distributed inputs and noises. Identification schemes are given both for the case where the mean and variance of the input distribution are known, and when they are unknown."
936902,21246,8441,"Pursuit, herding and evasion: A three-agent model of caribou predation",2013,"Motivated by problems of pursuit and evasion in coordinated multi-agent systems, we present a model of pursuit, herding and evasion for three agents: a single pursuer, e.g. a bear, chooses a target point along the line connecting two evaders, and the two evaders, e.g. a mother caribou and her calf, each choose a strategy that trades off evasion and herding. The model is based on feedback control of constant speed steered particles on the plane. Dynamics over a reduced set of shape variables are defined. Parallel-motion shape equilibria are studied, with stability analysis and analytic solutions provided for special cases in the parameter space. Simulation results are also presented that suggest existence of optimal strategies for the bear and the caribou in a game theoretic sense."
2930825,21246,9475,Spreading control of sub-diffusion processes,2016,"Inspired by many real-world applications, this paper is concerned with the concept of spreadability for a class of sub-diffusion processes. The spreading control problems of sub-diffusion processes are formulated. An approach to guarantee the existence of solution to the adaptive spreading control problem based on the regional control results is proposed. We also introduce a new equivalence of the solution for the time fractional diffusion system to support the proof of our obtained results."
2935829,21246,9475,LQG control with minimum directed information,2016,"We consider a framework of LQG optimal control in which Massey's directed information from the state sequence to the control sequence is minimized. The use of directed information in this study is motivated by the data-rate minimization in quantized LQG control. We show that an optimal control policy in our framework can be realized by a simple three-stage architecture comprising (i) a linear sensor with additive Gaussian noise, (ii) a Kalman filter, and (iii) a certainty equivalence controller. This result can be viewed as an integration of two previously known separation theorems: the filter-controller separation theorem in the standard LQG control theory, and the sensor-filter separation theorem that arises in zero-delay rate-distortion theory for Gauss-Markov sources. A tractable computational algorithm based on semidefinite programming is proposed to synthesize an optimal policy."
2101819,21246,8960,Online Learning of Dynamic Parameters in Social Networks,2013,"This paper addresses the problem of online learning in a dynamic setting. We consider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal about the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at each time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter in a finite time."
2946197,21246,9475,Distributed minimum weighted norm solution to linear equations associated with weighted inner product,2016,"In this paper, we propose a distributed method to find the solution of the linear equations Ax = b with minimum energy, i.e. the minimum weighted norm associated with the weighted inner product. We first prove that for a special case when the norm is two-norm, the algorithm can make multiple agents reach the minimum two-norm solution of the global linear equations Ax = b if the agents are initialized at the minimum two-norm solutions of their local equations. We then prove that if there are bounded initialization errors, the final convergence of the algorithm is also bounded away from the minimum two-norm solution of the global linear equations. Next, we prove the case with the two-norm replaced with a weighted norm associated with the weighted inner product. Finally, simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the results in this paper."
1643357,21246,8441,On active vibration suppression of a piezoelectric beam,2013,"Piezoelectric beam's dynamics are characterized by elastic properties, nonlinearities, uncertain dynamics and unknown disturbances, making it a challenging control problem. In this paper, a method of Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) for piezoelectric beam control is proposed. Unique to this approach, the complex piezoelectric beam dynamics, known or unknown, linear or nonlinear, and all external disturbances are treated in their totality as an input disturbance, and is subsequently estimated and canceled. Simulation and experimental results in this paper demonstrate the significant advancement of the ADRC as an easier, simpler and better control method that is ready to be deployed in practice."

The infinite-zero- and finite-invariant-zero-structure of these dynamics are characterized explicitly in terms of the network's graph matrix, using the special coordinate basis for linear system. These algebraic characterizations are then used to identify relationships between features of the network's graph topology and the state matrix of its finite zero dynamics."
2072241,21246,8441,Reconstruction of directed networks from consensus dynamics,2013,"This paper addresses the problem of identifying the topology of an unknown, weighted, directed network running a consensus dynamics. We propose a methodology to reconstruct the network topology from the dynamic response when the system is stimulated by a wide-sense stationary noise of unknown power spectral density. The method is based on a node-knockout, or grounding, procedure wherein the grounded node broadcasts zero without being eliminated from the network. In this direction, we measure the empirical cross-power spectral densities of the outputs between every pair of nodes for both grounded and ungrounded consensus to reconstruct the unknown topology of the network. We also establish that in the special cases of undirected and purely unidirectional networks, the reconstruction does not need grounding. Finally, we extend our results to the case of a directed network assuming a general dynamics, and prove that the developed method can detect edges and their direction."
1300083,21246,8441,Efficient deterministic dirac mixture approximation of Gaussian distributions,2013,"We propose an efficient method for approximating arbitrary Gaussian densities by a mixture of Dirac components. This approach is based on the modification of the classical Cramer-von Mises distance, which is adapted to the multivariate scenario by using Localized Cumulative Distributions (LCDs) as a replacement for the cumulative distribution function. LCDs consider the local probabilistic influence of a probability density around a given point. Our modification of the Cramer-von Mises distance can be approximated for certain special cases in closed-form. The created measure is minimized in order to compute the positions of the Dirac components for a standard normal distribution."
3048901,21246,9475,Dissipativity-based switching adaptive control,2009,"This paper presents a new switching adaptive control strategy for nonlinear systems with uncertainties on discrete finite sets. Differently to multiple model supervisory control, switching adaptive control needs no estimators for switching decisions. The switching logic is designed based on the relationship between passivity (or more generally dissipativity) and the adaptive systems, such that in the process of switching control, the transient boundary can be guaranteed by appropriately switching the parameter estimate. This makes it possible to apply the strategy in nonlinear systems modelled in local regions in the state space. Simulation will be employed to show the effectiveness of the approach."
1389869,21246,9078,Consensus-based distributed estimation in camera networks,2012,"Distributed algorithms in the sensors networks community usually require each sensor to have its own measurement. In practice, this constraint can not always be met. For example, in a camera network, all cameras might not observe a particular target as cameras are directional sensors and have a limited field-of-view (FOV). Moreover, different sensors might provide different quality measures related to different elements of the measurement vector depending on various factors as directionality, occlusion etc. This requires the designing of a new type of distributed algorithm that considers the quality and/or absence of measurements. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of the state of a target viewed by the network of cameras, taking into account the above-mentioned factors. We provide step-by-step derivation along with theoretical guarantee of optimality and convergence of the method. Experimental results are provided to show the performance of the proposed algorithm."

The identification is done using a recently published subspace identification (SID) algorithm [1] for LPV systems. The objective is to demonstrate the ability of this method to not only identify a highly accurate model in state space form, but to also determine the state order of the system. As the identification data are gained from simulation, a comparison is given between the noiseless and the noisy case, and the effects of noise especially on the model order estimation are discussed."
1132650,21246,8441,Nonlinear filtering with transfer operator,2013,"This paper presents a new nonlinear filtering algorithm that is shown to outperform state-of-the-art particle filters with resampling. Starting from the Itô stochastic differential equation, the proposed algorithm harnesses Karhunen-Loeve expansion to derive an approximate non-autonomous dynamical system, for which transfer operator based density computation can be performed in exact arithmetic. It is proved that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent in mean-square sense. Numerical results demonstrate that explicitly accounting prior dynamics entail significant performance improvement for nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problems with infrequent measurement updates, as compared to the performance of particle filters."

The focus is first on the extension of the refined IV method for continuous-time model identification to the frequency domain. Then, an iterative IV scheme coupled with an appropriate frequency localising basis function is developed to provide consistent results in the case of highly resonant wide-band systems. Finally, to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach, a representative Monte Carlo simulation as well as a practical case are presented."
1330768,21246,8441,Global trajectory tracking for a class of underactuated vehicles,2013,"In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory tracking for a class of underactuated vehicles with full torque actuation and only one dimensional force actuation (thrust). For this class of vehicles, the desired thrust is defined by a saturated control law that achieves global asymptotic stabilization of the position tracking error. The proposed control law also assures that the third component of the angular velocity is regulated to zero. To accomplish this task we propose a hybrid controller that is designed using backstepping techniques and recent developments on synergistic Lyapunov functions. Simulations validating the results are also provided."
639487,21246,8441,Joint leader and link weight selection for fast convergence in multi-agent systems,2013,"Multi-agent system protocols, such as consensus and formation control, require agents to converge rapidly to their desired states. Smooth convergence is achieved through selection of leader nodes (in leader-follower systems) or choosing optimal link weights (in leader-less systems). In this paper, we introduce a framework for minimizing convergence time through optimization of joint leader and link weight selection for a class of systems that include leader-follower and leader-less systems as special cases. We present a semidefinite programming approach for two problems: first, the problem of selecting a fixed number of leaders and the corresponding link weights in order to minimize the convergence time, and second, the problem of selecting the minimum number of leaders and corresponding link weights to achieve a bound on the convergence time. We prove that our approach is equivalent to classical results in discrete location theory, with provable optimality gaps, under special cases. Our results are illustrated through numerical simulations."

We propose a novel numerical solution approach for systematic computation of optimal nonlinear leader functions, also known as incentives, for reverse Stackelberg games with incomplete information and general, nonconcave utility functions. In particular, we apply basis function approximation to the class of nonlinear leader functions, and treat the incentive design problem as a standard semi-infinite programming problem. A worked example is provided to illustrate the proposed solution approach and to demonstrate its efficiency."
1879441,21246,8441,"Output synchronization for heterogeneous networks of non-introspective, non-right-invertible agents",2013,"We consider the output synchronization problem for a heterogeneous network of linear agents. The agents are non-introspective, meaning that they do not have access to their own state or output; the only information available to each agent comes from the network, in the form of a linear combination of its output relative to that of neighboring agents. The basis for our study is a design previously presented by the authors, which was based on an additional assumption requiring the agents to be right-invertible. Here we dispense with the assumption of right-invertibility and instead introduce a new assumption based on solvability of a particular set of regulator equations."
2946158,21246,9475,Consistent event-triggered methods for linear quadratic control,2016,"In this paper, we define two desired consistency properties for event-triggered control: (i) it should result in a better trade-off between average transmission rate and close-dloop performance than traditional periodic control; (ii) it should require no sensor updates (i.e., operate in open loop) in the absence of disturbances. We propose an event-triggered controller for linear systems with full state feedback that guarantees these two properties when performance is measured by an average quadratic cost. Simulation results highlight the efficiency of the proposed solution."
2966969,21246,9475,A new LMI condition for robust stability of polynomial matrix polytopes,2002,"A sufficient condition for checking the robust stability of a polytope of polynomial matrices is proposed. A simple feasibility test performed in a convex set of linear matrix inequalities defined at the vertices of the polytope yields sufficient conditions for the robust stability of the entire domain. Both continuous-time (left half-plane) and discrete-time stability (unit disk) are investigated. Numerical comparisons with quadratic stability results and with another method recently appeared in the literature show that the conditions proposed provide, in general, less conservative results."

System supports to calculate distortion measurement of voiceprint without disclosing the raw voiceprint data under the telebiometric functional model in the open network. The client contributes encrypted voiceprint data to the system, where components can perform queries and matching without decrypting the data in order to keep the security of biometrics. According to the analysis of theory, the proposal is secured because the voiceprint templates are diverse, cancelable and irreversible if the security parameters are secret.

The new driving mode is used in the active gastrointestinal examination robot system, which is a novel and meaningful attempt. In this paper, for the operation mechanism and movement characteristics of capsubot, a new type of electromagnetic driver has been designed. The driver is optimized and analyzed by magnetic circuit method and finite element method. Then we manufacture the prototype of the capsubot.

The challenge comes from how to deal with the potential wide variation in workloads. The paper constructs a content-based Pub/Sub service named OPS4Cloud on the top of cloud infrastructure from scratch. OPS4Cloud manages its brokers by regions and presents a VM-based region adjustment strategy. It builds two-level indexes at brokers to speed up the routing of subscriptions, events and advertisements on the basis of channelization routing. It also designs a mechanism for subscription persistence, accelerating the load transfer. The paper conducts extensive experiments on OPS4Cloud, especially in comparison with the migrated Pub/Sub systems. The experimental data shows that OPS4Cloud is vastly superior to the migrated systems in terms of system throughput and event response time, and it also tends towards a load-balancing state among brokers while running continuously."

A critical aspect of swarm control, especially in disrupted or degraded conditions, is Soldier-swarm interaction-the Soldier must be kept cognizant of swarm operations through an interface that allows him or her to monitor status and/or institute corrective actions. We provide a control method for the swarm that adapts easily to changing battlefield conditions, metrics and supervisory algorithms that enable swarm members to economically monitor changes in swarm status as they execute the mission, and display concepts that can efficiently and effectively communicate swarm status to Soldiers in challenging battlefield environments."
1600121,21246,8441,Reconstruction of directed acyclic networks of dynamical systems,2013,"Determining the relation structure of various interconnected entities from multiple time series data is of significant interest to many areas. Knowledge of such a structure can aid in identifying cause and effect relationships, clustering of similar entities, detecting representative elements for an aggregate and determining reduced order models. Current methods tend to treat observations in a static manner by modeling the measured time series as repeated realizations of as many random variables that are independent over time. This amounts to assume static relationships among the measurements, making these techniques ill-suited for detecting propagative and dynamic phenomena that can be fundamental for the understanding of the system. In this paper we extend techniques for the identification of networks of random variables connected through static relations to the case of random processes with dynamic relations. This is achieved by showing that the Wiener filter defines a relationship among jointly stationary stochastic processes that has the properties of a semi-graphoid."
2726888,21246,8228,L0.5-regularization based distributed channel estimation for industrial wireless sensor network,2015,"In wireless communication, channel state information (CSI) is essential for receivers to correctly demodulate the signal from transmitters. The performance of wireless sensor network is significantly affected by accuracy of channel estimation, which is obtained by exciting the channel with a probing sequence and decoding the impulse response of receivers. Considering the sparsity of response, compressive sensing theory can be applied to decrease the sampling rates at the receivers, who recover the commonly detected CSI by solving the Lp-regularization. Hence, a distributed multipath channel estimation (DMCE) approach is proposed here, utilizing iterative half thresholding algorithm to solve the L0.5-regularization. Distributed cooperation reduces iteration times by allocating the computation burden to multiple sensors, whose spatial diversity reduces error of estimation from the noisy measurements. Simulation results shows the efficiency, effectiveness and promotion in sparsity than L1-regularization and non-cooperative scheme of our approach."
1937689,21246,8494,On reduced complexity IIR adaptive filters,2005,"Reduced complexity IIR adaptive filters, like Laguerre adaptive filters with pole updating are being considered as an alternative to full adaptive IIR schemes. On the other hand, low complexity realizations exist that allow a better compromise between filter-order and modeling performance. We discuss, in this work, characteristics and properties of a reduced complexity IIR orthogonal realization that improve on those of the Laguerre and sub-optimal IIR counterparts. After reviewing the Laguerre and sub-optimal adaptive filters with pole updating, we introduce a reduced complexity IIR adaptive filter based on the Steiglitz-McBride method. The particular realization proposed is based on a generalized orthonormal family of functions. The Steitglitz-McBride method is discussed mainly because it can avoid the local minima problem related to direct mean squared output error minimization. Computer simulations are given to illustrate the good performance of the proposed adaptive IIR filter with respect to computational complexity and modeling capability if compared with its Laguerre counterpart."
199739,21246,8228,Interaction between a content provider and a service provider and its efficiency,2015,"We study the interaction between a service provider (SP) and a content provider (CP) when the SP can provide higher quality-of-service (QoS) to content service under a private agreement with the CP. We model the interaction between the providers both as a Stackelberg game and as a two-person bargaining problem in order to understand how the relative bargaining power of these providers affects the resulting QoS and social efficiency. Our findings suggest that the social efficiency is identical under both the two-person bargaining problem model and the Stackelberg game model regardless of which provider is the leader with a stronger bargaining position. In addition, we prove that, under a mild technical condition, the QoS at Nash equilibrium and Nash bargaining solution improves as the contract duration increases."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first frequency domain interpretation of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport. It is shown that the asymptotic  2 W 2  can be written as functions of the ℌ 2  norms of the system gains, which have intuitive meaning. A geometric interpretation for this newly derived frequency-domain formula is given. The geometric interpretation helps us in comparing Wasserstein distance with classical frequency-domain validation metrics like υ-gap."
1495585,21246,8441,Mixed-strategy chance constrained optimal control,2013,"This paper presents a novel chance constrained optimal control (CCOC) algorithm that chooses a control action probabilistically. A CCOC problem is to find a control input that minimizes the expected cost while guaranteeing that the probability of violating a set of constraints is below a user-specified threshold. We show that a probabilistic control approach, which we refer to as a mixed control strategy, enables us to obtain a cost that is better than what deterministic control strategies can achieve when the CCOC problem is nonconvex. The resulting mixed-strategy CCOC problem turns out to be a convexification of the original nonconvex CCOC problem. Furthermore, we also show that a mixed control strategy only needs to “mix” up to two deterministic control actions in order to achieve optimality. Building upon an iterative dual optimization, the proposed algorithm quickly converges to the optimal mixed control strategy with a user-specified tolerance."

We generalize the Jurdjevic-Quinn control strategy to such mean-field equations to achieve stability in a suitable sense. For instance, in the context of crowds, consensus or alignment of agents are among the most relevant goals and they correspond to stability to a suitable manifold. Our main result is the definition of a Jurdjevic-Quinn strategy that is sparse, i.e. that acts on a small set of the configuration space at each time. We show that such a stabilization strategy can be adapted to achieve alignment of the kinetic Cucker-Smale model with a sparse control only."
732529,21246,8441,On new characterizations of social influence in social networks,2013,"We propose new characterizations of social influence, which quantify both the transient and the steady-state propagation of beliefs across society. These characterizations are used to optimally choose a desired number of agents in a social network to serve as social leaders with maximal social impact. We then consider a framework for optimally creating new social links subject to resource constraints, in order to improve the influence of designated agents or social leaders. We show that the formulated optimization problems are convex with respect to the individual elements of the optimization variables. This motivates the use of the coordinate descent method, a simple but efficient algorithm well-suited to large-scale optimization problems. Finally, using demonstrative examples, we compare the ability of our proposed characterizations of social influence in identifying the most influential agents with that of other measures of influence developed in the social networks literature."

The human decisions in these tasks are conditioned by the provision of certain rewards after each taken decision. Our modeling approach allows us to use symbolic analysis techniques to verify or design reward structures guaranteeing that the process of decision making respects pre-specified temporal properties. More importantly, it enables the study of properties going beyond the asymptotic behavior of the decision process. The proposed approach could prove useful to facilitate the interaction of a human user learning to interact with smart machines."

The microgrid is modeled as a multi-agent system and the power sharing problem is formulated as an interconnected leader-following consensus problem in the sense that the leader is affected by the fol- lowers passively. To solve this interconnected leader-following consensus problem, a distributed control scheme is proposed. First, each distributed generator is equipped with a distributed observer to communicate with each other and agree on a global reference signal, based on which the local reference power output is determined in proportion to its power capacity. Second, local tracking controller is designed for each distributed generator to achieve local reference power output tracking. It is proven that, under this control scheme, power sharing among all the distributed generators can be accomplished autonomously. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme."

A distributed control scheme is presented that exploits the interaction between neighboring stations. A local controller is attached to each station; these local controllers exchange information with neighboring controllers, in order to reduce the error in beam energy at a given station by coordinated control action across neighboring stations.

Quaternions are used to represent the attitude of the vehicle to ensure the global attitude tracking without singularities. Since the quaternions have their own unique algebra, they cannot be filtered by a vector-based command filter; therefore, a second-order quaternion filter is developed to filter the quaternion and automatically compute its derivative, which determines the commanded angular rate vector. A quadrotor vehicle is used as an example to show the performance of the proposed controller."
1425065,21246,9475,Two-dimensional analysis of string stability of nonlinear vehicle strings,2013,Stability of nonlinear 2D continuous-discrete systems is shown using Lyapunov stability theory and iISS. The proposed stability conditions are applicable with non-positive divergence of the Lyapunov function. The results are used to rigorously prove string stability of a nonlinear vehicle string with variable time headway.
725650,21246,9475,New rollover index for detection of tripped and un-tripped rollovers,2011,"Accurate detection of the danger of an impending rollover is necessary for active vehicle rollover prevention. A real-time rollover index is an indicator used for this purpose. A traditional rollover index utilizes lateral acceleration measurements and can detect only un-tripped rollovers that happen due to high lateral acceleration from a sharp turn. It fails to detect tripped rollovers that happen due to tripping from external inputs such as forces when a vehicle strikes a curb or a road bump. Therefore, this paper develops a new rollover index that can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers. The new rollover index utilizes vertical accelerometers in addition to a lateral accelerometer and is able to predict rollover in spite of unknown external inputs acting on the system. The accuracy of the developed rollover index is evaluated with experimental tests on a 1/8th scaled vehicle. The experimental results show that the new rollover index can reliably detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers."
1593152,21246,8228,Delay-power tradeoff of max queue-weighted (MWQ) power control for wireless systems with limited renewable energy storage,2012,"In this paper, we analyze the fundamental power-delay tradeoff in point-to-point wireless communication systems with renewable energy source. We consider the max queue-weighted (MWQ) algorithm, where the transmitter determines the rate and power control actions based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the data queue state information (DQSI) and renewable energy storage information (RESI). We exploit a general fluid dynamics of the data queue and renewable energy storage buffer using continuous time dynamic equations. Using the sample-path approach and renewal theory, we decompose the average delay in terms of multiple unfinished works along a sample path, and obtain bounds for the average delay and AC power consumption under the MWQ algorithm, which are asymptotically tight at small delay regime. We show that despite the randomness of the renewable energy arrival and energy buffer size, the average AC power (P) of the MWQ policy is given by P = O(D exp(1/D)) at small delay D regime. We also quantify the impacts of the renewable energy storage size in the scaling coefficient."
1458495,21246,8494,Bifurcations in simple genetic cyclic models,2010,"In order to describe genetic regulatory networks several deterministic models based on systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been proposed. The Elowitz repressilator, modeled as a system of three genes that repress each other in a ring, is one of the most outstanding examples. Furthermore, systems that can display a coexistence of different stable attractors are widely exploited in systems biology in order to suitably model the differentiating processes arising in living cells. The aim of the manuscript is to investigate the global periodic oscillations and their bifurcations in networks composed of simple bio-inspired oscillators that have a stable limit cycle and equilibrium point, separated by an unstable limit cycle."
1641015,21246,8441,RF source-seeking by a micro aerial vehicle using rotation-based angle of arrival estimates,2013,"We investigate a computationally and memory efficient algorithm for radio frequency (RF) source-seeking with a single-wing rotating micro aerial vehicle (MAV) equipped with a directional antenna. The MAV is assumed to have no knowledge of its position and to have only an estimate of orientation through a magnetometer. A key novelty of our approach is in exploiting the rotation of the MAV and the directionality of its RF antenna to derive estimates of the angle of arrival (AOA) at each rotation. The MAV then follows the estimated direction until the next rotation is complete. We prove convergence of this greedy algorithm under rather weak assumptions on the noise associated with the AOA estimates, using recent results on the property of recurrence for systems governed by stochastic difference inclusions. These convergence results are supplemented by simulations quantifying the amount of excess travel, relative to the straight line distance to the source. Indoor experiments using Lockheed Martin's Samarai MAV demonstrate the efficacy of the greedy algorithm both for static source-seeking, and for the more challenging problem of tracking a moving source."
2946038,21246,9475,A physical parameter-based skidding model for the snakeboard,2016,"The physical violation of a nonholonomic system's idealized constraints in the form of skidding has recently elucidated interest in new models in order to directly incorporate the phenomenon into the system dynamics. However, such models either are too simple to capture physical attributes or have otherwise been tested only on systems with simple behaviors, such as the rolling disk. In this work, we present a novel skidding model, based on physical parameters, for a snakeboard system, which is simultaneously rich in behavior but simple in design. This model extends the system's configuration space and associates traction forces to a skidding angle using an experimentally verified observation from the literature. We validate our model in simulation and discuss its advantages over the Rayleigh dissipation function skidding model. We also show that the model accurately predicts a physical system's behavior in experimentation with tuned parameters and standard controllers."
708201,21246,8441,Characterization of hard limits on performance of autocatalytic pathways,2013,"In this paper, we develop some basic principles to study autocatalytic networks and exploit their structural properties in order to characterize their existing hard limits and essential tradeoffs. In a dynamical system with autocatalytic structure, the system's output is necessary to catalyze its own production. We consider a simplified model of glycolysis as our motivating example. We study the hard limits of the ideal performance of such pathways. First, for a simple two-state model of glycolysis we explicitly derive the hard limit on the minimum L 2 -gain disturbance attenuation and the hard limit of its minimum output energy. Then, we generalize our results to higher dimensional model of autocatalytic pathways. Finally, we show that how these resulting hard limits lead to some fundamental tradeoffs between transient and steady-state behavior of the network and its net production."
1432663,21246,8441,Reaching consensus in the sense of probability,2013,"This paper studies consensus for a team of networked agents with stochastic interactions. Specifically, consensus in the sense of probability is investigated for both fixed and switching interaction graphs that are chosen randomly from some given set. In the static case, a lower bound for the probability of consensus is calculated when each interaction graph is equally likely to be selected among set containing all possible undirected graphs. It is then shown that the (exact) probability of consensus for n agents is strictly increasing with respect to n, whenever n ≥ 3. For the case of a randomly switching directed interaction graph, the probability of consensus is equal to the probability of an event that is critical for reaching consensus under a deterministic setting. In addition, the equivalence of consensus 1) with probability 1, 2) in probability, and 3) in the r-th mean is demonstrated without requiring an i.i.d. process and linear system dynamics."
723551,21246,8441,Scaled Minimum Unscented Multiple Hypotheses Mixing Filter,2013,"This work brings two new contributions. First, it introduces the Scaled Minimum Unscented Multiple Hypotheses Mixing Filter, a novel filter for hybrid dynamical systems that 1) uses a new minimum set of sigma points along with the scaled unscented transform in a hybrid framework; 2) can estimate the Markovian Transition Probability Matrix in real-time; 3) features a pruning step that reduces the filter's computational effort and prevents its estimates from being degraded by very unlikely hypotheses; and 4) has a mixing step with merging depth greater than one. Second, we present a result revealing the conservativeness of one of the scaled unscented transform forms."
2334364,21246,9475,Performance limitations in autocatalytic networks in biology,2010,"Autocatalytic networks, where a member can stimulate its own production, can be unstable when not controlled by feedback. Even when such networks are stabilized by regulating control feedbacks, they tend to exhibit non-minimum phase behavior. In this paper, we study the hard limits of the ideal performance of such networks and the hard limit of their minimum output energy. We consider a simplified model of glycolysis as our motivating example. For the glycolysis model, we characterize hard limits on the minimum output energy by analyzing the limiting behavior of the optimal cheap control problem for two different interconnection topologies. We show that some network interconnection topologies result in zero hard limits. Then, we develop necessary tools and concepts to extend our results to a general class of autocatalytic networks."
2978628,21246,9475,Perfect single device absorber of arbitrary traveling single photon fields with a tunable coupling parameter: A QSDE approach,2016,"We describe an ideal tuneable input-output open quantum system, realizable as either a single qubit or single resonator system, which can perfectly absorb traveling single photon states of arbitrary temporal profiles. That is, the system has a time-dependent coupling parameter to an external field that can be modulated according to the temporal profile of a single photon. We obtain an explicit analytical form for the modulation function that enables perfect absorption of single photon fields with arbitrary temporal profiles by solving the QSDE describing the system being driven by a traveling single photon field. However, a practical limit on the coupling strength prohibits a faithful physical realization of the absorber, and a numerical example is included to illustrate the absorber's performance under constrained coupling strengths."
559237,21246,8494,Topological bifurcations in networks of proximity Kuramoto oscillators,2015,"In this paper, we present a numerical study on a modified Kuramoto model, in which the oscillators are coupled only if in mutual proximity. In particular, we show that the onset of phase locking is associated to the phenomenon of topological bifurcation. When the coupling strength belongs to a finite interval of values, all the oscillators asymptotically share the same frequency, but the topology of the interconnection may converge towards different steady-state values. This emerging phenomenon is thoroughly analyzed for the case of 5 nodes, while preliminary results are illustrated for larger networks."
2981319,21246,30,Unified phase variables of relative degree two for human locomotion,2016,"A starting point to achieve stable locomotion is synchronizing the leg joint kinematics during the gait cycle. Some biped robots parameterize a nonlinear controller (e.g., input-output feedback linearization) whose main objective is to track specific kinematic trajectories as a function of a single mechanical variable (i.e., a phase variable) in order to allow the robot to walk. A phase variable capable of parameterizing the entire gait cycle, the hip phase angle, has been used to control wearable robots and was recently shown to provide a robust representation of the phase of human gait. However, this unified phase variable relies on hip velocity, which is difficult to measure in real-time and prevents the use of derivative corrections in phase-based controllers for wearable robots. One derivative of this phase variable yields accelerations (i.e., the equations of motion), so the system is said to be relative degree-one. This means that there are states of the system that cannot be controlled. The goal of this paper is to offer relative degree-two alternatives to the hip phase angle and examine their robustness for parameterizing human gait."
1151914,21246,8441,On structured realizability and stabilizability of linear systems,2013,"We study the notion of structured realizability for linear systems defined over graphs. A stabilizable and detectable realization is structured if the state-space matrices inherit the sparsity pattern of the adjacency matrix of the associated graph. In this paper, we demonstrate that not every structured transfer matrix has a structured realization and we reveal the practical meaning of this fact. We also uncover a close connection between the structured realizability of a plant and whether the plant can be stabilized by a structured controller. In particular, we show that a structured stabilizing controller can only exist when the plant admits a structured realization. Finally, we give a parameterization of all structured stabilizing controllers and show that they always have structured realizations."
1586256,21246,8441,Adaptively constrained Stochastic Model Predictive Control for closed-loop constraint satisfaction,2013,"Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) for discrete-time linear systems subject to additive disturbances with chance constraints on the states and hard constraints on the inputs is considered. Current chance constrained MPC methods-based on analytic reformulations or on sampling approaches-tend to be conservative partly because they fail to exploit the predefined violation level in closed-loop. For many practical applications, this conservatism can lead to a loss in performance. We propose an adaptive SMPC scheme that starts with a standard conservative chance constrained formulation and then on-line adapts the formulation of constraints based on the experienced violation frequency. Using martingale theory we establish guarantees of convergence to the desired level of constraint violation in closed-loop for a special class of linear systems. Comments are given on how to extend this to a broader class of (non-)linear systems. The developed methodology is demonstrated with an illustrative example."
2978548,21246,9475,Vehicle lateral motion estimation with its dynamic and kinematic models based interacting multiple model filter,2016,"In this paper, we presents a comparative study of dynamic and kinematic vehicle models based on interacting multiple model(IMM) filter. It is known that the characteristics of kinematic and dynamic lateral motion models vary according to driving conditions. From the IMM filter, we can obtain the stochastically best blended state of the vehicle. Not only the performance of IMM filter but also the reliability of both kinematic and dynamic lateral motion models were evaluated according to the steering wheel angle, yaw rate and side slip angle. The performance of each model based filter and IMM filter were validated via experimental results with a test vehicle driven on a high speed circuit under various road and driving condition. We observe that the IMM estimation which reflects each model characteristic is robust against various driving conditions. Furthermore reliability of each model could contribute to the slip angle estimation which is very challenging to estimate accurately due to sensor cost and complexity."
1381625,21246,8441,Aliasing effects in direct digital adaptive control of plants with High-Frequency Dynamics and Disturbances,2013,"In this paper we consider sampled-data adaptive control in the presence of aliasing, due to either the high-frequency free response of the plant, or the high-frequency content in the disturbances. In particular, we present a numerical investigation of retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC) applied to sampled-data command-following and disturbance-rejection problems, and investigate the performance of RCAC in the presence of aliasing. It is shown that RCAC is able to stabilize the plant despite the high-frequency dynamics, unless the controllability of unstable modes is not lost due to sampling. However, the intersample command-following performance may be nonzero due to aliasing of disturbances."
3005638,21246,9475,Constrained source seeking for mobile robots via simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation,2016,"This paper considers a class of stochastic source seeking problems to drive a mobile robot to the maximizer of a source signal by only using measurements of the signal at the robot location. Our algorithm builds on the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation idea to obtain information of the signal field. We prove the practical convergence of the algorithm to a ball of size depending on the step-size that contains the location of the source. The novelty of our approach is that we consider nondifferentiable convex functions, a fixed step-size, and the environment can be restricted to any compact convex set. Our proof methods employ nonsmooth Lyapunov theory, tools from convex analysis and stochastic difference inclusions. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in a 2D scenario for the source seeking problem."
499326,21246,9475,"DistFlow ODE: Modeling, analyzing and controlling long distribution feeder",2012,"We consider a linear feeder connecting multiple distributed loads and generators to the sub-station. Voltage is controlled directly at the sub-station, however, voltage down the line shifts up or down, in particular depending on if the feeder operates in the power export regime or power import regime. Starting from this finite element description of the feeder, assuming that the consumption/generation is distributed heterogeneously along the feeder, and following the asymptotic homogenization approach, we derive simple low-parametric ODE model of the feeder. We also explain how the homogeneous ODE modeling is generalized to account for other distributed effects, e.g. for inverter based and voltage dependent control of reactive power. The resulting system of the DistFlow-ODEs, relating homogenized voltage to flows of real and reactive power along the lines, admits computationally efficient analysis in terms of the minimal number of the feeder line “media” parameters, such as the ratio of the inductance-to-resistance densities. Exploring the space of the media and control parameters allows us to test and juxtapose different measures of the system performance, in particular expressed in terms of the voltage drop along the feeder, power import/export from the feeder line as the whole, power losses within the feeder, and critical (with respect to possible voltage collapse) length of the feeder. Our most surprising funding relates to performance of a feeder rich on PhotoVoltaic (PV) systems during a sunny day. We observe that if the feeder is sufficiently long the DistFlow-ODEs may have multiple stable solutions. The multiplicity may mean troubles for successful recovery of the feeder after a very short, few periods long, fault at the head of the line."
1666587,21246,8228,Avoiding overages by deferred aggregate demand for PEV charging on the smart grid,2012,"We model the aggregate overnight demand for electricity by a large community of (possibly hybrid) plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) each of whose power demand follows a prescribed profile and is interruptible. The community is served by a regional electrical utility which is assumed to purchase electricity from a state/national distribution grid according to a flat-rate Φ per kilowatt-unit-time up to a threshold L, and thereafter overage (demand > L) charges π > Φ are leveed per kilowatt-unit-time. Rather than a spot-price system for household consumers (which would necessarily need to be operated by automated means overnight when most consumers sleep), the “grid” (regional utility) is “smart” in that it monitors its total load and, when overages threaten, can reduce load by signaling certain consumers to interrupt charging and defer their charging load by one unit of time. In this paper, we model the uninterrupted load by a Gaussian process which we justify by means of a functional central limit theorem (FCLT). This limiting Gaussian process is the arrival process of a discrete-time queue which is used to model the (partially) interrupted and deferred load over a finite time-horizon. We can then compute the mean amount of overage at the end of this time horizon (say at 6 AM when charging is to be completed ahead of the morning commute)."
1595490,21246,8441,A greedy rational Krylov method for ℋ 2 -pseudooptimal model order reduction with preservation of stability,2013,"We present a new approach to the problem of finding suitable expansion points in Krylov subspace methods for the model reduction of LTI systems. Using a factorized formulation of the resulting error model, we can efficiently apply a greedy algorithm and perform multiple reduction steps instead of looking for all shifts at once. An expedient globally convergent optimization algorithm delivers locally ℋ 2 -optimal two-dimensional ROMs in each step. The overall ROM, whose error decreases monotonically, is ℋ 2 -pseudooptimal and guaranteed to be stable; its order can be chosen on-the-fly. Ready-to-run Matlab demo code is provided in the Appendix."
2978704,21246,9475,Partial pinning control of complex networks,2016,"In large directed complex networks, it may result unfeasible to successfully pinning control the whole network. Indeed, when the number of pinned nodes has to be lower than the number of strictly connected components in the graph, it is impossible to guarantee pinning controllability of all the nodes in the network. In this paper, we introduce the partial pinning control problem, which consists in determining the optimal selection of the pinned nodes so as to maximize the fraction of nodes that can be asymptotically controlled to the pinner's trajectory. A suboptimal solution to this problem is provided for a class of nonlinear nodes' dynamics, together with the bounds on the minimum coupling and control gains required to actually control the network. The theoretical analysis is translated into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which is solved on a testbed network of 688 nodes building an ad hoc algorithm in Matlab."
2622439,21246,8960,Accelerated mirror descent in continuous and discrete time,2015,"We study accelerated mirror descent dynamics in continuous and discrete time. Combining the original continuous-time motivation of mirror descent with a recent ODE interpretation of Nesterov's accelerated method, we propose a family of continuous-time descent dynamics for convex functions with Lipschitz gradients, such that the solution trajectories converge to the optimum at a O(1/t2) rate. We then show that a large family of first-order accelerated methods can be obtained as a discretization of the ODE, and these methods converge at a O(1/k2) rate. This connection between accelerated mirror descent and the ODE provides an intuitive approach to the design and analysis of accelerated first-order algorithms."
2862432,21246,8228,Privacy aware distributed computing of control strategy for smart grids — A separable function approach,2016,"In the coming era of smart grids, the merging of advanced information infrastructure and power system intrigues the concern of information exchanging and privacy. Here we investigate the optimal distributed control issue with information exchanging in a deregulated power system, in which all utility companies are competitors and collaborators at the same time. The objective is to design a distributed approximate controller that stabilizes the system load frequency through network without manifesting the original system parameters and states. To this end, we derive the existence of an upper bound for the approximation of separable functions, which extends the application of Leontief's Theorem. This proof is then applied to design a distributed control strategy in the context of load frequency control with the awareness of information privacy. Simulation demonstrates that the approximate control law obtained for a two-area system stabilizes the system with negligible sacrifice on the performance of control."
1126886,21246,8441,Effect of coupling on the epidemic threshold in interconnected complex networks: A spectral analysis,2013,"In epidemic spreading models, if the infection strength is higher than a certain critical value - which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the epidemic spreads through the population. For a single arbitrary graph representing the contact network of the population under consideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of the spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario, it is not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some interconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact network. In this paper, we study the spreading process of a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in an interconnected network of two generic graphs with generic interconnection and different epidemic-related parameters. Using bifurcation theory and spectral graph theory, we find the epidemic threshold of one network as a function of the infection strength of the other coupled network and adjacency matrices of each graph and their interconnection, and provide a quantitative measure to distinguish weak and strong interconnection topology. These results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and control."

Recently, multi-agent systems have received increasing attention from mathematics, physics, engineering sciences, and social science communities. This paper firstly introduces several fundamental concepts and then reviews several representative models of multi-agent systems, including the Boids model, Vicsek model, Couzin-Levin model and its invariants, and various complex dynamical networks. Based on these models, it further investigates the dynamical behaviors of multi-agent systems, such as consensus, convergence, adaptation, and consensus decision-making. Moreover, it briefly reviews the main progress in the control of multi-agent systems. Finally, it looks ahead into some important research topics on multi-agent systems, with regard to modelling, analysis, and control."
823881,21246,8441,Robust “blind” navigation for a miniature ducted-fan aerial robot,2013,"This work presents a control strategy to allow a miniature ducted-fan aerial robot to perform flight operations in an unknown environment potentially cluttered with obstacles. As a main challenge, it is assumed that the vehicle is completely “blind”, namely that obstacles cannot be sensed a priori so as to be avoided or even detected in real-time by means of contact or force sensors installed on the vehicle. As a consequence, the control design has to be robust with respect to the presence of possible unexpected contacts with the surrounding environment. In order to maintain stability in such a complex scenario, the proposed approach relies both on some mechanical properties of the aircraft layout, such as in particular the relative position of possible contact points with respect to the onboard actuators, and on the presence of a supervisor able to detect the presence of an obstacle only by observing the behavior of the flight control loop. The effectiveness of the obtained results is then demonstrated by means of experiments on a real setup."
1140159,21246,8441,Optimization of human generated trajectories for safety controller synthesis,2013,"The aim of the optimal safety controller synthesis problem is to synthesize a feedback controller that results in closed-loop trajectories that meet certain criteria, namely, the state or output trajectories terminate in a goal set without entering an unsafe set while optimizing some function. Our previous work presented a method for using finitely many human generated trajectories to synthesize a non-optimal safety controller. We propose a formal method for optimizing the human generated trajectories used to synthesize the controller. Our method is based on the calculus of variations, but is different from other similar algorithms in that it uses a gradient descent based approach to directly solve the optimization problem without formulating the optimality conditions given by the Pontryagin Minimum Principle. This method provides a tool for improving the performance of a controller synthesized using the methods outlined in our previous work. We present an example of optimizing a human generated trajectory for a nonlinear system, specifically a quadrotor, and quantify the improvements it is able to generate."

The focus is on a multi-agent network that evolves under the linear agreement protocol. The results help determine if various components of the network are distinguishable from each other, based on the choice of initial conditions and the observed output responses. Identifiability of links and nodes are studied separately, and in each case, the role of symmetries in the network information flow graph are analyzed. Examples are provided to elucidate the results."

This algorithm can be viewed as a special case of the averaging consensus algorithm in the two-dimensional space. We also analyze the localization error under inaccurate anchor positions and angles measurements and provide approximate formulae for the error terms. The effectiveness of our localization algorithm and error assessment tools is demonstrated through numerical examples. The main contribution of our paper lies in the theoretical framework for analyzing AOA-based localization processes as well as assessing localization error."

The proposed framework unifies system thermodynamic concepts with feedback dissipativity and control theory to provide a thermodynamic-based semistabilization framework for feedback control design. Specifically, we consider feedback passive and dissipative systems since these systems are not only widespread in systems and control, but also have clear connections to thermodynamics. In addition, we define the notion of entropy for a nonlinear feedback dissipative dynamical system. Then, we develop a state feedback control design framework that minimizes the time-averaged system entropy and show that, under certain conditions, this controller also minimizes the time-averaged system energy. The main result is cast as an optimal control problem characterized by an optimization problem involving two linear matrix inequalities."
1316209,21246,8441,Second-order switching time and magnitude optimization for impulsive hybrid systems,2013,This paper presents a method to perform second-order impulsive hybrid system optimization that optimizes a cost functional over mode transition times and impulse magnitudes simultaneously. The derivation of the first-order and second-order derivatives of the cost functional with respect to switching times and impulse magnitudes is presented. An adjoint formulation is utilized to compute the derivatives for a faster convergence at a lower computational cost. An example in robotics illustrates the effectiveness of this optimization technique when measurement noise is present.
1240552,21246,8441,Robust Gain-Scheduled flight controller using inexact scheduling parameters,2013,"This paper is concerned with the design problem of Gain-Scheduled (GS) flight controller for the lateral-directional motions of an aircraft. For this problem, we first derive a continuous-time Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system which represents the lateral-directional motions of the aircraft in its admissible flight envelope with airspeed being set as its scheduling parameter, then discretize it by using Euler first-order approximation, and finally design a discrete-time GS Output-Feedback (GSOF) controller which is robust against the uncertainties in the provided airspeed data. In the design process of the GSOF controller, robustness against uncertainties related to onboard actuator systems are also incorporated. Flight test was conducted to confirm control performance of our controller in real environment."

Applying to the data of the 2009 outbreak of a new strain of influenza A (H1N1) in the United States, we obtain the invasion tree along which the virus spreads from the source state reporting the first confirmed case to infect other states. Basically, the surveillance-data-based inference of invasion tree agrees with real epidemic pathways observed in outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1), which verifies the validity of our heuristic inference algorithm."
729851,21246,23735,The Quadroller: Modeling of a UAV/UGV hybrid quadrotor,2014,"Energetic efficiency is a key limiting factor of hovering UAVs. Equipping a quadrotor with low-friction wheels allows it to exploit efficient rolling locomotion to travel long distances on smooth surfaces - common in human environments. A novel feature of this approach is the use of skateboard steering trucks that use lateral tilt to affect steering. This allows existing quadrotor flight controls for driving without modification to the avionics. In this paper we present turning mechanics for driving along the ground and performance curves for the vehicle rolling over different surfaces. We show experimentally that the rolling range of a commercial off-the-shelf quadrotor greatly exceeds its flying range, despite the small added mass of rolling wheels."

The system is planed to implement to a waist power assist suit that physically helps a caregiver in personal care tasks. The motion discrimination is based on surface electromyogram (SEMG) of right and left erector spinae muscles that dominate the motions of interest, and accomplished by using four SVMs in which each SVM is a binary classifier for each of four motions. We construct a strong multi-class classifier based on combination use of four SVMs. With a peripheral FFT-based prefilter, the start point of motion is estimated, and employed for a trigger to calculate a feature vector. We show that the proposed processing has a promising discrimination and false-positive rates for implementation. In addition, we summarize some essential problems to improve the performance of the system as future works."

Our approach only requires two consecutive images with a minimum of three feature matches. It does not require any (point) map nor any type of feature history. Thus it is an inherently failsafe approach that is immune to map and feature-track failures. With these minimal requirements we show in real experiments that the system is able to navigate drift free in all angles including yaw, in one metric position axis, and in 3D metric velocity. Furthermore, it is a power-on-and-go system able to online self-calibrate the inertial biases, the visual scale and the full 6DoF extrinsic transformation parameters between camera and IMU."
1326000,21246,9475,A predictive model for the anticoagulant bivalirudin administered to cardiac surgical patients,2013,"Bivalirudin is used in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and is a direct thrombin inhibitor. Since it is a rarely used drug, clinical experience with its dosing is sparse. We develop a model that predicts the effect of bivalirudin, measured by the Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), based on its past fusion rates. We learn population-wide model parameters by solving a nonlinear optimization problem that uses a training set of patient data. More interestingly, we devise an adaptive algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter that can adapt model parameters to individual patients. The latter adaptive model emerges as the most promising as it reduces both the mean error and, drastically, the per-patient error variance. The model accuracy we demonstrate on actual patient measurements is sufficient to be useful in guiding optimal therapy."
1456948,21246,9475,Detection of loading effects in bacterial stress response using biochemical stochasticity,2014,"Bacteria have the ability to sense environmental stress signals and translate them into the appropriate response necessary for survival. One recurring mechanism used for this are two-component systems composed of membrane-bound sensory proteins and response regulator proteins. The regulator proteins are transcription factors that activate a set of genes necessary to trigger the global response leading to phenotypic switching. Measuring the activity of these regulators is essential to the understanding of the stress response and is typically done through the insertion of non-native fluorescent reporter proteins. Introduction of these reporters inside the cell can cause loading as they interfere with the native cell response and regulator activity. In this paper we use mathematical modeling and analysis of a typical response mechanism to show how loading can bias the measurements and cause misidentification of important characteristics of the stress-induced response, such as its qualitative nature and the thresholds that cause phenotypic switching.We establish an approach for determining the presence of loading effects using single cell measurements and biochemical stochasticity of the reporter mechanism. The fluorescence measurements of the loaded system are shown to have different noise characteristics compared to unloaded systems, with larger loads creating more significant differences. The approach depends only on knowing the structural properties of the response model and the load, and it does not rely on the identification of model parameter values."
2546461,21246,23735,A pre-collision control strategy for human-robot interaction based on dissipated energy in potential inelastic impacts,2015,"Enabling human-robot collaboration raises new challenges in safety-oriented robot design and control. Indices that quantitatively describe human injury due to a human-robot collision are needed to propose suitable pre-collision control strategies. This paper presents a novel model-based injury index built on the concept of dissipated kinetic energy in a potential inelastic impact. This quantity represents the fracture energy lost when a human-robot collision occurs, modeling both clamped and unclamped cases. It depends on the robot reflected mass and velocity in the impact direction. The proposed index is expressed in analytical form suitable to be integrated in a constraint-based pre-collision control strategy. The exploited control architecture allows to perform a given robot task while simultaneously bounding our injury assessment and minimizing the reflected mass in the direction of the impact. Experiments have been performed on a lightweight robot ABB FRIDA to validate the proposed injury index as well as the pre-collision control strategy."
2595284,21246,20332,SmartShift: expanded load shifting incentive mechanism for risk-averse consumers,2015,"Peak demand for electricity continues to surge around the world. The supply-demand imbalance manifests itself in many forms, from rolling brownouts in California to power cuts in India. It is often suggested that exposing consumers to real-time pricing, will incentivize them to change their usage and mitigate the problem - akin to increasing tolls at peak commute times. We show that risk-averse consumers of electricity react to price fluctuations by scaling back on their total demand, not just their peak demand, leading to the unintended consequence of an overall decrease in production/consumption and reduced economic efficiency. We propose a new scheme that allows homes to move their demands from peak hours in exchange for greater electricity consumption in non-peak hours - akin to how airlines incentivize a passenger to move from an over-booked flight in exchange for, say, two tickets in the future. We present a formal framework for the incentive model that is applicable to different forms of the electricity market. We show that our scheme not only enables increased consumption and consumer social welfare but also allows the distribution company to increase profits. This is achieved by allowing load to be shifted while insulating consumers from real-time price fluctuations. This win-win is important if these methods are to be embraced in practice."
1276781,21246,8441,Hybrid switching control of automotive cold start hydrocarbon emission,2013,Reduction of cold start hydrocarbon (HC) emission requires a proper compromise between low engine-out HC emission and fast light-off of the three way catalytic converter (TWC). In this paper a model based approach is used to design and optimize a hybrid switching system for reducing HC emission of a mid-sized passenger car during the cold start phase of FTP-75. This hybrid system takes the benefit of increasing TWC temperature during the early stages of the driving cycle by switching between different operational modes. The switching times are optimized to reduce the cumulative tailpipe HC emission of an experimentally validated automotive emission model. It is shown that the new hybrid system can reduce cold start HC emissions by 7.5% to 52.5% compared to traditional single mode control approaches.
1128466,21246,208,Cooperative n-boundary tracking in large scale environments,2012,"Monitoring in large scale environments is a typical mission in cooperative robotics. This task requires the exploration of a huge domain by a generally small number of sensor equipped mobile robots. As time restrictions prohibit an exhaustive global search, a sampling strategy is required that allows an efficient spatial mapping of the environment. This paper proposes an adaptive sampling strategy for efficient simultaneous tracking of multiple concentration levels of an atmospheric plume by a team of cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The approach combines uncertainty and correlation-based concentration estimates to generate sampling points based on already gathered data. The adaptive generation of sampling locations is coupled to a distributed modelpredictive controller for planning optimal vehicle trajectories under collision and communication constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that connectivity of all involved vehicles can be maintained and an accurate reconstruction of the plume is obtained efficiently."
1879755,21246,8441,Models and methodology for optimal vehicle maneuvers applied to a hairpin turn,2013,"There is currently a strongly growing interest in obtaining optimal control solutions for vehicle maneuvers, both in order to understand optimal vehicle behavior and to devise improved safety systems, either by direct deployment of the solutions or by including mimicked driving techniques of professional drivers. However, it is nontrivial to find the right mix of models, formulations, and optimization tools to get useful results for the above purposes. Here, a platform is developed based on a state-of-the-art optimization tool together with adoption of existing vehicle models, where especially the tire models are in focus. A minimum-time formulation is chosen to the purpose of gaining insight in at-the-limit maneuvers, with the overall aim of possibly finding improved principles for future active safety systems. We present optimal maneuvers for different tire models with a common vehicle motion model, and the results are analyzed and discussed. Our main result is that a few-state single-track model combined with different tire models is able to replicate the behavior of experienced drivers. Further, we show that the different tire models give quantitatively different behavior in the optimal control of the vehicle in the maneuver."
1673055,21246,9078,Belief consensus for distributed action recognition,2011,"In this work, we consider a camera network where processing is distributed across the cameras. Our goal is to recognize actions of multiple targets consistently observed over the entire network. To obtain consistent and better results we need to properly fuse the action scores from multiple cameras. There have been multiple works on distributed tracking and distributed data association for multiple targets in a camera network. We can use the data association results and tracking confidence scores to improve the action recognition results. We propose a consensus based framework for solving this problem in an integrated manner and with a completely distributed camera network architecture. We propose a novel method for weighting the action scores based on tracking confidences and show how the cameras can reach a consensus about the action of a target using belief consensus. We show real life experiments and performance metrics with multiple cameras and targets."
1459046,21246,8441,Model Predictive Control for the navigation of a nonholonomic vehicle with field-of-view constraints,2013,"This paper considers the problem of navigating a differentially driven nonholonomic vehicle while maintaining visibility with a (stationary) target by means of Model Predictive Control (MPC). The approach combines the convergence properties of a dipolar vector field within a constrained nonlinear MPC formulation, in which visibility and input saturation constraints are encoded via recentered barrier functions. A dipolar vector field offers by construction a global feedback motion plan to a goal configuration, yet it does not ensure that visibility is always maintained. For this reason, it is suitably combined with recentered barrier functions so that convergence to the goal and satisfaction of visibility and input constraints are both achieved. The control strategy falls into the class of dual-mode MPC schemes and its efficacy is demonstrated through simulation results in the case of a mobile robot with unicycle kinematics."
1597293,21246,8441,A heuristic for sub-optimal ℌ 2 decentralized control subject to delay in non-quadratically-invariant systems,2013,"Inspired by potential applications to the smart grid, we develop a heuristic for sub-optimal, but acceptable, control of decentralized systems subject to non-quadratically invariant (non-QI) delay patterns. We do so by exploiting a recently developed solution to the decentralized H 2  model matching problem subject to delays, which decomposes the controller into a centralized, but delayed, component and a decentralized FIR component. In particular, we present an iterative procedure that exploits this decomposition to design a sub-optimal decentralized H 2  controller for non-QI systems that is guaranteed a priori to be stable, and to perform no worse than a controller computed with respect to a QI subset of the non-QI constraint set. We then apply this procedure to a smart-grid frequency regulation problem."
2928988,21246,9475,Aggregative control of large populations of noncooperative agents,2016,"We consider the problem to control a large population of noncooperative heterogeneous agents, each with strongly convex cost function depending on the average population state and convex constraints, towards an aggregative Nash equilibrium. We assume a minimal information structure through which a central controller can broadcast incentive signals to control the decentralized optimal responses of the agents. We propose a dynamic controller that, based on fixed point operator theory arguments, ensures global convergence if a sufficient condition on the matrix parameter defining the cost functions holds, yet independently on the convex constraints."
1727415,21246,8441,On stabilizability of LTI systems across a Gaussian MAC channel,2013,"In this paper, the problem of stabilizing two scalar plants across a Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) is addressed. Both states are encoded separately and sent across a shared MAC channel to a joint decoder/controller. A necessary condition for stabilizing such a system in the mean square sense is obtained using information-theoretic tools. This condition establishes the relationship between the magnitude of the unstable eigenvalues and the capacity region of Gaussian feedback multiple-access channel. A time-division encoding scheme along with a switched linear control law is proposed to achieve a rate region that is sufficient for stabilizability. The problem is studied both under the assumption that the two encoders can cooperate by sharing information and that they cannot."
2978610,21246,9475,ADMM prescaling for model predictive control,2016,"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is an iterative first order optimization algorithm for solving convex problems such as the ones arising in linear model predictive control (MPC). The ADMM convergence rate depends on a penalty (or step size) parameter that is often difficult to choose. In this paper we present an ADMM prescaling strategy for strongly convex quadratic problems with linear equality and box constraints. We apply this prescaling procedure to MPC-type problems with diagonal objective, which results in an elimination of the penalty parameter. Moreover, we illustrate our results in a numerical study that demonstrates the benefits of prescaling."
2948386,21246,9475,Aggregative control of competitive agents with coupled quadratic costs and shared constraints,2016,"We consider the problem to control a large population of noncooperative heterogeneous agents, each with strongly convex quadratic cost function depending on the average population state, and all sharing a convex constraint, towards a competitive equilibrium. We assume a minimal information structure through which a central controller can broadcast incentive signals to control the decentralized optimal responses of the agents. We propose a model-free dynamic control law that, based on monotone operator theory arguments, ensures global convergence to an equilibrium independently on the parameters defining the quadratic cost functions, nor on the convex constraints."
468853,21246,8494,Cooperative Design of Networked Observers for Stabilizing LTI Plants,2015,"With the rapid development of sensor networks in the last decade, the cooperative design for networked observers has received an increasing attention from engineering community. This paper aims at developing a unified framework for cooperative design of networked observers to stabilize LTI plants. Apart from the traditional centralized design of MIMO system, the proposed cooperative design approach only utilizes the local information of each sensor. For undirected networks, this paper obtains a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the parameters that lead to the stabilization of the LTI plant. In particular, we give the detailed design procedures for the parameters of networked observers, including feedback gains and the coupling strength. The numerical simulation is also given to validate the proposed theoretical results."
939885,21246,8228,Optimization of ARQ Protocols in Interference Networks with QoS Constraints,2011,"We study optimal transmission strategies in interfering wireless networks, under Quality of Service constraints. A buffered, dynamic network with multiple sources is considered, and sources use a retransmission strategy in order to improve packet delivery probability. The optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process, where constraints and objective functions are ratios of time-averaged cost functions. The optimal strategy is found as the solution of a Linear Fractional Program, where the optimization variables are the steady-state probability of state-action pairs. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of optimal transmission/interference strategies on the constraints imposed on the network."
1130438,21246,8441,A structured systems approach for optimal actuator-sensor placement in linear time-invariant systems,2013,"In this paper we address the actuator/sensor allocation problem for linear time invariant (LTI) systems. Given the structure of an autonomous linear dynamical system, the goal is to design the structure of the input matrix (commonly denoted by B) such that the system is structurally controllable with the restriction that each input be dedicated, i.e., it can only control directly a single state variable. We provide a methodology to determine the minimum number of dedicated inputs required to ensure structural controllability, and characterize all (when not unique) possible configurations of the minimal input matrix B. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solution incurs polynomial complexity in the number of state variables. By duality, the solution methodology may be readily extended to the structural design of the corresponding minimal output matrix (commonly denoted by C) that ensures structural observability."
1183004,21246,8441,Model Predictive Controller design for throttle and wastegate control of a turbocharged engine,2013,"In this paper, we consider the problem of turbocharged gasoline engine air-path control. Specifically, we apply linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) to coordinate throttle and turbocharger wastegate actuation for engine airflow and boost pressure control. Simplification of the prediction model used for the MPC reduces the memory requirement for implementation. We neglect the effects of variable cam timing in the prediction model, and instead, these effects are considered through a robustness analysis of the MPC to system variability. We compare two methods to achieve offset-free reference tracking, namely, the use of an integrator with actuator-saturation-based anti-windup logic, and the use of a Kalman filter to estimate plant-model mismatches. Evaluation of these methods for a vehicle acceleration scenario demonstrates advantages with using the Kalman-filter-based approach in the presence of system variability."

Existing methods for similar problems typically reduce the decentralized problem to a centralized problem of higher state dimension. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that the decentralized model matching solution can be constructed from the original centralized solution via quadratic programming."
3005486,21246,9475,Complexity reduction for uncertain systems: A projection-based approach,2016,"This paper considers the problem of complexity reduction for systems with affine parametric uncertainty. We are interested in the relation between model reduction for a nominal plant and dimension reduction for a parameter vector. By using linear fractional representations of the system, it is shown that a projection-based reduction approach can be applied separately to the generalized plant and the uncertainty block. The error bounds between the original system and its reduced order approximation are derived, and a case study is used to validate our findings."
2978754,21246,9475,Exponentially convergent decentralized charging control for large populations of plug-in electric vehicles,2016,"We address the problem to control the charging schedules in a large population of plug-in electric vehicles, considered as heterogeneous noncooperative agents, with different strongly convex quadratic cost functions weakly coupled by a common pricing signal, and convex charging constraints, e.g. plug-in times, deadlines and capacity limits. We assume a minimal information structure through which a central controller can broadcast incentive signals to coordinate the decentralized optimal responses of the agents. We propose a dynamic controller that, based on fixed point operator theory arguments, ensures global exponential convergence to an aggregative Nash equilibrium for large population size. We build upon the recent literature, further address general convex quadratic cost functions and convex constraints, and show exponential convergence without imposing technical assumptions. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of the proposed control law via numerical simulations, where the aggregate charging demand tends to fill the overnight demand valley."
3005637,21246,9475,Partial attitude consensus for underactuated satellite clusters,2016,"In this paper, we consider two problems dealing with the partial attitude synchronization of a multi-satellite system in which the satellites, modeled as rigid bodies, are underactuated. Having control authority about only two of the three principal axes, the objective is to align the uncontrolled third axis of all satellites such that they point along the same direction. Two control laws are proposed, one which aligns two satellites towards the same direction in inertial space, and another one which synchronizes an N-satellite system such that the satellites align their underactuated axes towards a fixed inertial direction. The synchronization discrepancy between the satellites is expressed in a unique parameterization that describes the uncontrolled axis of one satellite in the frame of the other via a stereographic projection, while the velocity discrepancy is described using a partial angular velocity difference."
2024869,21246,8960,Causal time series analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data,2009,"This review focuses on dynamic causal analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data to infer brain connectivity from a time series analysis and dynamical systems perspective. Causal influence is expressed in the Wiener-Akaike-Granger-Schweder (WAGS) tradition and dynamical systems are treated in a state space modeling framework. The nature of the fMRI signal is reviewed with emphasis on the involved neuronal, physiological and physical processes and their modeling as dynamical systems. In this context, two streams of development in modeling causal brain connectivity using fMRI are discussed: time series approaches to causality in a discrete time tradition and dynamic systems and control theory approaches in a continuous time tradition. This review closes with discussion of ongoing work and future perspectives on the integration of the two approaches."
1486241,21246,8441,Nonlinear observer for GNSS-aided inertial navigation with quaternion-based attitude estimation,2013,"For applications with limited computational capacity, observers designed based on nonlinear stability theory offer an alternative to computationally demanding extended Kalman filters. In this paper, we present a semiglobally stable nonlinear observer for estimating position, velocity, attitude, and gyro bias by combining a GNSS receiver with an inertial measurement unit including a magnetometer. Previous work by the authors on this topic was based on local navigation equations that ignored the Earth's rotation and curvature. Moreover, the attitude was represented by an over-parameterized 9-degrees-of-freedom matrix. The current paper improves on these aspects by using navigation equations that take the Earth's rotation and curvature into account, and by representing the attitude estimate as a unit quaternion. Furthermore, the observer is tested experimentally on data from a light fixed-wing aircraft."
933011,21246,8441,Distributed coverage optimization in a network of static and mobile sensors,2013,"This paper proposes efficient schemes to increase sensing coverage in a network composed of both mobile and static sensors. The proposed deployment techniques properly assign a virtual weight to every point in the sensing field, based on the information received from the other sensors regarding their sensing radii, and the location of the static ones. The multiplicatively weighted Voronoi (MW-Voronoi) diagram is used to discover the coverage holes corresponding to different mobile sensors with different sensing ranges. According to the proposed strategies, the mobile sensors move out of the area covered by static sensors, to a point from where it can cover the coverage holes of the static sensors. As a result, under the proposed strategies coverage holes in the network are reduced. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies developed in this paper."
1537455,21246,8441,Distributed deployment strategies to increase coverage in a network of wireless mobile sensors,2013,"Efficient sensor deployment algorithms are developed in this paper for efficient coverage in a network of wireless mobile sensors. The proposed strategies iteratively compute the position of the sensors based on existing coverage holes. These holes are obtained using a Voronoi diagram for the case of identical sensors, and a multiplicatively weighted Voronoi (MW-Voronoi) diagram in the case of sensors with different sensing ranges. Each sensor is driven by virtual forces applied to it from the vertices and boundaries of its Voronoi cell. These forces are obtained in such a way that the covered area of the corresponding cell increases. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategies, and their superiority to existing algorithms."

Such models often arise the describing dynamics in Life Science and Engineering systems. A method was presented by Beretta and Kuang in 2002. Their work extends their results to the general case with the exception of some degenerate cases. The interval of interest for the delay is partitioned to smaller intervals so that the magnitude condition generate a fixed number of frequencies as functions of the delay within each interval. The crossing conditions are expressed in a general form, and a simplified derivation for the first order derivative criterion is obtained."
1098889,21246,8441,Distributed coordination of a network of nonidentical agents with limited communication capabilities in the presence of fixed obstacles,2013,"In this paper, a distributed deployment algorithm is proposed for a network of multi-agent systems with limited and nonidentical communication ranges. An operation cost is defined for each agent, and it is aimed to minimize the overall cost function for both cases of an environment with and without obstacles. For the case of an obstacle-free environment, the notion of multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi (MW-Voronoi) diagram is extended to define limited communication MW-Voronoi (LCMW-Voronoi) diagram. A motion coordination strategy is subsequently presented to move the agents in such a way that the cost function over the region associated with each agent is minimized. For the second case, the limited communication visibility-aware MW-Voronoi (LCVMW-Voronoi) diagram is introduced and a proper motion coordination strategy is proposed to achieve the desired objective. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique."

Optim. Theory Appl., Vol. 70, No 1, pp 1–23, 1991). We propose a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) approach in order to compute the value function associated to the problem, as well as trajectory reconstruction procedures based on the value function, or on a related exit time function. Some numerical illustrations are included to show the relevance of our approach."
1641975,21246,8441,Inversion-free stabilization and regulation of systems with hysteresis using integral action,2013,"In this paper, we present analysis on the stabilization and regulation of the tracking error for an n-dimensional dynamic system with zero dynamics, which is preceded by a Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis operator. A general controller structure is considered; however, we assume that an integral action is present. We treat this problem from the perspective of switched systems, where the state of the hysteresis operator defines the switching surfaces. The common Lyapunov function theorem is utilized together with an LMI condition to show that, under suitable conditions, the tracking error of the system goes to zero exponentially fast when a constant reference is considered. A key feature of this LMI condition is that it does not require the hysteresis effect to be small, meaning that hysteresis inversion is not required. We use this condition together with a periodicity assumption to prove that a servocompensator-based controller can stabilize a system with hysteresis without using hysteresis inversion. Finally, we conduct experiments using a servocompensator-based controller, where we verify the stability of the system and achieve a mean tracking error of 0.5% at 200 Hz using a sinusoidal reference."

For a single summation quadratic function, it provides a upper bound which depends on not only the concerned summation interval but also other summation interval. Thus, the proposed summation inequality has more flexibility, which leads to improved stability criteria for discrete-time systems with interval-time-varying delays."

We derive an efficient algorithm for the computation of the log-likelihood function and its gradient, which can be used in gradient-based optimization algorithms. This algorithm uses UD decomposition of symmetric matrices and the array algorithm for covariance update and gradient computation. We test our algorithm on the Lotka-Volterra equations.

The accelerations of the reference signals, which could be discontinuous, are assumed to be upper bounded. A sliding-mode surface is designed such that the trajectory on the surface will solve the average tracking problem. For this purpose, a discontinuous control algorithm is proposed to guarantee that the system trajectory reaches the surface in finite time. It is shown that if the communication graph is connected, then by properly choosing the control gain the average tracking problem is solved."

Disturbances on both the translational and angular velocities are considered. It is assumed that disturbance dynamics are known a priori while their initial conditions are unknown. The norm and the angle of a typical control vector for the consensus of disturbance-free single-integrator agents is used to design the proposed controllers. The control input for each agent consists of two parts. One part which leads to consensus in disturbance-free case, and a second term which compensates for the disturbances. The simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed controllers."

The approach consists in translating state and input constraints into a constraint on the value of the Lyapunov function which is then enforced by suitably manipulating the derivative of the applied reference. This paper extends the Explicit Reference Governor approach by addressing its robustness in the presence of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Using ISS arguments, it will be shown that the robustness with respect to external disturbances can be ensured by simply restricting the domain of the applied reference. Parametric uncertainties can instead be accounted for using suitable bounds on the Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

1539647,21246,9475,An iterative clustering procedure,1970,"In many remote sensing applications millions of measurements can be made from a satellite at one time, and many times the data is of marginal value. In these situations clustering techniques might save much data transmission without loss of information since cluster codes may be transmitted instead of multidimensional data points. Data points within a cluster are highly similar so that interpretation of the cluster code can be meaningfully made on the basis of knowing what sort of data point is typical of those in the cluster. We introduce an iterative clustering technique; the procedure suboptimally minimizes the probability of differences between the binary reconstructions from the cluster codes and the original binary data. The iterative clustering technique was programmed for the GE 635 KANDIDATS (Kansas Digital Image Data System) and tested on two data sets. The first was a multi-image set. Twelve images of the northern part of Yellowstone Park were taken by the Michigan scanner system, and the images were reduced and run with the program. Thirty-thousand data points, each consisting of a binary vector of 25 components, were clustered into four clusters. The percentage difference between the components of the reconstructed binary data and the original binary data was 20 percent. The second data set consisted of measurements of the frequency content of the signals from lightning discharges. One hundred and thirty-four data measurements, each consisting of a binary vector of 32 components, were clustered into four clusters."
790490,21246,9475,Optimal allocation strategies of perennial plants,2013,"In this paper we propose a novel optimal allocation model for perennial plants. We consider not only favorable for photosynthesis periods, but analyze the whole life of a perennial plant. This provides more information about strategies of a plant during transitions between favorable and unfavorable seasons. One of predictions of our model is that a plant can begin re-establishment of vegetative tissues some time before the beginning of the favorable conditions, so as to come into the better environmental conditions with a certain amount of already developed vegetative tissues. In the second part of the paper we extend the model by assuming that a plant controls not only a distribution of carbohydrates, but also a size of a seed. We provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal strategy for a plant is to produce as much seeds as possible. These results can be applied, in particular, for colonizing species and plants living in open environments."
1066495,21246,8441,Information modeling for direct control of distributed energy resources,2013,"We present an architecture for an unbundled liberalized electricity market system where a virtual power plant (VPP) is able to control a number of distributed energy resources (DERs) directly through a two-way communication link. The aggregator who operates the VPP utilizes the accumulated flexibility of the DERs to participate in the electricity market on equal terms with conventional power plants. The focus of this paper is the interface between the DERs and the VPP: this interface must enable the aggregator to overview the total DER flexibility and remote control the DERs to provide a desired accumulated response. In this paper, we design such an information model based on the markets that the aggregator participates in and based on the flexibility characteristics of the remote controlled DERs. The information model is constructed in a modular manner making the interface suitable for a whole range of different DERs. The devised information model can serve as input to the international standardization efforts on DERs."
2996206,21246,9475,Synthesis of an energy-optimal self-heating strategy for Li-ion batteries,2016,"The resistance of Lithium-ion cells increases at sub-zero temperatures reducing the cells' power availability. One way to improve the cells' performance in these adverse operation conditions is to proactively heat them. In this paper, we consider the scenario in which a cell is heated from both inside and outside; a current is drawn from the cell to power a convective heater; Joule heating warms the cell from inside. A problem formulation to derive the time-limited energy-optimal current policy is presented, analyzed and numerically solved. It is observed that the optimal current policy resembles a sequence of constant voltage, constant current and phases, mirroring conventional wisdom. Finally, the notion of productive warm-up—a warm-up procedure that ensures that the cell can perform work once warmed-up—is introduced; and an approximation of the optimal solution is used to identify the lowest state of charge at various operating conditions (portion of the state-space) from which productive warm-up is feasible."
3005573,21246,9475,Stochastic hybrid systems approach to modeling dynamics of cell size,2016,"A ubiquitous feature of all living cells is their growth over time followed by division into two daughter cells. How a population of genetically identical cells maintains size homeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing fundamental problem. We model size using a stochastic hybrid system, where a cell grows exponentially over time and probabilistic division events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever these events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We first consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures the time since the last division event regulates cellular growth and the rate of cell division. Analysis reveals that such a timer-driven system cannot achieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation grows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for controlling size we consider two different classes of models: i) a constant growth rate and size-dependent division rate and ii) a constant growth rate and division rate that depends both on the cell size and timer. We show that each of these strategies can potentially achieve bounded intercellular size variation, and derive closed-form expressions for this variation in terms of underlying model parameters. Finally, we discuss how different organisms have adopted the above strategies for maintaining cell size homeostasis."
2946198,21246,9475,Filter comparison for estimation on discretized PDEs modeling traffic: Ensemble Kalman Filter and minimax filter,2016,"Traffic State Estimation (TSE) refers to the estimation of the state (i.e., density, speed, or other parameters) of vehicular traffic on roads based on partial observation data (e.g., road-side detectors and on-vehicle GPS devices). It can be used as a component in applications such as traffic control systems as a means to identify and alleviate congestion. In existing studies, the Kalman Filter and its extensions, notably the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), are commonly employed for TSE. Recently, the MF has been newly adapted to this domain as a filtering algorithm for TSE. In this article, we compare the performance of the EnKF and the MF on discretized PDE models of traffic flow traffic. Specifically, for the EnKF study, the estimation is performed using stationary and mobile sensor information based on actual traffic data, by employing EnKF in conjunction with a Godunov discretization of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. For the minimax study, the discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the LWR model is used in conjunction with the implicitly-linearized MF to obtain state estimates using the same data. The advantages and disadvantages of each of the filters are empirically quantified. Insights for practical application and future research directions are presented."
2930904,21246,9475,On finite harmonic games,2016,"Two fundamental problems about finite pure harmonic games are investigated in this paper. First, the pure Nash equilibrium of finite pure harmonic games (PHGs) is investigated. For the basis games, the number and precise forms of Nash equilibria are presented. For two-player pure harmonic games, the structure of games with pure Nash equilibrium is revealed. Second, the dynamical equivalence to basis games has been discussed for evolutionary pure harmonic games. A necessary and sufficient condition is obtained."
1479446,21246,8441,On connectivity preservation in mobile wireless multi-agent/node mesh networks,2013,"The paper considers the development of a mission planning system for a so-called `non-cooperative' multi-agent network. The network comprises two classes of agent: primary mission agents and relay agents. The primary mission agents have predefined tasks to execute and operate autonomously within the field of operation. Although these agents operate independently, from a mission planning perspective the base station is required to maintain contact. In order to ensure this, relay agents are employed under the direct command of the base station with the objective of maintaining connectivity. This paper proposes an architecture to control the relay agents in such a way that connectivity, as measured in terms of the Fiedler eigenvalue, is maximized subject to the cost of moving the relay agents. A model predictive control-like layer is used to generate a set of way-points to position the relay agents at specific places at specific instances of time to maximize connectivity. These way-points are then converted into continuous time paths for the relay agents to follow. A low level sliding mode controller implemented on each relay agent ensures that the proposed path is followed in a robust fashion."
2930758,21246,9475,Coupled actuator placement and controller design for electromagnetic heating by means of dynamic optimization,2016,"An approach is presented for the optimal actuator placement in the course of electromagnetic heating. As this problem strongly depends on the control inputs for the actuators, the approach is incorporated into a suitable optimization framework for the control design of multiphysics systems. A joint optimization problem is formulated for both the actuator placement and the controller design problem. The adjoint-based sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the formal Lagrangian technique is applied to derive the optimality conditions. Simulation results for a surface hardening process demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the approach."
856202,21246,8441,Retransmitting lost measurements to improve remote estimation,2013,"In this work, we consider the problem of remotely estimating a discrete-time system over a communication system with packet losses. To improve the estimates, we propose to acknowledge received measurement packets and retransmit lost measurements within the next measurement packet. Although previous works found no benefit in acknowledging and retransmitting measurement packets, we show that by a proper design of the retransmission scheme, it is possible to get optimal estimates without huge data transfers or preprocessing the measurements within the sensor."
1196484,21246,8441,Constrained optimization for opportunistic distributed visual sensing,2013,"Distributed networks of dynamically controllable pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras have high potential utility for tracking and high-res imaging of targets-of-interest maneuvering within a surveillance area. The actual utility that is achieved is determined by the real-time selection of the networked camera PTZ parameters to collaboratively achieve these objectives. This paper proposes a control mechanism for such a network to obtain opportunistic high-res facial imagery via distributed constrained optimization of PTZ parameters for each camera in the network. The objective function quantifies the per camera per target image quality. The tracking constraint that defines the feasible PTZ parameter space is a lower bound on the information about the estimated position for each target. All cameras optimize their PTZ parameters simultaneously using information broadcast by neighboring cameras. At certain time steps, due to the configuration of the targets relative to the cameras, and the fact that each camera may track many targets, the camera network may be able to achieve the tracking specification with remaining degrees-of-freedom that can be used to obtain high-res facial images from desirable aspect angles. The challenge is to define algorithms to automatically find these time instants, the appropriate imaging camera, and the appropriate parameter settings for all cameras to capitalize on these opportunities. The solution proposed herein involves a Bayesian formulation (for an automatic trade off of objective maximization versus the risk of losing track of any target), design of aligned local and global objective functions and the inequality constraint set, and development of a Distributed Lagrangian Consensus algorithm that allows cameras to exchange information and asymptotically converge on a pair of primal-dual optimal solutions. This article presents the theoretical solution along with simulation results."
2254495,21246,8441,Time-optimal vehicle posture control to mitigate unavoidable collisions using conventional control inputs,2013,"This paper analyzes the mitigation of an unavoidable T-bone collision, where an “intelligent” vehicle executes an aggressive time-optimal rotation to achieve a favorable relative orientation with another vehicle prior to impact. The current paper extends the previous work by the authors on this problem, by modeling additional vehicle dynamics (neglected in the prior work) and by utilizing conventionally available control commands (that is, steering, braking, handbrake) for the maneuvering vehicle. The commands can either be applied directly by a trained driver, or (as in the majority of cases) can be executed with the help of a combination of an Active Front Steering (AFS) and an Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system onboard the vehicle. The optimal yaw rotation maneuver is analyzed for different initial speeds on both dry and wet asphalt. The results confirm the existence of an “option zone” for some cases, within which such an aggressive maneuver may be possible and perhaps even preferable to straight line braking."
1361152,21246,8441,Time-varying norm optimal iterative learning identification,2013,"In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of an Iterative Learning Identification (ILI) algorithm for identifying discrete, Single-Input Single-Output (SISO), Linear Time- Varying (LTV) plants that are able to repeat their trajectories. The identification learning laws are determined through an optimization framework, which is similar in nature to the design of norm optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC). The ILI algorithm has been previously demonstrated to be capable of tracking rapid parameter changes. However, when it is applied to systems with noise, it results in high frequency parameter fluctuation around their true values. This paper suggests a time-varying ILI technique to improve the steady state estimation while maintaining the ILI's ability to track rapid parameter changes."
2930844,21246,9475,CPG control for assisting human with periodic motion tasks,2016,"Oscillatory movements play important roles in human life, such as the arm and leg movements during human locomotion. In this paper, we introduce a method for designing a feedback controller for a robotic system to help a human with periodic motion tasks. The control objective is to stabilize a human-intended oscillatory movement while reducing the required human effort. For the control architecture, we adopt the central pattern generator (CPG), which is a neuronal circuit for rhythmic motor pattern. Animal locomotions under CPG control are capable of complying with various environment dynamics to yield different oscillatory movements. We take advantage of a mathematical model of reciprocal inhibition oscillator (RIO), a simple-structured and well-studied type of CPG. The RIO controller acts as a nonlinear damping compensator and removes part of the resistive forces in the system, thereby reducing the human effort. It is shown that the resulting human-intended oscillation is a locally stable periodic solution of the closed-loop system. The result is first presented for a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanical system and then extended to a multi-DOF system."
1666657,21246,8441,Readiness in formation control of multi-robot system,2013,"To analyze the performance of the formation system in response to inputs/disturbances from outside of the formation, we propose the notion of readiness, which describes the initial conditions of the formation in terms of a certain set of input space. A higher readiness means better initial conditions of the system with better performance in maintaining or recovering the original formation shape against the exogenous inputs/disturbances. Optimization method based on calculus of variations is used in the analysis for deriving the optimality conditions. Simulations modeled on both unicycle and car-like robots demonstrate the features and the potential applications of the proposed notion."
992467,21246,8441,Robustness of stochastic stability in game theoretic learning,2013,"The notion of stochastic stability is used in game theoretic learning to characterize which joint actions of players exhibit high probabilities of occurrence in the long run. This paper examines the impact of two types of errors on stochastic stability: i) small unstructured uncertainty in the game parameters and ii) slow time variations of the game parameters. In the first case, we derive a continuity result bounds the effects of small uncertainties. In the second case, we show that game play tracks drifting stochastically stable states under sufficiently slow time variations. The analysis is in terms of Markov chains and hence is applicable to a variety of game theoretic learning rules. Nonetheless, the approach is illustrated on the widely studied rule of log-linear learning. Finally, the results are applied in both simulation and laboratory experiments to distributed area coverage with mobile robots."
2978513,21246,9475,Cycle time optimization for deterministic timed weighted marked graphs under infinite server semantics,2016,"Timed Petri nets are commonly used for modelling and analysis of automated manufacturing systems, including batch or high throughput systems. This paper consider the cycle optimization problem for a deterministic timed weighted marked graphs under infinite server semantics. The problem aims to find an initial marking to minimize the cycle time while the weighted sum of tokens in places is less than or equal to a desired value. We transform a timed weighted marked graph into several equivalent timed marked graphs and present a mixed integer linear programming method which can provide an optimal solution. Meanwhile, two suboptimal methods are proposed to reduce the computational cost."
814201,21246,8441,On the use of a relay for Kalman filtering over packet dropping links,2013,"This paper considers the use of a relay to improve the performance of Kalman filtering over i.i.d. packet dropping links. We consider a situation with two sensors and one relay, where the relay can either i) forward the measurement of the first sensor to the gateway/fusion center, ii) forward the measurement of the second sensor to the gateway, or iii) perform a simple network coding operation. Using an upper bound to the expected error covariance matrix as a performance measure, we characterize situations where either one of the three schemes for the relay will give the best performance. Numerical simulations of the expected error covariance matrix confirm this qualitative behaviour."
2930884,21246,9475,On the maximally-permissive range control problem in partially-observed discrete event systems,2016,"We investigate the supervisor synthesis problem for centralized partially-observed discrete event systems subject to safety specifications. It is well known that this problem does not have a unique supremal solution in general. Instead, there may be several incomparable locally maximal solutions. One then needs a mechanism to select one locally maximal solution. Our approach in this paper is to consider a lower bound specification on the controlled behavior, in addition to the upper bound for the safety specification. This leads to a generalized supervisory control problem called the range control problem. While the upper bound captures the (prefix-closed) legal behavior, the lower bound captures the (prefix-closed) minimum required behavior. We provide a synthesis algorithm that solves this problem by effectively constructing a maximally-permissive safe supervisor that contains the required lower bound behavior. This is the first algorithm with such properties, as previous works solve either the maximally-permissive safety problem (with no lower bound), or the lower bound containment problem (without maximal permissiveness)."
2946161,21246,9475,Robust distributed consensus on the median value for networks of heterogeneously perturbed agents,2016,"The problem of how to force the states of a network of non-identical systems to converge on a predefined function of the their initial conditions is a problematic challenge because of unknown perturbations or unmodeled dynamics shift the equilibrium of the network with respect to the expected “nominal” one. Furthermore, whenever outlier agents are considered, the well-studied averaged estimation of the agents initial conditions which find application in several field is definitely compromised due to the fragility of the mean statistical measure. In light of these considerations, in this paper we show how the integral sliding-mode control design paradigm can be usefully applied in the framework of multi-agent systems to solve the consensus on the median value problem for a network of perturbed non-identical single integrators. Lyapunov analysis is presented to support the convergence properties of the algorithm, and simulative results are discussed to corroborate the theoretical result."
736392,21246,8441,Distributed adaptive sliding mode observers for a network of dynamical systems,2013,"This paper addresses the problem of monitoring a network of dynamical systems, by reconstructing the states of each node robustly, and in a distributed manner. The dynamics of each node of the network is assumed to have a known linear part and an unknown, but bounded uncertainty/nonlinearity element restricted to certain channels. For this class of systems a distributed observer, based on sliding mode principles is proposed. An adaptation law is part of the observer scheme and is used to ensure global state estimation properties are obtained. The distributed observer is structured such that each node relies on locally available information together with information collected from `neighbouring' nodes in the network. The gains of the observer are synthesised in a decentralised manner based on node level models. The proposed methodology is verified by means of a simulation example of a network of Chua oscillators."
3005538,21246,9475,Decentralized optimal frequency control of interconnected power systems with transient constraints,2016,"We design decentralized frequency control of multi-area power systems that will re-balance power and drive frequencies to their nominal values after a disturbance. Both generators and controllable loads are utilized to achieve frequency stability while minimizing regulation cost. In contrast to recent results, the design is completely decentralized and does not require communication between areas. Our control enforces operational constraints not only in equilibrium but also during transient. Moreover, our control is capable of adapting to unknown load disturbance. We show that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and converges to an equilibrium that minimizes the regulation cost. We present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design."
2936392,21246,9475,Time-varying feedback for finite-time robust regulation of normal-form nonlinear systems,2016,"While non-smooth approaches (including sliding mode control) provide explicit feedback laws that ensure finite-time stabilization but in terminal time that depends on the initial condition, fixed-time optimal control with a terminal constraint ensures regulation in prescribed time but lacks the explicit character in the presence of nonlinearities and uncertainties. In this paper we present an alternative to these approaches, which, while lacking optimality, provides explicit time-varying feedback laws that achieve regulation in prescribed finite time, even in the presence of non-vanishing (though matched) uncertain nonlinearities. Our approach employs a scaling of the state by a function of time that grows unbounded towards the terminal time and is followed by a design of a controller that stabilizes the system in the scaled state representation, yielding regulation in prescribed finite time for the original state."
2946065,21246,9475,Stochastic sensor scheduling for multiple dynamical processes over a shared channel,2016,"We consider the problem of multiple sensor scheduling for remote state estimation over a shared link. A number of sensors monitor different dynamical processes simultaneously but only one sensor can access the shared channel at each time instant to transmit the data packet to the estimator. We propose a stochastic event-based sensor scheduling framework in which each sensor makes transmission decisions based on both the channel accessibility and the self event-triggering condition. The corresponding optimal estimator is explicitly given. By ultilizing the realtime information, the proposed schedule is shown to be a generalization of the time-based ones and outperform the time-based ones in terms of the estimation quality. By formulating an Markov decision process (MDP) problem with average cost criterion, we can find the optimal parameters for the event-based schedule. For practical use, we also design a simple suboptimal schedule to mitigate the computational complexity of solving an MDP problem. We also propose a method to quantify the optimality gap for any suboptimal schedules."
2936418,21246,9475,On the discrete-time modeling and control of synchronous generators by means of variational integrators and sliding modes,2016,"This work deals with the discrete-time modeling and control design for synchronous generators by means of a variational integrator and sliding modes. First, a continuous non-conservative Lagrangian is formulated for the plant, then, the respective discrete Lagrangian is determined. Based on this, discrete-time rules are derived for synchronous generators. Second, a sliding-mode controller is proposed for the velocity stabilization of the system, and a nonlinear observer is designed for the non-measurable states. Simulations show the good performance of the synchronous generator when closed-loop with the novel discrete-time controller."
1596226,21246,8441,A distributed Command Governor Approach for voltage regulation in Medium Voltage power grids with distributed generation,2013,"A distributed multi-agent supervision strategy (S-CG) based on Command Governor ideas is proposed to solve constrained voltage regulation problems in electrical Medium Voltage (MV) power grids in the presence of Distributed Generation (DG). The idea is that an active management of the set-points of some controllable variables of the grid, e.g. the power either provided by the distributed generators or consumed by the loads, can be an effective tool not only for maintaining relevant system variables within prescribed operative constraints in response to unexpected adverse conditions, but also for implementing some smart-grid functionalities. The supervision problem is formulated as a distributed constrained optimization problem by imposing that the voltages at certain nodes have, compatibly with all prescribed constraints and changed conditions, minimal deviations from their nominal values. Simulation results show that the proposed approach ensures, under certain conditions, feasible evolutions to the overall power grid under critical events."
1307280,21246,8441,A decentralized algorithm for balancing a strongly connected weighted digraph,2013,"In this work we propose a decentralized algorithm for balancing a strongly connected weighted digraph. This algorithm relies on the decentralized estimation of the left eigenvector associated to the zero structural eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. The estimation is performed through the distributed computation of the powers of the Laplacian matrix itself. This information can be locally used by each agent to modify the weights of its incoming edges so that their sum is equal to the sum of the weights outgoing this agent, i.e., the weighted digraph is balanced. Simulation results are proposed to corroborate the theoretical results."

Necessary and sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points are provided. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for almost global attractivity are given. To carry out this analysis a new Lyapunov-like function is proposed to establish convergence of bounded trajectories, while the latter is proven using the powerful theoretical framework of cell structures pioneered by Leonov and Noldus"
3005646,21246,9475,A tool for power flow analysis of a generalized class of droop controllers for high-voltage direct-current transmission systems,2016,"The problem of primary control of high-voltage direct current transmission systems is addressed in this paper, which contains three main contributions. First, to propose a new nonlinear, more realistic, model for the system suitable for primary control design, which takes into account nonlinearities introduced by conventional inner controllers. Second, to determine necessary conditions—dependent on some free controller tuning parameters—for the existence of equilibria. Third, to formulate additional (necessary) conditions for these equilibria to satisfy the power sharing constraints. The usefulness of the theoretical results is illustrated via numerical calculations on a four-terminal example."

The objective is to minimize the sum of agent-specific composite convex functions over agent-specific private conic constraint sets; hence, the optimal consensus decision should lie in the intersection of these private sets. We provide convergence rates in sub-optimality, infeasibility and consensus violation; examine the effect of underlying network topology on the convergence rates of the proposed decentralized algorithms; and show how to extend these methods to handle time-varying communication networks."
2964820,21246,9475,Repetitive Scenario Design,2016,"Repetitive Scenario Design (RSD) is a randomized approach to robust design based on iterating two phases: a standard scenario design phase that uses N scenarios (design samples), followed by randomized feasibility phase that uses N o  test samples on the scenario solution. We give a full and exact probabilistic characterization of the number of iterations required by the RSD approach for returning a solution, as a function of N, N o , and of the desired levels of probabilistic robustness in the solution. This novel approach broadens the applicability of the scenario technology, since the user is now presented with a clear tradeoff between the number N of design samples and the ensuing expected number of repetitions required by the RSD algorithm. The plain (one-shot) scenario design becomes just one of the possibilities, sitting at one extreme of the tradeoff curve, in which one insists in finding a solution in a single repetition: this comes at the cost of possibly high N. Other possibilities along the tradeoff curve use lower N values, but possibly require more than one repetition."

It features pipeline architecture with an MILP-specific configuration and two-port SRAM. Based on the architecture, both FPGA and VLSI implementations have been done to solve sample problems including 16 variables. The FPGA implementation can reduce the power consumption to 13 W: an 85.4% reduction compared to a 3.0-GHz processor (Pentium 4; Intel Corp.).

1410541,21246,9475,Packet error probabilities in frequency hopped spread spectrum packet radio networks-Memoryless frequency hopping patterns considered,1987,"In this paper we compute the packet error probability induced in a frequency hopped spread spectrum packet radio network. The frequency spectrum is divided into q frequency bins and the packets are divided into M bytes each. Every user in the network sends each of the M bytes of his packet at a frequency chosen among the q frequencies with equal probability, and independently of the frequencies chosen for other bytes (i.e. memoryless frequency-hopping patterns). Furthermore, statistically independent frequency hopping patterns correspond to different users in the network. We show that, although memoryless frequency hopping patterns are utilized, the byte errors at the receiver are not statistically independent instead they exhibit a Markovian structure. We also compute the packet error probability induced when Reed-Solomon codes are used for the encoding of the packets."
2946052,21246,9475,Load aggregation effect in power grid,2016,"In this paper, the issue of data-driven modeling of a single load in a laboratory set-up is confronted with the same data-driven modeling of the same load, but in a real grid environment. As it is argued here, an aggregation effect of all of the loads in a grid endows a single load with grid-characteristics properties in addition to the usual load-specific properties. Topologically, the hidden feedback structure of a bus model reveals that the resulting digraph is strongly connected, meaning that all loads are intertwined in a single system that cannot be decomposed into islands."
2112424,21246,8441,Further results on the observability in magneto-inertial navigation,2013,"This paper shows that one can relax an important assumption usually formulated to employ the magneto-inertial navigation (MINAV) technique. This technique, which allows to reconstruct the velocity of a rigid body moving in a magnetically disturbed area, usually assumes that the (unknown) Jacobian of the magnetic field is everywhere non-singular. As it is here demonstrated, this assumption can be significantly alleviated thanks to further investigations on the observability of the dynamics at stake. Corresponding relaxed assumptions require rotations to sufficiently come into play during the motion one wishes to estimate the velocity of. This result opens new perspectives on the range of applicability of the MINAV technique."
2946028,21246,9475,Constrained stochastic hybrid system modeling to road map - GPS integration for vehicle positioning,2016,"This paper considers the vehicle positioning problem of an automobile on-board navigation system which is mainly supported by Global Positioning System (GPS). To complement GPS, the existing navigation techniques incorporate additional vehicle sensors, together with the map data to match the positioning solution with the road map. We propose an advanced map-matching algorithm that integrates the additional map data with GPS and vehicle sensor measurements. Specifically, the detailed road map data, where individual road segments are subdivided into lanes, can impose further restriction on the vehicle as it is likely to move along the center of each lane and is rarely at boundary. Such a tendency can be mathematically interpreted as a statistical constraint in our map-matching algorithm. In addition, the lane change behavior of the vehicle can be accounted for by the discrete modes assigned to the individual road lanes. Then, the overall positioning process can be posed as a constrained stochastic hybrid system framework. The proposed map-matching algorithm provides more reliable vehicle positioning (continuous state estimate) and lane discrimination (discrete mode estimate) without needing costly sensor resources."
2948362,21246,9475,Geometry of correlation networks for studying the biology of cancer,2016,"In this note, we extend the notion of Ollivier-Ricci curvature on weighted graphs with all positive weights to the case in which the weights may also be negative. This is done by employing the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of signed measures, allowing us to extend the Earth Mover's Distance to an extended class of measures. The resulting curvature will be utilized to study the robustness properties of general networks. In particular, this will be applied to certain cancer transcription networks in order to elucidate fragility (in the sense of a rate function from large deviations theory) with respect to those genes responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis related to growth and proliferation."

We show that, as the dimension of the state space goes to infinity, the probability of (A,b) being controllable approaches one for many choices of the vector b including elements of the standard basis, the all-one vector, and random binary vectors. In particular, we verify a conjecture of Godsil [1] and show that most systems are controllable from single inputs."
2964834,21246,9475,Finding the weakest link(s): Coalition games for decentralized discrete-event control,2016,"In decentralized discrete-event system (DES) architectures, agents fuse their local decisions to arrive at the global decision. The contribution of each agent to the final decision is never assessed; however, it may be the case that only a subset of agents, i.e., a (static) coalition, perpetually contribute towards the correct final decisions. In casting the decentralized DES control (with and without communication) problem as a cooperative game, it is possible to quantify the average contribution that each agent makes towards synthesizing the overall correct control strategy. Specifically, we explore allocations that assess contributions of non-communicating and communicating controllers for this class of problems. This allows a quantification of the contribution that each agent makes to the coalition with respect to decisions made solely based on its partial observations and decisions made based on messages sent to another agent(s) to facilitate a correct control decision."

In this paper we introduce a method of implementing such a cold storage room into a directly controlled smart grid, by use of a predictive control strategy. In this application the shift in consumption is used to stabilize a small grid by utilizing excess renewable energy to minimize the need for fossil fueled production sources. In order for the centralized grid controller to handle such a node, its flexibility is communicated in form of a simple generic bucket model. Finally, the provided experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
3005470,21246,9475,Online algorithms for network formation,2016,"We introduce an online network formation game: starting with a base graph and a set of candidate edges, at each round, player one picks an edge and reveals it to player two, then player two decides whether to accept it; player two can accept a limited number of edges and makes online decisions aiming to achieve optimal properties (e.g., the number of spanning trees, algebraic connectivity, and total effective resistance) in the synthesized network. Online network formation arises in cooperative multiagent systems, such as robots establishing a secure network in a changing uncertain environment, or individuals forming teams in social networks. We propose a primal-dual algorithm framework for this problem. At each round the algorithm updates the dual solution using all information from previous rounds, and decides the weight on the new edge based on the complementary slackness conditions. We give interpretations of the algorithm for different graph objectives, and derive a bound on the competitive ratio of the algorithm for the log-determinant problem."

We begin by deriving kinematic constraints for the “effective shape” of the human leg during locomotion. This shape characterizes ankle and knee motion as a function of the Center of Pressure (COP)-the point on the foot sole where the ground reaction force is imparted. Since the COP moves monotonically from heel to toe during steady walking, we adopt the COP as the phase variable of an autonomous feedback controller. We show that our kinematic constraints can be enforced virtually by an output linearizing controller that uses only feedback available to sensors onboard a prosthetic leg. This controller produces walking gaits with human-like knee flexion in simulations of a 6-link biped with feet. Hence, both knee and ankle control can be coordinated by one simple control objective: maintaining a constant-curvature effective shape."
2996248,21246,9475,Sampling-based min-max uncertainty path planning,2016,"We propose a new sampling-based path planning algorithm, the Min-Max Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (MM-RRT*), for robot path planning under localization uncertainty. The projected growth of error in a robot's state estimate is curbed by minimizing the maximum state estimate uncertainty encountered on a path. The algorithm builds and maintains a tree that is shared in state space and belief space, with a single belief per robot state. Due to the fact that many states will share the same maximum uncertainty, resulting from a shared parent node, the algorithm uses secondary objective functions to break ties among neighboring nodes with identical maximum uncertainty. The algorithm offers a compelling alternative to sampling-based algorithms with additive cost representations of uncertainty, which will penalize high-precision navigation routes that are longer in duration."
2976685,21246,9475,Robustification of backstepping against input unmodeled dynamics,1999,"We present two redesigns to robustify backstepping control laws against dynamic uncertainties at the input of the plant. In the first redesign we construct a passivating control law from a control Lyapunov function obtained by backstepping. In the second redesign we simplify the passivation redesign which becomes cumbersome for high order systems. We also review the two main versions of backstepping: cancellation and L/sub G/V-backstepping, and compare their stability margins."
2238257,21246,8494,Stability analysis of SSN biochemical networks,2011,"This paper further investigates the dynamical properties of a class of basic biochemical networks modules — single substrate and single product with no inhibition (SSN) module. It is well known that the biological networks can be modelled by using different kinetics according to their reaction types. This paper introduces the SSN model under the law of mass action and proves that it can admit uniquely globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium. Moreover, we prove that the SSN module under Hill kinetics can admit uniquely asymptotically stable positive equilibrium. It indicates some potential applications in the understanding of some biological networks modules and the design of some specific network controllers."
2996266,21246,9475,Secure local filtering algorithms for distributed optimization,2016,"We study a class of local filtering algorithms for consensus-based distributed optimization in the presence of faulty or adversarial nodes. These algorithms do not require the regular nodes to know anything about the global network (other than their own neighbors), and are thus highly scalable. For this class of algorithms, we provide graph-theoretic conditions that guarantee consensus among the regular nodes under various bounds on the number of adversarial nodes (either across the entire network, or in the local neighborhood of any regular node). We prove that a consequence of reaching consensus is that the states of the regular nodes converge to the convex hull of the minimizers of their individual functions, regardless of the actions taken by the adversarial nodes."
2978443,21246,9475,Guaranteed maximum power point tracking by scalar iterations with quadratic convergence rate,2016,"In this paper the problem of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is considered. We show that the problem has a unique solution and it can be reduced to the problem of finding the unique root of a single variable scalar function. We show that Newton's iterations can be applied to the problem of finding this root quadratically fast for an initialisation that is independent of the parameters of the MPPT problem. The results of applying the approach to 1,000,000 randomly-generated instances of the MPPT problem are presented and consistency with the analysis is observed."
1427433,21246,8441,"Simultaneous stabilization and optimization of unknown, time-varying systems",2013,"Extremum Seeking (ES) has a long history as a tool for locating the extremum points of unknown functions. Recently, by using the ES method to seek the minimum of Lyapunov functions, the ES approach has been demonstrated as a tool for stabilization of unknown systems, removing the distinction between optimization and stabilization. This work combines the dual aspects of the ES method for simultaneous stabilization and optimization. The resulting control scheme optimizes the output of unknown maps, of unknown and possibly unstable, time-varying dynamic systems. Intuitively the approach can be thought of as achieving trajectory tracking of an unknown trajectory, which is the time-varying optimal point of a time-varying map, despite the influence of unstable system dynamics. The motivation for this is the control of an autonomous vehicle, which is chasing a source whose trajectory is unknown, but which is somehow detectable with the detection strength dropping off as a function of distance, physical examples of which may be electric charge, temperature, or chemical concentration. The destabilizing terms may be thought of as unknown environmental variables, such as wind or fluid flow, which may push the autonomous vehicle away from its desired path. Obviously, the multi-dimensional results presented here can be applied to more abstract systems, with many dimensions, such as the states (voltages, currents...) of multiple components of complicated circuits operating in unknown conditions. The results presented guarantee that the system's state will converge to and remain ultimately bounded within some local max/min of the unknown, time-varying output function. In the case of the output having a global max/min ultimate boundedness to within a neighborhood of the global extremum is guaranteed."
942601,21246,8441,Ancillary service for the grid via control of commercial building HVAC systems,2013,"The thermal storage potential in buildings is an enormous untapped resource for providing various services to the power grid. The large thermal capacities of commercial buildings in particular make the power demands of their Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems inherently flexible. In this paper, we show how fans in air handing units (AHUs) of commercial buildings alone can provide substantial regulation service, with little change in their indoor environments. A feedforward architecture is proposed to control the fan power consumption to track a regulation signal. The proposed control scheme is then tested through simulations based on a high fidelity commercial building model constructed based on Pugh Hall located on the University of Florida campus. For the HVAC system under consideration, numerical experiments demonstrate how up to 15% of fan power capacity can be deployed for regulation purposes while having little effect on the building inside temperature. The regulation signal can be successfully tracked in the frequency band [1/τ 0 , 1/τ 1 ], where τ 0  ≈ 3 minutes and τ 1  ≈ 8 seconds. Our results indicate that fans in existing commercial buildings in the U.S. can provide about 70% of the current national regulation reserve in the aforementioned frequency band."
1550559,21246,8441,Distributed linear programming and bargaining in exchange networks,2013,"Many engineering, economic, and social scenarios are modeled as neighboring agents in a network interacting with each other. In the setup we consider, neighboring agents (i) bargain over the possibility of matching with at most one other agent and (ii) agree on how to allocate a common good between them. In particular, we examine stable and fair outcomes called Nash bargaining solutions. Our main contribution is the design of continuous-time distributed dynamics that converge to these Nash solutions. The technical approach leads us to develop distributed dynamics for linear programming, the results of which are of independent interest. We invoke Lyapunov techniques to prove convergence and draw results from nonsmooth and set-valued analysis of dynamical systems. In the literature pertinent to bargaining problems of the form we consider, this control perspective is unique."
2964794,21246,9475,Ensuring safety for sampled data systems: An efficient algorithm for filtering potentially unsafe input signals,2016,"A common design pattern in cyber-physical systems features a continuous plant and a discrete controller in a feedback loop. Sampled data analysis attempts to take into consideration both the continuous and discrete time elements of such a design. In this paper we adapt an earlier algorithm for efficient ellipsoidal approximation of robust sampled data finite horizon viability kernels to compute capture basins for systems with linear dynamics. Using these capture basins, we construct a hybrid automaton which can verify and if necessary modify an exogenous input signal to ensure safety. The hybrid automaton can be run online in the controller so that it can handle exogenous input signals arriving in real time, such as might be generated by human-in-the-loop control. The technique is demonstrated on a six dimensional nonlinear longitudinal model of a quadrotor with a human pilot in the loop. The capture basins' robustness is used to handle the model nonlinearity in a sound fashion."
1369964,21246,9475,Intrinsic consensus on SO(3) with almost-global convergence,2012,"In this paper we propose a discrete time protocol to align the states of a network of agents evolving in the space of rotations SO(3). The starting point of our work is Riemannian consensus, a general and intrinsic extension of classical consensus algorithms to Riemannian manifolds. Unfortunately, this algorithm is guaranteed to align the states only when the initial states are not too far apart. We show how to modify Riemannian consensus so that the states of the agents can be aligned, in practice, from almost any initial condition. While we focus on the specific case of SO(3), we hope that this work will represent the first step toward more general results."
2930725,21246,9475,Distributed flowrate-pressure control of fluid flow networks,2016,"A differential-algebraic nonlinear dynamic model for FFNs with multiple fan branches is proposed based on the branch dynamics and network graph properties. Then, a novel adaptive decentralized flowrate-pressure controller, which takes a proportional-integral (PI) form, is established. This controller not only guarantees the satisfactory closed-loop stability but also has no need in the values of network physical parameters. This newly-built adaptive control is then applied to solve the flowrate-pressure regulation problem for the secondary loop of an under-constructed two-modular high temperature gas-cooled nuclear plant, and the numerical simulation results show the feasibility and high performance of this network control strategy."

The topological properties of the parametrization, which are relevant for the consistency of the parameters, are analyzed. The algorithm contains both model selection steps and estimation of real valued parameters. One of the appealing features of the algorithm is that for given order at most 3 optimization steps have to be performed."

We compare the state regulation performance for a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and gain scheduled LQR (gsLQR), applied to nonlinear longitudinal open-loop dynamics of F-16, under stochastic initial condition uncertainty. It is shown that both controllers have comparable immediate and asymptotic performance, but gsLQR achieves better transient performance than LQR. Algorithms based on Perron-Frobenius operator, are given for tractable computation. Numerical results from the proposed method, are in unison with Monte Carlo simulations."
737445,21246,8441,Energy management via pricing in LQ dynamic games,2013,"This paper investigates the use of pricing mechanisms as a means to achieve a desired feedback control strategy among selfish agents in the context of HVAC resource allocation in buildings. We pose the problem of resource allocation as a linear-quadratic game with many dynamically coupled zone occupants(agents) and an uncoupled social planner. The social planner influences the game by choosing the quadratic dependence on control actions for each agent's cost function. We propose a neighborhood-based simplification of the dynamic game that results in a more realistic and scalable framework than is considered in standard dynamic game theory. In addition, we construct the pricing design problem as a convex feasibility problem and apply our method to an eight zone building model."
1916624,21246,8441,A two-phase approach to stability of networks given in iISS framework: Utilization of a matrix-like criterion,2013,"This article is concerned with global asymptotic stability (GAS) of dynamical networks. The case when subsystems are integral input-to-state stable (iISS) has been recognized as notoriously difficult to deal with in the literature. In fact, the lack of energy dissipation for large input denies direct application of the small-gain argument for input-to-state stable (ISS) subsystems. Here for networks consisting of iISS subsystems it is demonstrated that a two-phase approach allows us to make use of the ISS small-gain argument by separating a trajectory into a transient and a subsequent ISS-like phase. In contrast to the previous iISS results, the two-phase approach immediately leads to a sufficiency criterion for GAS of general nonlinear networks, which is given in a matrix-like form (order condition)."
2930642,21246,9475,A forward-backward Bregman splitting scheme for regularized distributed optimization problems,2016,"We consider regularized distributed optimization problems over networks. The problem arises from many existing domains, such as coordinated control, sensor fusion and distributed learning. We propose a new framework based on Bregman method and operator splitting, which allows us to come up with a general distributed algorithm, termed Distributed Forward-Backward Bregman Splitting (D-FBBS). The proposed algorithm, though derived from a different perspective, is shown to have close connections with some existing algorithms. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithm is able to seek a saddle point which solves the above primal problem as well as its dual simultaneously. We also establish a non-ergodic convergence rate of o(1/k) in terms of fixed point residual. A simple example of sensor fusion problem is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm."
2930699,21246,9475,Structural bistability analysis of Boolean networks,2016,"Bistability, i.e., the existence of two stable equilibria, is an important property in both natural systems and artificial systems. This paper addresses the bistability of network systems under the assumption that the information on the network structure is available but the information on the components is not available. Such a stability notion is called here the structural bistability. First, we introduce Boolean networks as network systems to be studied here and give the notion of the structural bistability. We next focus on the systems with a chain-shaped network structure, where cycles are linearly interconnected, and derive a necessary and sufficient condition of the structural bistability."

The design uses fuzzy interpolation techniques and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approaches. Detailed construction of a fuzzy inference system used to produce price signals is provided. LMI conditions for dynamic pricing are derived using the Lyapunov theory. Numerical analysis of fuzzy gains in the pricing scheme is performed, exhibiting a less conservative design than a standard pricing scheme. Those analyses and derivations can facilitate further modifications when a different pricing scenario is encountered."
3005522,21246,9475,Synthesis of adaptive controllers for spacecraft rendezvous maneuvers using nonlinear models of relative motion,2016,"This work is concerned with the design of adaptive learning controllers for rendezvous maneuvers of two spacecraft. Unlike earlier efforts using linearized dynamics, the current work considers the nonlinear equations of relative motion. The main idea behind the Lyapunov-based controller design is to allow a flexibility in the time-varying gains to adapt in proportion to the relative distance of the two spacecraft. By augmenting an adaptive controller, one opts to improve controller performance. The adaptation schemes of the controller gains are derived via Lyapunov redesign methods. In order to gain some insights on the choice of the optimal gains, a scheme that penalizes a combination of the relative position error and of the relative velocity error is considered. Extensive numerical studies are provided to further support the theoretical predictions on the choice of controller gains."
2978641,21246,9475,Brayton-moser formulation of infinite dimensional port-hamiltonian systems with application to boundary control,2016,"In this paper, for a class of distributed port-Hamiltonian systems defined on a one-dimensional spatial domain, an equivalent Brayton-Moser formulation is provided. The dynamic is expressed as a gradient equation with respect to a new storage function, the “mixed-potential,” with the dimensions of power. The system is then passive with respect to a supply rate that is related to the reactive power, and that depends on the boundary port variables and on their time derivatives. This equivalent representation is the starting point for the development of boundary control laws able to shape the mixed-potential function. Differently from energy-balancing control schemes, this technique allows to deal with pervasive dissipation in the system in an effective way. The general theory is illustrated with the help of an example, the boundary stabilisation of a transmission line with internal dissipation."
1380286,21246,8441,Distributed flocking of second-order multi-agent systems with global connectivity maintenance,2013,"This paper investigates the problem of connectivity-preserving flocking of multiple autonomous agents with second-order dynamics. First, the inverse power iteration algorithm is formulated in a completely distributed manner to estimate the algebraic connectivity, i.e., the second smallest eigenvalue of the group Laplacian, as well as the corresponding eigenvector. Furthermore, distributed gradient-based flocking algorithms that exploit decentralized eigenvalue/eigenvector estimation are developed both to steer the agent group to the desired flocking motion and to maintain the global connectivity of the underlying network during maneuvers. Different from the common potential/tension function method which keeps certain fixed edges all the time, the algorithm proposed in this paper guarantees the global connectivity which allows any existing edge to be broken, thus gives more freedom of motions for the agents. Finally, nontrivial simulations are performed to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical results."

This allowed us to track curves, identify unknown control gains, and provide predictable tolerance and safety bounds. In this work, we provide a variant of our SIAM article. We provide a new method to maintain robust forward invariance of compact regions in the state space, under arbitrarily large perturbation bounds. Our new technique entails scaling certain control components. It provides a substantially different algorithm from our SIAM article and is suitable for real time applications."

It relates an analytic property of a square transfer matrix in the frequency domain to a set of algebraic equations involving parameters of a minimal realization in the time domain. This note proves that the KYP lemma is also valid for realizations which are stabilizable and observable.
2996252,21246,9475,On the control by interconnection and exponential stabilisation of infinite dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems,2016,"This paper aims at illustrating how the control by interconnection methodology (energy-Casimir method) can be employed in the development of exponentially stabilising boundary control laws for a class of linear, distributed port-Hamiltonian systems with one dimensional spatial domain. The energy-Casimir method is the starting point to determine a state-feedback law able to shape the closed-loop Hamiltonian and achieve simple stability. Then, it is shown how to design a further control loop that guarantees exponential convergence. Thanks to this result, it is possible to overcome a limitation of standard damping injection strategies that, if combined with energy shaping control laws based on energy-balancing, are able to assure, in general, only asymptotic convergence. The methodology is illustrated with the help of a simple example, the boundary stabilisation of a lossless transmission line."

A general case of constrained subsystems with external disturbances is considered and a suitable set-based near-consensus condition is set as the target condition to achieve. The proposed scheme employs computationally efficient, closed-loop MPC policies in the subsystems together with a distributed optimization method to optimize the global consensus trajectory and the subsystem control inputs in real time. It also allows the incorporation of computational delays in the policy formulation so that the desired control performance is ensured."

We first generalize the notions of equitable partitions and almost equitable partitions to make them applicable to directed, weighted graphs. Consequently, we are enabled to characterize the controllable subspace of a given diffusively coupled multi-agent system using graph theoretic ideas. After comparing the condition to realize cluster synchronization and the condition for the network to be controllable, we conclude that those diffusively coupled multi-agent networks that are not controllable usually realize cluster synchronization asymptotically. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the theoretical results."

1702368,21246,9475,Maximum hands-off control and L 1 optimality,2013,"In this article, we propose a new paradigm of control, called a maximum hands-off control. A hands-off control is defined as a control that has a much shorter support than the horizon length. The maximum hands-off control is the minimum support (or sparsest) control among all admissible controls. We first prove that a solution to an L 1 -optimal control problem gives a maximum hands-off control, and vice versa. This result rationalizes the use of L 1  optimality in computing a maximum hands-off control. The solution has in general the “bang-off-bang” property, and hence the control may be discontinuous. We then propose an L 1 /L 2 -optimal control to obtain a continuous hands-off control. Examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method."
