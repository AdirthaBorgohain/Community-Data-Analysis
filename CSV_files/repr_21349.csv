1874654,21349,11104,Sea slicks and oil spills-the chemical structure and morphology determines the remote sensing signals,2004,"The different morphology of palmitic acid metliyl ester (PME) slicks spread from n-hexane or ethanol was studied by 'Brewster Angle Microscopy' [BAM]. In the latter case, already at large areas per molecule a foam-like structure is being formed on the water surface, i.e., a two-dimensional network which appears to be comparable with the morphological structure of biogenic sea slicks. In line with this assumption, both the magnitudes of the radar backscatter damping ratios and the characteristics of the damping ratio/wavenumber curves were comparable for the PME slick spread from ethanol and for the biogenic slicks, while in the presence of the PME slick spread from n-hexane lower damping ratios were determined. Furthermore, the relaxation of alkanoic acid esters, which are often being found in biogenic sea slicks, was investigated by 'Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy' [IRR4S]. It turned out that the ester group is continuously hydrated and dehydrated during compression and dilation on an undulating water wave field. If can be safely assumed that the strong water wave damping induced by these chemical compounds is centrally related to this phenomenon."
2900992,21349,11104,Stability assessment of high-speed railway using advanced InSAR technique,2016,"High-speed railways play important roles in connecting populated cities. Strict attention to ground subsidence is applied to ensure its transportation safety. Shanghai-Hangzhou high-speed railway is an important part of China's “Four Vertical and Four Horizontal” Passenger Line Network. In this study, TerraSAR-X and ASAR images were employed to recover the surface evolution along the high-speed railway using advanced InSAR technique. A spatial-temporal criterion is updated for PS identification. Nonlinear deformation is modeled and removed by a linear least squares fit. Measurements from TSX and ASAR during a closer period as well as the transverse subsidence profiles showing a fairly consistent agreement. According to the longitudinal subsidence profiles, although the subsidence gradient now is within the guidelines of high-speed railway, the increasing cumulative subsidence can still be a potential threat for the line."

2933659,21349,11104,Canopy vertical parameters estimation using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery,2016,"Canopy vertical parameters, such as tree height, side shape and gap fraction are critical for forestry studies. However, it is not trivial to retrieve them from remotely sensed data. Currently, only LiDAR data can directly provide some of these parameters. Due to low availability and relatively high cost, it is still crucial to develop methodologies that can directly derive these parameters from other data. In this study, a longitudinal profile based approach is introduced based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, which has successfully estimated a series of canopy vertical parameters."

830897,21349,11104,"GLOBE students in Sunland Park, New Mexico study satellite images to decipher August 2006 flood damage",2007,"Students at Desert View Elementary School in Sunland Park, New Mexico have been involved in the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) Fermilab Engaged Learning Program, and New Mexico Service Learning Program for several years. Land Cover change, especially those changes affecting watersheds, is part of GLOBE's agenda. During an extreme precipitation event, August 1, 2006, the Sunland Park, New Mexico, Cuidad Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas region experienced severe flooding as a result of torrential rains, and subsequent failure of an inadequately engineered municipal drainage system. A record 187 mm (7.5 in.) reportedly fell in three hours. In an effort to demonstrate to his students why this storm event created such havoc in the region, Albert Ortiz, a teacher at Desert View, decided to have his students use satellite imagery to investigate the problem. The students were asked to study the images to determine what effect land development, particularly in areas where major arroyos drain the mountain slopes, added to the flooding. Since no post flood images could be obtained the students were taken on a field trip to selected areas with copies of these images to analyze changes that had taken place as a result of flash flooding. The students first measured width of several major arroyos and compared it with what they saw on the pre-flood image. They found them to be at least four times wider. They determined the cross-sectional area of selected arroyos and estimated the amount of discharge coming from them during peak flow. In the field they elected to follow, and take measurements in the main arroyo leading from Franklin Mountain State Park, to where it entered the Rio Grande River. This park is located on the western flank of the mountain. As the students followed the arroyo out of the park down to where it passed under a bridge at Trans-Mountain Road and 1-10, about 9 km away, they could see on the satellite image that several other arroyos converged with the one they were following. They again measured the arroyo at that location. After passing under the Interstate bridge, the drainage water from these arroyos is diverted into a channel that makes a 45 degree angle from a direct path to the river. The channel's size and angle was completely inadequate to handle the volume of water flowing into it as a result of the heavy rain. A small housing development located next to the channel at Mowad St. was engulfed by mud and flood water from the overflowing channel and the houses were declared completely uninhabitable and condemned. The students visited the Mowad St. development where they saw condemned houses and piles of rubble where other houses had been bulldozed. They discussed how much of the destruction could have been prevented. By using satellite images, and comparing them with what they investigated on their field trip, the students were able to see how much change had taken place in their watershed, both from natural causes and by residential and industrial development on the mountain slopes. They also learned how technology can be used to address real life problems such as the one that overtook the Mowad St. subdivision."
1023729,21349,11104,A grammatical framework for building rooftop extraction,2009,"Roof detection has been studied for several decades, one of the big challenge is its structure and appearance diversity. In this paper, we present a grammatical framework to account for these diversities and a multiple way compositional algorithm to extract rooftops from aerial images. We represent rooftops by a context sensitive graph grammar consisting of 5 production rules and 3 types of commonly shared quadrilateral primitives. Each production rule includes a number of equations that constrain the attributes of a parent node and those of its children. In addition, a set of horizontal links are defined between peer nodes at the same level that account for spatial/appearance constraints. The graph grammar produces a large number of valid configurations and can be used to represent the wide structural variability of rooftops. Our rooftop extraction algorithm starts with a lower level bottom-up step that generates hypothesis of quadrilateral primitives by grouping edgelets hierarchically into bigger structures (straight lines, parallel lines and junctions). The grouping process repeats multiple times following alternative paths to reduce missing detections caused by partial occlusion and/or background clutter. Then the higher level relations served as context for lower level elements evaluates each hypothesis according to the graph grammar model and prunes incompatible ones to arrive at an optimal solution."

As part of their GLOBE instruction teachers Joel Gilbert (Canutillo HS) and Sharon Mitchell (Slider MS) introduce their students to the basic concepts of remote sensing. Both Gilbert and Mitchell's courses include the study of satellite imagery. The students are first shown how the images are composed of tiny dots called pixels, and that a pixel represents the instantaneous field of view of the ground surface imaged. Students are also taught that the ground surface area represented by one pixel in a satellite image is called ground resolution'' and that the greater the number of pixels per inch, the greater the resolution. The students also learn that satellites transmit these pixel images to ground stations as digital signals, which represent the ground surface being imaged. It is through this lesson, ground surface reflectivity and light's behavior as it is sent back to a satellite's sensors, that Gilbert is able to build his course upon the TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills) standards with relevant instruction. In this lesson, a grayscale image, which may vary in tone, is presented to the class. Then false color is added to emphasize a particular feature, such as vegetation. The class is then introduced to the electromagnetic spectrum and is shown how different wavelengths of light produce the false color images that appear in satellite imagery. Gilbert's IPC (integrated physics and chemistry) classes study the properties of light as part of their course work, and since satellite sensors operate by picking up the way light is reflected from various surfaces, it is easy for him to incorporate the studying of these images into his lesson plans. For the last several years, Mitchell has been studying remote sensing with her eighth grade classes at Slider Middle School. Using a set of six Landsat images of El Paso that she received from PACES (Pan American Center for Environmental Studies) at UTEP, for the years 1984, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997 and 2001, she instructs the students (working in teams of two) to study the changes (urban sprawl) that had taken place over that seventeen-year period. First, she has the students tape transparent sheets over the images and then gives them a list of major streets and sites e.g. their school to identify and label. They are then asked to study the images to see which year each site first appeared on the image. Through studying and comparing the images the students are able to see how much change has taken place. Both Gilbert and Mitchell end their lessons discussing how urban sprawl puts a strain on area water supplies, and what, given the crisis drought situation in the west, what the future consequences can be"
2900513,21349,11104,An amplitude optimization method for suppressing sidelobes at specified intervals,2016,"Waveforms with low autocorrelation sidelobes are favorable to weak target detection and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. In this paper, we aim at solving the problem of designing waveforms with low autocorrelation sidelobes at specified intervals. Thus an amplitude optimization method (AOM) is proposed to minimize the weighted integrated sidelobe level (WISL) of the autocorrelation. By regarding the WISL metric as the objective function, the amplitude gradient is deduced. Then, the conjugate gradient method (CGM) is applied to search the optimal waveform amplitude. As the searching step size of CGM can be calculated directly, AOM is computationally efficient. In addition, the proposed method can be initialized randomly. Numerical experiments show that the waveforms designed by AOM have virtually zero autocorrelation sidelobes at the specified intervals."

2901068,21349,11104,"Simultaneous estimation of building height and ground deformation over Xi'an City, China using multi-temporal InSAR method",2016,"InSAR has been widely used in monitoring land subsidence over large area. However, many factors in InSAR processing, such as decorrelation error, atmosphere error, height error and thermal noise limit the accuracy of InSAR measurements. The height error over urban area is particularly the most difficult issue in TerraSAR-X data processing for its shorter wavelength and higher spatial resolution. We employed a Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) method based on the PS and SBAS method proposed by Hopper to estimate height of urban building and ground deformation simultaneously. By means of MTI method, the first raw urban DSM with 1,500 km 2  areas over urban area has been mapped with a height accuracy of about 5 m. The MTI-derived deformation shows that the established TerraSAR DSM reduced the height error influence on deformation phase effectively. GPS and leveling measurements are applied to calibrate the InSAR results. Precision of our InSAR annual subsidence can reach 6 mm."

We produced a 0.5°×1.0° lat-lon daily gridded near fundamental decadal data record (FDDR) of AIRS all sky brightness temperatures (BT) for all 2378 AIRS channels including the 4µ and 12µ surface windows for the 9-year period. We show (i) that decadal difference trends between the spectrally convolved AIRS and MODIS IR surface channels 3.96µ, 4.05µ and 12.03µ are as small as 0.01K, 0.016K and 0.001K per year respectively, suitable to detect year to year decadal trends of AIRS global surface BTs as small as 0.1K over the decade. (ii) The analysis of gridded AIRS surface BT channel 4.16µ and 12.18µ reveals no global annual warming trend between 2003–2011 and negligible trends for both hemispheres in the 9-year period. (iii) Both AIRS channels 4.16µ and 12.18µ show a statistically significant global annual BT warming trend of 0.6K and 0.87K respectively in the Arctic (60N–90N) with yearly changes varying by as much as 1.6K. (iv) Finally, we show that AIRS global surface BT spectral channel 4.16µ has a correlation with annual, seasonal and monthly GISS global station surface temperature data records 0.96, 0.9, 0.82 respectively. We conjecture that direct satellite level 1B AIRS IR radiance sounding observations constitute a FDDR and that well calibrated IR surface BTs can serve as a surrogate for directly observing global climate surface temperatures."

The present study uses the ITU-R P618-8 rain attenuation model to determine the signal loss in the transmission link for microwave frequencies of 20.2 and 30.5 GHz at New Delhi. For this purpose, 1-hourly Automatic Weather Station (AWS) rain rate has been converted to 1-minute integration time using ITU-R P837-6, before being used in the attenuation model. Analysis suggests that the rain attenuation is directly proportional to the rain rate and microwave frequencies. Moreover, it has also been observed that if frequency increases by approximately 10 GHz, the percentage increase in the attenuation at New Delhi would be approximately 38% respectively. The preliminary results are encouraging and may be utilized to conduct the attenuation studies for forthcoming microwave frequency links in tropical regions in detailed manner for other spatial locations as well."

The model utilizes a non-linear mathematical function to reconstruct the underlying continuous land change process from temporally discrete satellite observations. Based on the coefficients of the mathematical function, the model simultaneously derives the timing, intensity and duration of land cover change. Moreover, the smoothing feature of the model can also be used to remove random noise in time-series land cover data and hence to re-establish the stable land cover states before and after change. We illustrate the application of the model by showing examples of characterizing deforestation using time-series MODIS data as well as characterizing urban land expansion using time-series Landsat data."

This paper described a novel instrument to get hyperspectral information from lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles for crop monitoring. The objectives of this study were to assess the data quality of one hyperspectral frame camera and evaluate the ability in rice nitrogen status monitoring. In this study, we introduced one hyperspectral frame camera weighing 470g which could be mounted to low-weight UAVs (<3 kg). The flight campaign was conducted in a paddy rice field in September 2015. During the flight, two ground-based portable spectrometers (ASD Field Spec Pro spectrometer and GreenSeeker RT 100) were used to collect rice canopy spectra. Later, Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from hyperspectral images was compared with that from GreenSeeker and ASD. Also, field sampling was taken at the same day with the flight, and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) was obtained through Kjeldahl digestion method. Five existing vegetation indices that were used for N detection were used to estimate LNC. Results are satisfactory, which lay a foundation for the promising application of UAV-based hyperspectral remote sensing on precision agriculture."

The resulting model is channel-decoupled, thus permitting the application to misregistered spectral data. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of the proposed method to preserve spatial details, reduce color artifacts, and avoid aliasing."

These are: (1) the increasing presence of the invasive Africanized Honey Bee (AHB); and (2) the spread of pests and diseases within managed European Honey Bee (EHB) populations that cause major loss of colonies (of which Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is the most recent). The primary objective of this research is to improve prediction of the equilibrium range of both the AHB and EHB within the U.S, and to determine the impact of both urbanization and climate change on this equilibrium range. This will be achieved through integration of: climate data; scale hive defined nectar flow measurements; nectar and pollen source distributions; as well as satellite-derived vegetation phenology."

The inquiry-based, hands-on activities and lesson plans are designed to help students understand the dynamics of polar ice sheets in sea level rise. IIB lessons help educators expand the environmental awareness of their students and serve as platforms for the teaching of scientific principles to fulfill the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The “Survival Unit” of the IIB program is an effective component because its lessons are focused on the people involved and their preparation for field work in the Polar Regions. IIB considers this to be an exciting and relatable area of interest, which may stimulate creativity and productivity among youth. Lessons show why explorers must develop awareness of and solutions for hazards such as ice thickness, frigid temperatures, and food scarcity. The lessons associated with these topics are designed to be inquiry-based, hands-on, and to meet the NGSS standards for school districts."
312578,21349,11104,"The Human Development Index and its relation to the irrigation projects on the Sao Francisco River Basin, Brazil",2004,"The Sao Francisco hydrographic basin comprises seven Brazilian States, representing almost 8% of the country's area, having also different landscapes and huge environmental diversity. The regions of the basin vary form those with high hydrological potentials to those with severe draughts. The irrigation projects on the Sao Francisco River Basin represent an economic growth vector to agricultural activities and agro industries. They would not reach full development under the high climatic risks that are characteristic of the semi-arid climate, which comprises major portions of the basin area. The CODEVASF Brazilian management company has 38 irrigation projects in operation, spread over 31 municipalities of the basin, 10 being implemented and another 10 subjected is viability studies. The objective of this article is to perform a multitemporal analysis, considering the influence of the projects to the economic development of the region. The methodological procedures can be described in three phases: (a) reground development analyses using the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) from 1970 to 2000, (b) analysis of the relations between projects implementation and the MHDI. The MHDI is based on factors like income, education and longevity. The MHDI informations were mapped in a GIS. After clustering the municipalities into the MHDI classes, there were introduced maps of the irrigation projects in operation on the basin. It is possible to state that the irrigation projects are not the only factors responsible for an increase in the MHDI in the municipalities along the basin, since all the municipalities showed an increase in the MHDI regardless the presence of the projects. However a significant growth in the MHDI is verified in those municipalities, which had irrigation projects. There is a strong correlation between the growths of the irrigation area with the MHDI. That shows the importance of the projects to the basin as well as the importance of CODEVASF as the head institution for the implementation of such initiatives."

835194,21349,9078,Random impulsive scan for lidar sampling,2012,"In this paper, we address the problem of sampling the LIDAR range map. The significance of this problem is based upon the fact that large datasets generated by sampling inefficiently impose storage, processing and transmission limitations. Current compression approaches addressing these issues rely on collecting large amounts of data to analyze and throw away the redundancies. Unfortunately, the sampling performed by these approaches is still inefficient. Our approach to compression consists instead, on using a random uniform impulsive scan sampling scheme with sampling densities depending on the surface complexity. Turns out that the number of scanned time-resolved waveforms required to achieve “good” approximations, needs to satisfy the bound equation, where equation is an estimator of the surface numerical rank. Such a bound allows one to sub-sample surfaces which are close to a low-rank space and update, on the fly, the sampling densities required to improve the quality of the approximation."

However, there is often a risk of the spatial mismatch between the observations of the satellite-sensor and the ground validation sites. Therefore the heterogeneity analysis of the ground-based sites, which can indicate the representativeness of the sites' observation, has been a basic and key stage in the whole process. The purpose of this paper is to analyses the heterogeneity of the ground sites based on the variogram function. In this study, the variograms of the eighteen sites in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) based on NDVI data were calculated to discuss the heterogeneities of these sites. Then according to the heterogeneity analysis results, these sites were leveled ground observation scale for validating satellite-derived LSTs."

This paper attempts to propose a simple, practical and automatic method to produce the ecosystem map in mountainous areas by fusing multi-source data and the related knowledge. The multi-source data included the 30m-resolution land cover map and the vegetation map of China (1∶1 000 000). Three fusion strategies were contained in the proposed approach: hard matching, buffer matching and merged categories matching. Meanwhile, the related spatial distribution knowledge and the law of spatial distance decay were used to determine the optimal vegetation type, when more than two vegetation types are matched simultaneously. Taking the Southwestern China as study area, a new 30m-resolution ecosystem map with 144 ecosystem types was generated by the proposed method, which was used to establish the red list of ecosystems and evaluate the condition of biodiversity in the White Paper: China's Biodiversity."
2959894,21349,11104,Remote sensing observations of phytoplankton bloom induced by an anti-cyclonic eddy,2016,Mesoscale eddies play an important role in the phytoplankton cycles by regulating nutrient concentration in upper oceanic layers. This study presents a phytoplankton bloom derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in October 2013 in the East/Japan Sea. The sea level anomaly data derived from space-borne altimeter show that the bloom is coincident with a stationary anti-cyclonic eddy. The spatial distribution of Chlorophyll-a concentration demonstrates the submesoscale dynamics in the periphery of the anti-cyclonic eddy is the main mechanism contributes to the bloom. A high wind event before the bloom acts as a trigger factor which brings the nutrients from depth to the surface through enhancing mixing and Ekman pumping. This paper presents a new perspective on the combining effects of wind and an anti-cyclonic eddy on primary production.

Column-averaged dry air mole fractions of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2) from Mar 2010 to May 2010 retrieved by ACOS, NIES, SRFP, OCFP and EMMA were used to investigate the characteristic. The results indicated a higher concentration around the desert than areas where little carbon dioxide is released from fossil fuel. Moreover, an almost equal pattern to areas with high co2 emission was found. From investigating results, it was concluded that it is likely there exists abnormal high carbon dioxide concentration around the desert from satellite observations.

2857029,21349,9078,Multiple features learning via rotation strategy,2016,"Images are usually represented by different groups of features, such as color, shape and texture attributes. In this paper, we propose a classification approach that integrates multiple features, such as spectral and spatial information. We refer this approach to multiple feature learning via rotation (MFL-R) strategy, which adopt a rotation-based ensemble method by using a data transformation approach. Five data transformation methods, including principal component analysis (PCA), neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE), linear local tangent space alignment (LLTSA), linearity preserving projection (LPP) and multiple feature combination via manifold learning and patch alignment (MLPA) are used in the MFL-R framework. Experimental results over two hyperspectral remote sensing images demonstrate that MFL-R with MLPA gains better performances and is not sensitive to the tuning parameters."

The approximate area of this salty lake is 5000 km 2  with average depth of 6 m. The Urmia Lake has shrunk dramatically due to several factors during last decades. In the Lake Urmia region a Cenozoic island arc complex within the Zagros Orogenic Belt was formed by northeastward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic plate beneath central Iran.

2969472,21349,11104,Array configuration optimization for one-dimensional nonuniform aperture synthesis radiometers,2016,"For one dimensional large aperture synthesis radiometers (ASRs), the low redundancy linear arrays (LRLAs) are usually the choice for the reason of the lowest system complexity. However, the number of LRLAs is very few, which makes the antenna arrangement of LRLAs inflexible. In this paper, the array configuration optimization for AFF-based nonuniform array is proposed. The AFF-based nonuniform array after the array configuration optimization is called the optimized nonuniform array (ONA). The method how to find out the ONAs is introduced. In numerical results, some examples of ONA are given. The numerical result demonstrates that the performance of ONAs is almost equivalent to LRLAs. Since the antenna positions of ONA are non-integers, in fact, the number of ONAs is infinite in theory, which can be a supplement to the LRLAs in practical applications."

These methodssearchforpixelsintheimagewithspectralcharacteristicsthatdiffer from the background. The most widespread detectiontest, the RX-detector, is based on the Mahalanobis distanceand on the background statistical characterization throughthe mean vector and the covariance matrix. Although non-Gaussiandistributionshavealreadybeenintroducedforback-ground modeling in Hyperspectral Imaging, the parametersestimation is still performed using the Maximum LikelihoodEstimates for Gaussian distribution. This paper describesrobust estimation procedures more suitable for non-Gaussianenvironment. Therefore, they can be used as plug-in estima-tors for the RX-detector leading to some great improvementin the detection process. This theoretical improvement hasbeen evidenced over two real hyperspectral images.Index Terms  hypespectral imaging, anomaly detec-tion, elliptical distributions, M-estimators1. INTRODUCTIONTarget detection (TD) and anomaly detection (AD) of mul-tidimensional signals have proved to be valuable techniquesin a wide range of applications, including search-and-rescue,surveillance, rare mineral and land mines detection, etc (seefor e.g. [1, 2]). TD aims to discover the presence of a specicsignal of interest (the target) among a set of signals. Statisti-calTDisbasedontheNeyman-Pearson(NP)criterion,whichmaximizes the probability of detection for a given probabil-ity of false alarm. AD is a special case of TD in which noa-priori target is provided. Hence, the goal of AD is to de-tect signals that are anomalous respect to the background.The Reed-Xiaoli (RX) AD algorithm [3] is considered asthe benchmark algorithm in multidimensional AD. However,the RX detector performance strongly relies on the statisticalparameters estimation. Accordingly, when the backgroundis non-homogeneous or the noise independence assumptionis not fullled, the detector performance can be deteriorated.Here, we highlight a third drawback in the estimation prob-lems: the presence of outliers in the secondary data used forthe parameters estimation.In hyperspectral imaging, the actual distribution of the back-ground pixels differs from the theoretically predicted underGaussian hypothesis. In fact, as stated in [4], the empir-ical distribution usually has heavier tails compared to theGaussian distribution, and these tails strongly inuence theobserved false-alarm rate of the detector. One of the mostgeneral and acknowledged model for background statisticscharacterization is the family of Elliptically-Contoured Dis-tributions (ECD). They account for non-Gaussianity provid-ing a long tailed alternative to multivariate normal model.They are proven to represent a more accurate characteriza-tion of HSI than models based on Gaussian assumption [4].Although non-Gaussian distributions have already been as-sumed for background modeling, the parameters estimationis still performed using classical Gaussian based estimators;as in the case of covariance matrix, generally determined bythe Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) and the mean vectorwith the Sample Mean Vector (SMV). These classical esti-mators correspond to the Maximum Likelihood Estimators(MLE) for Gaussian assumption. However, they lead to sub-optimal detection schemes when the noise is a non-Gaussianprocess. When working on ECD framework the model canbe used to assess the robustness of statistical procedures andto derive alternative robust estimators of the parameters, themean vector and the covariance matrix [5, 6]. These can thenbe used as plug-in estimators in place of the unknown meanvector or/and of the covariance matrix. This is a simple butoften efcient method to obtain robust properties for signalprocessors derived under the Gaussian assumption.2. ELLIPTICALLY CONTOURED DISTRIBUTIONSHyperspectral data have been proven not to be multivariatenormal but long tailed distributed. In order to take into ac-count these features, the class of elliptically-contoured distri-butionsisconsideredtodescribeclutterstatisticalbehavior.

Particularly, soil fracturing constantly threatens infrastructure and water quality. Thus, monitoring its occurrence and propagation is paramount. In this work a methodology of analysis that allows identification of soil fractures and understanding of their dynamics is applied to the Penon del Marques area, southern ZMVM, where notable subsidence and associated fracturing take place.

Fortunately, Discrete Global Grid (DGG) gave a feasible solution, but it was only confined to the Earth surface, not reached to the Earth inside and outside, which was also very important to human activity. In this paper, a global three-dimensional (3D) grid, called as Spheoid Degenerated Octree Grid (SDOG), was presented, and two kinds of coding methods for SDOG, called as SDZ and MDZ, were proposed. The properties of SDOG were discussed and the performance of SDZ and MDZ was compared with QuaPA experimentally. It revealed that SDOG is a 3D grid with properties of global continuity, multi-hierarchy, similar shape and approximate size, and can serve well for global spatial data organizing and representing; SDZ and MDZ are high performance coding methods, and MDZ is a nicer choice for SDOG coding."

This task is particularly challenging when applied on such datasets as the available samples to train the decisioning system and formulate the query are insufficient (one image, few frames, or seconds of video recording). To cope with these challenges we investigate three established ensemble-based learning techniques, e.g., boosting, bagging and blending (stacking). Such methods are based on a set of procedures employed to train multiple learning algorithms and combine their outputs, while functioning together as a unified system of decision making. The approach was evaluated on two standard datasets (accounting for 16 people searching scenario on ca. 53000 labeled frames).

2923090,21349,11104,Implications of data placement strategy to Big Data technologies based on shared-nothing architecture for geosciences,2016,"It is found that data placement on the networked nodes of a cluster based on the shared-nothing architecture (SNA) should align in the physical (i.e. spatiotemporal) space for most geoscience Big Data analysis systems in order to minimize data movements and thus achieve optimal performance and efficiency. This is due to the fact that data analysis in geosciences predominantly requires spatiotemporal coincidence. If individual datasets are considered separately in their placement on the cluster nodes, these systems often have to move data between nodes when an analysis involves two or more datasets. In this paper, we first report our discoveries from a data placement alignment experiment with two Big Data technologies, SciDB and Spark+HDFS, and then elucidate some of the far-reaching implications of this discovery."

It is shown that the equations governing the scattering are described by a bilinear model, and can be approximated into finite dimensional spaces on the basis of the finite degrees of freedom of data, and that one can not expect to reconstruct an arbitrary function from a finite number of independent equations. As a consequence, a discrete model, well suited to numerical inversion, can be developed. The bilinear nature of the equations, and the suitable choice of the unknowns allow for the functional adopted in the estimation to be minimized in an accurate manner.

The bilinear operator equations governing the scattering are approximated into finite dimensional spaces on the basis of the finite degrees of freedom of data, and on the simple concept that one cannot expect to reconstruct an arbitrary function from a finite number of independent equations. As a consequence, a discrete model, well suited to numerical inversion, is developed. The particular bilinear nature of the equations, and a suitable choice of contrast and field unknowns allows the functional adopted in the estimation to be minimized in an accurate and numerically efficient manner.

1586042,21349,9078,Binary partition trees-based robust adaptive hyperspectral RX anomaly detection,2014,"The Reed-Xiaoli (RX) is considered as the benchmark algorithm in multidimensional anomaly detection (AD). However, the RX detector performance decreases when the statistical parameters estimation is poor. This could happen when the background is non-homogeneous or the noise independence assumption is not fulfilled. For a better performance, the statistical parameters are estimated locally using a sliding window approach. In this approach, called adaptive RX, a window is centered over the pixel under the test (PUT), so the background mean and covariance statistics are estimated using the data samples lying inside the window's spatial support, named the secondary data. Sometimes, a smaller guard window prevents those pixels close to the PUT to be used, in order to avoid the presence of outliers in the statistical estimation. The size of the window is chosen large enough to ensure the invertibility of the covariance matrix and small enough to justify both spatial and spectral homogeneity. We present here an alternative methodology to select the secondary data for a PUT by means of a binary partition tree (BPT) representation of the image. We test the proposed BPT-based adaptive hyperspectral RX AD algorithm using a real dataset provided by the Target Detection Blind Test project."
2901079,21349,11104,"Subsidence and sea level rise measurements for Houston and Galveston, Texas",2016,"The population growth rate in the Gulf of Mexico region is the highest in the United States. This area faces many natural hazards; sea level is rising, and as a result this region is experiencing coastal erosion, in some areas as much as 300 meters inland. Subsidence in conjunction with rapidly rising regional sea levels poses significant risks to coastal communities located within these regions now and in the foreseeable future. This research has investigated ground subsidence and rising sea-surface height occurring within the near vicinity of Galveston Bay by using radar altimetry, GPS, tide gauges, and extensometers. Results provided by radar altimetry found decadal variability (1992–2012) with average rates of sea level rise ranging between 3.0 and 4.0 mm/yr. Decomposition of this regions tide gauges by GPS regional norms are in strong agreement with trends computed from these altimetric sea level anomaly time series. In the vertical direction, the regions of Houston and Galveston were generally found to be stable. However, Seabrook and regions near the inlet of the Houston Ship Channel require continued monitoring due to recent rates of subsidence higher than surrounding areas and regional norms."
1422156,21349,9616,SUnGP: A Greedy Sparse Approximation Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing,2014,"Spectra measured at a pixel of a remote sensing hyper spectral sensor is usually a mixture of multiple spectra (end-members) of different materials on the ground. Hyper spectral unmixing aims at identifying the end members and their proportions (fractional abundances) in the mixed pixels. Hyper spectral unmixing has recently been casted into a sparse approximation problem and greedy sparse approximation approaches are considered desirable for solving it. However, the high correlation among the spectra of different materials seriously affects the accuracy of the greedy algorithms. We propose a greedy sparse approximation algorithm, called SUnGP, for unmixing of hyper spectral data. SUnGP shows high robustness against the correlation of the spectra of materials. The algorithm employees a subspace pruning strategy for the identification of the end members. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the state of the art greedy algorithms, its accuracy is comparable to the algorithms based on the convex relaxation of the problem, but with a considerable computational advantage."

We study the use of four Haralick features (energy, contrast, entropy, homogeneity) for texture analysis, and then perform the classification using the One-Against-All (OAA) multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is a popular supervised learning technique for classification. The choice of features (along with their corresponding parameters), the choice of the training set, and the choice of the SVM kernel highly affect the performance of the classification. The study was done on several CIR aerial images provided by the French National Forest Inventory (IFN). In this paper, we will show one example on a national forest near Sedan (in France), and compare our result with the IFN map."
2923162,21349,11104,Multi-way projections-based reconstruction for hyperspectral image denoising,2016,"In this paper, we propose a multi-way projections-based reconstruction method for noise reduction of hyperspectral image (HSI). Core ideas of the proposed method are twofold: 1) the original HSI is partitioned into many small three-dimensional (3D) patches. Each of the patch is taken as a third-order tensor, on which compressive multi-way measurements are performed; 2) denoised patches are produced by the approximate low multilinear-rank reconstructions, and the final denoised HSI can be obtained by putting the denoised patches back to where they are in the original HSI. Experiments conducted on the real hyperspectral data set demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method."
2923193,21349,11104,"Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth, so2 and NO2 over China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region during 2002–2013",2016,"With the rapid industrialization and urbanization in China, the great increases in anthropogenic emissions during the last decades have caused serious air pollution problems greatly influencing public health [1–2]. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, located in central-eastern China, is not only one of China's most economically developed and industrialized regions, but is the area that most frequently experiences haze episodes. In this study, the characteristics of spatial and temporal distribution and variation trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD) on 550 nm, SO2 and NO2 column density during 2002–2013 over BTH region were analyzed by using MODIS, OMI, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY satellite data [3–5]. With the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, the driving factors including motor vehicle ownership, electricity output, population and the construction area from the city statistical yearbooks are preliminary analyzed."
2933844,21349,11104,SAR based sea current estimation in the Naples coastal area,2016,Feasibility of derivation of sea surface currents from SAR images has been already shown in several experiments. To our knowledge no examples are provided with reference to sites such as Mediterranean coastal areas where the sea surface currents are characterized by lower intensities. In this work we investigate the possibility to exploit SAR data in the coastal area around Naples where archives of regularly acquired data are available.
763495,21349,11104,Architectures for independent test data review on NPOESS VIIRS,2010,"The presence of an on-site data clerk team proved to be a lowcost, effective method for VIIRS test data distribution. As opposed to a strictly electronic distribution path, the human data clerk component was always on-hand to obtain and organize relevant test procedure as-run documents, and various other shift logs, test logs, and test reports. It was the data clerk's responsibility to locate data, find documents, manage the data flow process, and serve any requests from the sensor scientist teams. The data clerks served a program librarian role, allowing government sensor scientists to concentrate on data analysis rather than how or where to find the necessary data and documentation."
1351340,21349,9078,SVM with feature selection and smooth prediction in images: Application to CAD of prostate cancer,2014,"We propose a new computer-aided detection scheme for prostate cancer screening on multiparametric magnetic resonance (mp-MR) images. Based on an annotated training database of mp-MR images from thirty patients, we train a novel support vector machine (SVM)-inspired classifier which simultaneously learns an optimal linear discriminant and a subset of predictor variables (or features) that are most relevant to the classification task, while promoting spatial smoothness of the malignancy prediction maps. The approach uses a l 1 -norm in the regularization term of the optimization problem that rewards sparsity. Spatial smoothness is promoted via an additional cost term that encodes the spatial neighborhood of the voxels, to avoid noisy prediction maps. Experimental comparisons of the proposed l 1 -Smooth SVM scheme to the regular l 2 -SVM scheme demonstrate a clear visual and numerical gain on our clinical dataset."
2933690,21349,11104,Dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral images with local geometric structure Fisher analysis,2016,"Marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) exploits the margin criterion to compact the intraclass data and separate the interclass data, and it is very useful to analyze the high-dimensional data. However, MFA just considers the structure relationship of neighbor points, and it cannot effectively represent the intrinsic structure of hyperspectral image (HSI) that possesses many homogenous areas. In this paper, we proposed a new dimensionality reduce (DR) model, termed local geometric structure Fisher analysis (LGSFA), for HSI classification. At first, this method computes the reconstruction point of each point with its intraclass neighbor points. Then, an intrinsic graph and a penalty graph are constructed to reveal the intraclass and interclass relationship, respectively. Finally, the neighbor points and corresponding reconstruction points are used to enhance the intraclass compactness and interclass separability in low-dimensional space. LGSFA can effectively reveal the intrinsic manifold structure and obtains the discriminating feature of HSI data. Experiments on Salinas HSI data set show that the proposed LGSFA algorithm performs the best classification results than other state-of-the-art methods."
2113215,21349,9078,Low-complexity lossy compression of hyperspectral images via informed quantization,2010,"Lossy compression of hyperspectral and ultraspectral images is traditionally performed using 3D transform coding. This approach yields good performance, but the complexity and memory requirements make it unsuitable for onboard compression. In this paper we propose a low-complexity lossy compression scheme based on prediction, quantization and rate-distortion optimization. The scheme employs coset codes coupled with the newconcept of “informed quantization”, and requires no entropy coding. The performance of the resulting algorithm is competitive with that of state-of-the-art 3D transform coding schemes, but the complexity is immensely lower, making it suitable for onboard compression at high throughputs."
626587,21349,8502,Using attribute trees to analyse auroral appearance over Canada,2002,"Modern space research uses both satellite-born and ground-based instruments to measure the near-Earth space environment. Studying the auroral display provides information of the electric currents in the ionosphere, which is why automated imaging stations capture millions of auroral all-sky images every year. However, due to the nature of the aurora, these images are difficult to analyse automatically: photon-limited images are noisy, and objects are irregular and difficult to identify. We used hierarchical attribute trees in a large scale experiment with over 350,000 auroral all-sky images. Tree-to-tree distances were utilised in classifying images and in locating similar images in content-based image retrieval fashion."
2933921,21349,11104,Hazardous and Noxious Substance detection by hyperspectral imagery for marine pollution application,2016,"In this paper we show that hyperspectral imaging systems are able to improve the detection and characterization Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) in the case of marine pollution. We analysed nadir hyperspectral image acquisitions from 0.4 to 12µm corresponding to two different campaigns: (i) HNS release at the surface of a sea water pool; (ii) HNS release in the Mediterranean Sea under real conditions where hyperspectral sensors were used in addition to existing systems operationally deployed for coastal survey. The spatial and temporal evolution of hyperspectral data of HNS slicks acquired from these campaigns show that hyperspectral imaging from visible to longwave infrared is sensitive to various chemical products due to their refractive index, specific absorption, or evaporating gas. Such sensitivity seems to be very helpful to identify the various products or to collect evidence of chemical pollution."
2901034,21349,11104,Solving structured segmentation of aerial images as puzzles,2016,"Traditional approaches to structured semantic segmentation employ appearance-based classifiers to provide a class-likelihood at each spatial location and then post-process it with Markov Random Fields (MRF) to enforce label smoothness and structure in the output space. The spatial support for such techniques is usually a patch of pixels, which makes the prediction over-smoothed because the borders of objects are not explicitly taken into account. This is further exacerbated by MRF post-processing employing the standard Potts model, which tends to further over-smooth predictions at boundaries. In this paper, we propose a different but related approach: we optimize an energy function finding the optimal combination of small ground truth (GT) tiles from training data over predictions at test time, effectively solving a puzzle. We optimize over a first configuration given by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) output."
2923255,21349,11104,Error entropy model based determination of minimum detactable deformation magnitude of terrestrial laser scanning,2016,"Deformation is typically estimated by comparing scans of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) over the same area but at different time instants. However, such a method can only estimate the difference between two successive surveys, which may be caused by instrumental error and registration error instead of the real deformation, affecting the reliability of deformation monitoring. In order to improve the reliability of TLS-based deformation monitoring, it is necessary to estimate the errors in TLS measurements and determine the precursory displacements that can be detected. In this paper, the error entropy model is exploited for inspecting the threshold value in deformation monitoring, i.e. the minimum detectable deformation magnitude of a TLS. The experimental results demonstrate that deformation greater than the threshold calculated by the proposed error entropy based method can be reliably detected."

The TGV adaptive regularize different image regions at different levels and the Shearlet transform can efficiently represent image anisotropic features such as edges, curves. A new image restoration model combining TGV and Shearlet transform is proposed for image restoration. The proposed model is solved by splitting variables and applying the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively restore image and improve the quality."
2733485,21349,9078,Hyperspectral classification using a composite kernel driven by nearest-neighbor spatial features,2015,"There is increasing interest in driving supervised classification of hyperspectral imagery by a support vector machine using a composite kernel employing both spectral and spatial features. While the spectral signature of the current hyperspectral pixel is often used directly to supply the spectral feature, a statistic—such as the mean—calculated across a spatial window surrounding the pixel is typically employed as a spatial feature. In contrast, a nearest-neighbor spatial feature is proposed in which the nearest neighbors in Euclidean distance to the current pixel are used to calculate the spatial feature. It is argued that the proposed nearest-neighbor spatial feature is more likely to incorporate relevant, sameclass neighbor pixels than window-based features for which borders between coherent single-class regions may give rise to misclassification. Experimental results illustrate the performance advantage of the proposed nearest-neighbor framework at supervised hyperspectral classification in comparison to several competing benchmark algorithms that also employ kernel-based support vector machines."

First, the enhanced sparsity based on &#x1D459; 1 −&#x1D459; 2  norm is explored to depict the intrinsic sparse characteristic of the fractional abundances in sparse regression unmixing model. By taking the correlation between hyperspectral pixels into account, total variation is minimized to enforce the spatial smoothness.

Experimental results on simulated and real hyperspectral datasets validate the excellent performances of the proposed method."
2923190,21349,11104,"Automatically texture extraction, mapping and 3D visualizaiton of buildings facades based on high resolution aerial photos",2016,"True orthoimage (TOM) was proposed to solve the problems that DOM generation encountered with high resolution images in urban areas, especially in the areas with high buildings. The correct positions of roof texture are located with the detection of the occlusion and shadows. However, the wall texture is missing after true orthoimage generation. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a method for automatically texture extraction, mapping and 3D visualization of buildings facades based on high resolution aerial photos. There are four major steps: 1) Visibility judgment based on occlusion detection and angle; 2) Optimal texture source selection; 3) Real texture extraction and mapping of building facades; 4) 3D visualization with real texture of building facades. This research can largely reduce workload and provides reference and guidance for applying high resolution images to generate real 3D urban reconstruction."
1528564,21349,11104,Multi-sensor PSI analysis of deformation in Lesina Marina (Southern Italy),2015,"Marina di Lesina is a peculiar geological site, affected by sinkhole phenomena, causing instabilities and failures of infrastructures. This tourist village, lying not far from Punta delle Pietre Nere, the only outcrop of magmatic rock in the Mediterranean basin, sits on a diapir made of Triassic gypsum, mantled by Quaternary sandy deposits. The cutting of the artificial Acquarotta canal in 1930, connecting the nearby Lesina lagoon to the Mediterranean Sea, exposed this grey micro and meso-crystalline gypsum with intercalations of black limestones and marls. This event is a likely cause for the formation of dissolutional conduits and cavities, found in the area, leading to the formation of the sinkholes which have been plaguing the site in the last years [1]. This peculiar geological setting, coupled with its relatively high value as a local touristic resort, led to its selection as a test site for precise InSAR displacement monitoring techniques. The monitoring, started with legacy ERS and ENVISAT sensors, is continuing through analysis of higher-resolution data."

2959879,21349,11104,Constrained multiple band selection for hyperspectral imagery,2016,"A recent developed band selection, called constrained band selection (CBS), makes use of constrained energy minimization (CEM) to constrain a single band to calculate its priority for band selection (BS). This paper extends such CEM-BS to a constrained multiple band selection (CMBS)-based method, to be called linearly constrained minimum variance multiple band-constrained selection (CMBS), which uses LCMV to constrain multiple bands to perform band subset selection. Since CMBS selects multiple bands as a band subset as a whole it does not require band prioritization (BP) or band de-correlation (BD) as traditional band selection (BS) usually does. However, CMBS is traded for one challenging issue, which is excessive computational complexity because it requires running through a total number of subsets in the power set of a full band set compared to BS which only needs to select one band at a time. In order to avoid exhaustive search for all band subsets in it power set, a sequential CMBS, successive CMBS (SC-CMBS) is developed to ease computational complexity."

Through the adoption and adaptation process, the general big data technologies are very useful in agro-geoinformatics, but cannot solve all technology needs in dealing with big agro-geodata. Development of agro-specific big data technology is a necessary supplement to adoption of general big data technology. The combination of adoption of general big data technology and development of agro-specific big data technology proves to be a good strategy for applying big data technology in agro-geoinformatics."
2923043,21349,11104,Urbanization of Weihai area in Shandong province analyzed by archived Landsat data,2016,"Intensive transformation of landscape has taken place in Weihai, Shandong province. This gave us the idea to investigate the urban development in this area by the use of archived satellite data, available for the last 30 years. We utilized advanced processing schemes to geometrically correct and spectrally calibrate about 60 cloud free frames of Landsat data available from 1984 to 2015. We used different classifiers to extract and model relevant parameters and provide information layers that display the changes and trends incl. robust statistics for the area. These information layers are finally analyzed and interpreted. Our findings confirm a tremendous increase of housing and industrial areas of 6.56% locally and 10% for the entire Weihai area within the last 10 years and also indicate new investments as drivers for the urbanization."

The main objective of this exploratory study is to find the best three relevant bands to create a RGB image that maximizes the contrast between the target tissue and its surroundings. One of the main challenges in HSI processing is the dimensionality reduction step which was carried out using band transformation and band selection methods in order to remove redundancy in the collected data without losing valuable information. Preclinical experiments were performed in vivo in a porcine ureter. Objective and comparative evaluations, based on the simulated perceived image, were performed between five methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method that combines two band selection methods has the best performance to enhance surgeon's visual skills."
716259,21349,8502,Estimating the spatial extents of geospatial objects using hierarchical models,2012,"The goal of this work is to estimate the spatial extents of complex geospatial objects such as high schools and golf courses. Gazetteers are deficient in that they currently specify the spatial extents of these objects using a single latitude/longitude point. We propose a framework that uses readily available high resolution overhead imagery to estimate the boundaries of known object instances in order to update the gazetteers. Key to our approach is a hierarchical object model with three levels. The lowest level characterizes an object using local invariant features; an intermediate, latent level characterizes the land-use/land-cover (LULC) classes that constitute an object; and, the top level models an object as a distribution over these classes. We evaluate our approach using a manually labeled ground truth dataset of four object types: high schools, golf courses, mobile home parks, and Costco shopping centers."
2160771,21349,9078,Tensor completion for on-board compression of hyperspectral images,2010,"We present a new image compression scheme for hyperspectral images based on the newly-emerged matrix/tensor completion theory. Unlike typical transform-coding based methods, the proposed approach does not require any transform to be performed by the imaging sensor when doing on-board compression. Only a small set of pixels on a sparse set of locations on the imaging sensor needs to be captured and transmitted for each image. The decoder side relies on matrix/tensor completion for reconstructing the original images. Hence the scheme can drastically reduce the computation and bandwidth requirements on the on-board imaging sensors. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to obtain compression performance close to JPEG2000 while enjoying the afore-mentioned unique benefits."
2107014,21349,9078,Structure-preserving speckle reduction of SAR images using nonlocal means filters,2009,"This paper proposes a structure-preserving speckle reduction (SPSR) algorithm for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by exploiting self-similarity of structural patterns based on nonlocal means filter. The SPSR algorithm is featured by discerning pixels of similar structural patterns, which is crucial for a despeckling process to avoid blurring image structure. To alleviate the impact of speckle noise to similarity measure, a two-stage filtering scheme is introduced into the SPSR algorithm. Filtering at the first stage aims at an accurate approximation of true structural similarity, followed by the filtering at the second stage to group pixels with similar neighborhood in a large area. Compared to the traditional Lee filter, enhanced Lee filter and the speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD), evaluation results have shown that the SPSR algorithm substantially improves the despeckling performance especially on structure preservation and speckle reduction in homogeneous regions."

The city has expanded to a high percentage but is still characterized by a huge number of lakes and surrounding coastal waters (case-II). In the study, we investigated the temperature changes of those lakes and the coastal zones as well as of some features at land over the past 20 years. We were able to measure subtle changes and trends considering the background of global warming issues by 1.4 degree within this time span. First of all, advanced processing schemes are utilized to conduct the necessary geometric correction and radiometric calibration of the data. In a second step, data have to be converted from DN values to emittance and finally to temperature values. Data are analyzed, and results of temperature changes and trends of different lakes and coastal waters are displayed and visualized together with robust statistical data in digital form. Results are finally interpreted and may be compared to other data sources such as fixed measuring points on the ground or results at other regions eventually at different latitudes."
2910291,21349,11104,Sparse representation based subpixel information extraction framework for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery,2016,"Sparse representation theory has become a powerful tool since it can obtain the sparsest or the unique solution for the underdetermined problem with the development of linear algebra, optimization, scientific computing and more. As subpixel information extraction encountered in hyperspectral remote sensing, which contains many mixed pixels, are famous under-determined ill-posed problem. In addition, there is no unified model to conquer the problems with the subpixel analysis techniques, i.e., spectral unmixing and subpixel mapping. To cope with this under-determined problem, a unified sparse subpixel information extraction framework was proposed in this paper, which connects sparse unmixing and sparse subpixel mapping methods in a unified theoretical system as a serious of sparse regression problem. The experimental results with hyperspectral images indicate that the proposed sparse representation framework outperforms the previous subpixel analysis approaches, hence, provides an effective option for subpixel information extraction idea for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery."

1801383,21349,9616,Automatic Building Detection in Aerial Images Using a Hierarchical Feature Based Image Segmentation,2010,This paper introduces a novel automatic building detection method for aerial images. The proposed method incorporates a hierarchical multilayer feature based image segmentation technique using color. A number of geometrical/regional attributes are defined to identify potential regions in multiple layers of segmented images. A tree-based mechanism is utilized to inspect segmented regions using their spatial relationships with each other and their regional/geometrical characteristics. This process allows the creation of a set of candidate regions that are validated as rooftops based on the overlap between existing and predicted shadows of each region according to the image acquisition information. Experimental results show an overall shape accuracy and completeness of 96%.

Narrow-band simple ratio water index (SRWI), simple difference water index (DWI) and normalized difference indices (NDWI) were calculated respectively for both VNIR and TIR spectra. According to correlation analysis and model validation, it is found that (1) the VNIR proved highly sensitive spectral region and hold promise for the estimation of leaf water content, and (2) SRWIVNIR is the most accurate index for the retrieval of leaf water content of maize seedlings (R 2  = 0.78, RMSE = 2.52%)."

A novel method for determining the material spectra from within the scene, AGES, is proposed based on the positional information contained within abundances generated by additivity-constrained inversion. This new approach is compared on both simulated and real data sets to the well established N-FINDR algorithm, comparing favorably in terms of computational complexity with the existing algorithm without significantly sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the algorithm has some desirable properties inherent in such an approach."
728433,21349,11104,Urban land cover mapping with TerraSAR-X using an edge-aware region-growing and merging algorithm,2014,"The objective of this licentiate thesis is to develop novel algorithms and improve existing methods for urban land cover mapping and urban extent extraction using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. Past studies have demonstrated that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have very good properties for the analysis of urban areas, the synergy of SAR and optical data is advantageous for various applications. The specific objectives of this research are:1. To develop a novel edge-aware region-growing and -merging algorithm, KTH-SEG, for effective segmentation of SAR and optical data for urban land cover mapping;2. To evaluate the synergistic effects of multi-temporal ENVISAT ASAR and HJ-1B multi-spectral data for urban land cover mapping;3. To improve the robustness of an existing method for urban extent extraction by adding effective pre- and post-processing.ENVISAT ASAR data and the Chinese HJ-1B multispectral , as well as TerraSAR-X data were used in this research. For objectives 1 and 2 two main study areas were chosen, Beijing and Shanghai, China. For both sites a number of multitemporal ENVISAT ASAR (30m C-band) scenes with varying image characteristics were selected during the vegetated season of 2009. For Shanghai TerraSAR-X strip-map images at 3m resolution X-band) were acquired for a similar period in 2010 to also evaluate high resolution X-band SAR for urban land cover mapping. Ten major landcover classes were extracted including high density built-up, low density built-up, bare field, low vegetation, forest, golf course, grass, water, airport runway and major road.For Objective 3, eleven globally distributed study areas where chosen, Berlin, Beijing, Jakarta, Lagos, Lombardia (northern Italy), Mexico City, Mumbai, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm and Sydney. For all cities ENVISAT ASAR imagery was acquired and for cities in or close to mountains even SRTM digital elevation data.The methodology of this thesis includes two major components, KTH-SEG and KTH-Pavia Urban Extractor. KTH-SEG is an edge aware region-growing and -merging algorithm that utilizes both the benefit of finding local high frequency changes as well as determining robustly homogeneous areas of a low frequency in local change. The post-segmentation classification is performed using support vector machines. KTH-SEG was evaluated using multitemporal, multi-angle, dual-polarization ASAR data and multispectral HJ-1B data as well as TerraSAR-X data. The KTH-Pavia urban extractor is a processing chain. It includes: Geometrical corrections, contrast enhancement, builtup area extraction using spatial stastistics and GLCM texture features, logical operator based fusion and DEM based mountain masking.For urban land cover classification using multitemporal ENVISAT ASAR data, the results showed that KTH-SEG achieved an overall accuracy of almost 80% (0.77 Kappa ) for the 10 urban land cover classes both Beijign and Shanghai, compared to eCognition results of 75% (0.71 Kappa) In particular the detection of small linear features with respect to the image resolution such as roads in 30m resolved data went well with 83% user accuracy from KTH-SEG versus 57% user accuracy using the segments derived from eCognition. The other urban classes which in particular in SAR imagery are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity were classified superiorly by KTH-SEG. ECognition in general performed better on vegetation classes such as grass, low vegetation and forest which are usually more homogeneous.It is was also found that the combination of ASAR and HJ-1B optical data was beneficial, increasing the final classification accuracy by at least 10% compared to ASAR or HJ-1B data alone. The results also further confirmed that a higher diversity of SAR type images is more important for the urban classification outcome. However, this is not the case when classifying high resolution TerraSAR-X strip-map imagery. Here the different image characteristics of different look angles, and orbit orientation created more confusion mainly due to the different layover and foreshortening effects on larger buildings. The TerraSAR-X results showed also that accurate urban classification can be achieved using high resolution SAR data alone with almost 84% for eight classes around the Shanghai international Airport (high and low density built-up were not separated as well as roads and runways).For urban extent extraction, the results demonstrated that built-up areas can be effectively extracted using a single ENVISAT ASAR image in 10 global cities reaching overall accuracies around 85%, compared to 75% of MODIS urban class and 73% GlobCover Urban class. Multitemporal ASAR can improve the urban extraction results by 5-10% in Beijing. Mountain masking applied in Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro increased the accuracy by 3-5%.The research performed in this thesis has contributed to the remote sensing community by providing algorithms and methods for both extracting urban areas and identifying urban land cover in a more detailed fashion."

In order to enhance biophysical and biochemical properties of canopy species, a set of vegetation indices were computed. These indices served as input for a region growing segmentat ion algorithm that takes into account mutual similarity of pixels and spectral separability between neighbor segments. Segmentation output was evaluat ed on the basis of a score computed with the proportion of the area of the segments located within manuall y delineated ITCs . Results show that the segmentation approach is able to automatically delineate up to 70% of the control ITCs.

INTRODUCTION Hyperspectral remote ly sens ed data provide important information for management and conservation of tropical forests. In this context , research ha s been developed on tree species discrimination at both leaf - and canopy -levels [1 ]-[3] . At the canopy -level, due to unique spectral signatures of tree species , the focus has been on pixel -based classification approaches. However, studies performed at the individual tree crow n (ITC) level had reported higher classification accuracies [1 ],[2],[4]. ITC s are often manually delineated using high spatial resolution images [1] , since tree crow ns, particularly from emergent species , are easily distinguishable. Although this method produces satisfactory results , it is labor intensive and therefore unfeasi ble over large areas. A utomatic ITC delineation in tropical forests is a challenging task because of the vegetation stands structure . Trees have often no n-uniform heights and overlapping crowns, which makes the distinction of clear boundaries between individuals very difficult, even in sub -meter resolution images. Moreover, effects of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) caused by crown architecture , view and illumination ang les lead to different proportions of shaded and illumin ated pixels within the same ITC. Nevertheless, the information present in hyperspectral images can be exploited to reduce such effects , and enhance spectral features contributing to an improved ITC delineation. In this work, we propose a method for automatic delineation of tree crowns, in a tropical forest area, using a region growing segmentation algorithm designed specifically for this task . The h igh dimensionality of hyperspectral data was reduced into a set of vegetation indices (VI) to enhance b iophysical and biochemical features of semi -deciduous tree species. The segmentation algorithm took into account, through a spectral separability measure between segments, the contribution of VIs on the automatic ITC delineation process. 2.

661365,21349,11104,Recursive data processing and data volume minimization for PS-InSAR,2005,"PS-InSAR has proven to be an accurate and ef- ficient technique for the joint estimation of topographic and displacement signal from stacked interferometric combinations. In this contribution a new method for PS-Insert processing is introduced, which enables the recursive estimation of parameters of interest. The method is based on the ILSQ PS-InSAR concept and makes use of the estimation vector and corresponding variance-covariance matrix of the initial estimation epoch. The presented methodology systematically adds a new acquisition (or set of acquisitions) to the existing stack, updates the solution of the previous run, and analyzes whether the behaviour of the (pre-) selected points fits the expected one. This contribution focuses on a mathematical framework, rather then on specific applicational problems. Nevertheless, the performed numerical analysis on simulated data sets is analyzed and discussed, which shows that the preset aims of the recursive PS-InSAR estimation technique is achieved. I. INTRODUCTION Time series InSAR analysis using persistent scatterer (PS) techniques aims at the joint estimation of topographic and displacement signal from a number of interferometric com- binations, (1), (2). Since the estimates of both parameters are correlated and error signal due to, e.g., atmospheric signal can significantly affect the adjustment, an accurate estimation depends on the availability of a large data stack, i.e., more than 20-30 images. A smaller number of images usually results in problems like detecting the potential PS, reducing the atmospheric signal, separating topography and displacement, and phase ambiguity estimation. An additional problem for all current multi-image pro- cessing concepts is that the parameter estimation is usually performed in batches, i.e., by using all available acquisitions at once. Hence, in order to incorporate a newly available acquisition into the processing chain, and consequently update the estimates, the whole processing (at least the PS part) has to be performed again. Such an approach consequently leads to an increase of processing time, limits the application to the areas where only a sufficient number of images is available, and reduces the potential application of the method to a semi- real-time deformation monitoring. The two main processing concepts of PS-InSAR are the concept of the ambiguity function, (1), and Integer Least Squares (ILSQ) method, (2). The main drawback of the first one is that the propagation concept of observations to the unknown parameters is suboptimal. Moreover, the method strongly depends on the discretization of the solution space and it treats unknown ambiguities as deterministic parameters instead of stochastic ones. The ILSQ approach is based on the principles of Best Linear Unbiased Estimation (BLUE) - it is based on the minimization of the mean squared error and it is formulated as a constrained minimization problem on the integer nature of the unknowns, (6). By means of the ILSQ method, the quality description of estimated parameters is the one of the end products of the analysis, which can conse- quently be used to determine the significance and reliability of the estimated parameters. The ILSQ PS-InSAR processing framework sets the basis for a recursive data processing strategy, where new acquisi- tions can be easily added to an existing data stack, significantly reducing the computational requirements. This implies that the presented methodology systematically adds a new acquisition to the existing stack, updates the solution of the previous run, and analyzes whether the behaviour of the (pre-)selected points fits to the expected behaviour of parameters of interest. If not, an alternative hypothesis is tested against the prior solution, leading to the rejection of the point, adaptation of the model, or manual intervention. For the conditions on the practical application of recursive PS-InSAR processing, it can be referred to the block-diagonal structure of the variance-covariance matrix of the introduced recursive model (the estimates from the initialization run and phase observations of the additional acquisition are assumed to be uncorrelated). Secondly, the atmospheric and non-modelled displacement contributions to the interferometric phase have to be modelled and incorporated into the variance matrix by means of covariance functions, (4), (5) - in the presented study the covariance functions are not further elaborated on. Moreover, in numerical experiments, phase contributions are isolated by low-pass filtering in the spatial domain and high- pass filtering in the temporal domain. Furtheron, in order to correctly perform the initialization run (candidate selection and unwrapping), a sufficient number of images (15-20) is needed. In the following sections the concept of the recursive PS- InSAR is presented. Examples on simulated data are used"
1872271,21349,11104,Enterprise IT support for NOAA archives,2007,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for archiving and disseminating environmental data collected by a variety of ground and space-based observing systems. Integrating data management across NOAA represents a significant change in NOAA business practices that will require evolution of the management structures and approaches used in NOAA for data management. Historically, archive and dissemination activities have been implemented in dedicated stovepipe systems, each focusing on the needs of a particular data collection and its associated user community. Exponential data volume growth, increasing data diversity, user requirements for common and consistent access methods across data types, and the need for economic efficiency are driving a consolidation of the information technology (IT) systems that support NOAA archives. The Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) is a result of this consolidation; CLASS is the enterprise IT solution in support of NOAA archives. Against this backdrop, the meaning of archive is itself changing as the challenges of long-term digital preservation are better understood. It is no longer sufficient to simply preserve bits. Instead, information content is the target of preservation, with bits simply providing a medium for representing information. The ISO standard Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS-RM) provides a conceptual framework that describes the responsibilities and activities of organizations attempting to preserve digital information. Applying the OAIS-RM to NOAA's archive efforts provides the means to identify high-level archive responsibilities, delegate roles to various NOAA organizational components, and describe the means by which these entities work together to fulfill archive requirements. At the highest level, NOAA archives maintain and apply information- and user-specific knowledge while CLASS provides IT capabilities in support of archive activities. Together, the archives and CLASS provide the necessary ingredients to fulfill NOAA's archive mission. Currently, CLASS holds POES, DMSP, GOES, and MetOp data. Planned future campaigns include NPP, NPOESS, EOS MODIS, NEXRAD, and model and in-situ data. To ensure the preservation of these data, CLASS has implemented a multiple site distributed system that replicates data and metadata holdings automatically. Additionally, CLASS supports the deployment of points of presence that allow the co-location of key CLASS capabilities with high-volume or otherwise critical data producers or consumers to mitigate economic constraints or meet quality-of-service requirements. Among the key challenges facing CLASS are: massive increases in data volumes, the extraordinary diversity of NOAA data, evolving user needs and requirements, and the ever-changing technology environment. CLASS must address all of these challenges - and more - at the same time it ensures the safeguarding and availability of its current holdings. CLASS is evolving toward a service-oriented architecture that provides the flexibility, scalability, and generality necessary to accommodate the vast amount of change in its environment and at the same time provide interoperability with other systems and systems of systems necessary to support NOAA's position in the environmental data arena. Adoption of standards is critical to NOAA's success, and CLASS is working with NOAA's Global Earth Observation Integrated Data Environment (GEO-IDE) project to identify standards that will ensure CLASS'S interoperability with other NOAA systems. The lack of broad, uniform utilization of IT standards that adequately meet NOAA's data integration needs is arguably the most acute factor contributing to the weakness of data integration today. GEO-IDE will ultimately ensure that key NOAA systems, including CLASS, are interoperable within NOAA, with US-Global Earth Observation System (US-GEO), and ultimately with US-Global Earth Observation System (GEOSS). In addition to its work with GEO-IDE, CLASS is also developing pilots for geospatial capabilities, and dissemination standards to facilitate interoperability and meet user needs. This paper will present the guiding principles and lessons learned while developing CLASS to date. We will discuss our challenges, accomplishments, and future work, as well as how CLASS aligns with NOAA's strategic goals."
2009419,21349,11104,Implementation of Differential Repeat-pass SAR Interferometry for the Search for Earthquake Precursory Land-cover Deformation in Taiwan,2006,"Worldwide, medium- to short-term earthquake prediction is becoming ever more essential for safeguarding man due to an un-abating population increase, but hitherto there have been no verifiable methods of reliable earthquake prediction developed - except for a few isolated examples of earthquake prediction in China and in Greece. This dilemma is a result of previous and still current approaches to earthquake prediction which are squarely based on the measurement of crustal movements, observable only after a tectonic stress-change discharge (earthquake) has occurred. The prediction models were derived from past histories of measurements, mainly carried out during the past 30 - 40 years, although initiated soon after the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. During the past decade it was proved and shown that it is not possible to derive reliable models for earthquake predictions from crustal movement measurements alone, and that an entirely new approach must be taken and rigorously pursued over years and decades to come. In support of this conclusion, there have been reported throughout the history of man anecdotal historical up to scientifically verifiable earthquake precursor or seismo-genic signatures of various kind - biological, geological, geo-chemical and especially a rather large plethora of diverse electromagnetic ones on ground, in air and space, denoted as seismo- electromagnetic signatures. The existence of all of these signatures can no longer be denied even by the fiercest seismological expert opponents; and it is absolutely high noon that those signatures be more rigorously assessed in order to develop a strategy for designing and carrying out controlled seismo-genic and seismo-electromagnetic studies on how to set up world-wide a network of measurement sites for conducting a holistic set of measurements for providing an improved understanding on why and how such precursor signatures are generated, and how and where those may best be observed subject to the rather poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), requiring much improved digital instrumentation as time goes on due to the ever increasing man-made electromagnetic noise generation. A number of pilot studies had been initiated, had been supported for a few years, and then aborted because of the high operating costs involved, the poor SNR making signal detection tedious if not impossible with the current state of the art in instrumentation, and because earthquakes don't appear upon demand. For example such major studies as the USGS/NSF NEHER Program of the early 1990's after the Loma Prieta M 7 earthquake of 1987; in Japan the ERSFP after the Kobe Earthquake of 1995; in Greece the ongoing electro-potentialmethods of Varatsov; in China, and in various regions as well as independent states of the former Soviet Union. There exists a rather large number of fiercely competing groups in Russia coming up with their own diversified yet highly incomplete modeling approaches seeking support from the West for unfortunately all too low-cost scientific mercenary services. No clear picture has evolved and should not be expected; and a much wider internationally coordinated investigation is required, which may well last for several decades before a unified approach and with it a solution to this vital problem may be found - if ever. In this overview a systematic analysis of main historical records, a summary of pertinent seimo-genic as well as observed seismo- electromagnetic effects and modern ground-based to air- and space-borne metrological signature investigations are presented. Specifically, remote sensing techniques not yet conceived but in urgent need - such as the remote sensing of the groundwater table - for advancing our understanding of this highly interdisciplinary complicated geophysical problem are being identified, and input is sought from participants for possible active future involvement."
1804712,21349,11104,Leaf Area Index Estimation using Lidar and Forest Reflectance Modelling of Airborne Hyperspectral Data,2008,"Insect-induced damages in forests are a major concern for timber production, landscape conservation and ecosystem research. Early detection methods based on remote sensing data can document the severity and spatial extent of ongoing attacks and might aid in designing mitigation measures or even prevention where necessary. In southeastern Norway, a large-scale insect defoliation of pine trees is ongoing. The larvae of the Pine sawfly Neodiprion sertifer create it with its mass attacks during their feeding on needles in June and July. In the winter before the attack, egg galleries are evident in the needles. This provides a test case for early detection methods and remote sensing techniques for monitoring forest health. In the context of an ongoing project on REMote sensing of FORest health (REM-FOR) in Norway, we approach this problem by mapping leaf area index (LAI) before and after the attack in a test area (size around 20 km 2 ). LAI is used as a proxy for the crown density, and decreasing trends not related to phenology (non-periodic) indicate defoliation. Estimates for effective LAI for two different years, 2005 and 2007, were derived using airborne laser scanning (LIDAR) calibrated with ground-based point measurements with the LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-CORreg, USA). These estimates are based on an application of the Beer-Lambert law and a threshold-based separation of laser reflections from the ground and from the canopy. We also obtained airborne high-resolution hyperspectral images (HySpex TM , Norsk Elektrooptikk, Norway) for the same reference years to investigate the spectral response of the affected forest. The set of two cameras deliver 330 different spectral channels in the wavelength range 400 to 1800 nm. The analysis might be done using advanced multivariate methods or spectral unmixing using spectral libraries. Here, it was performed using a physically-based model emphasizing geometrical and optical properties of canopies, the Forest Reflectance Model FRT. FRT was designed for the application to (managed) Northern European Forests and is based on conventional forest inventory data, species-dependent parametrized crown shapes, canopy LAI, needle clumping index, and needle optical properties. Here, however, we run the model in an inverse mode, by iteratively minimizing the discrepancy between measured and simulated reflectances, and predicting the LAI, keeping well-constrained parameters of the model (e.g. tree density, tree height, optical properties of needles) fixed while calibrating others (e.g. needle weight per tree, average shoot length, shoot self-shading). A set of 14 sample trees felled in 2005 further constrain the range of the calibrated parameters, excluding local model inversion minima with unrealistic parameter estimates. The LAI values predicted by the model are then compared to those obtained with airborne laser-scanning with a spatial resolution of 20 m times 20 m for the pine- dominated part of the scenes. In doing so, the spectra from each pixel (size 25 cm times 25 cm) were aggregated by calculating channel-wise median values. In effect, the modelling setup results in determining geometrical and optical properties of forest plots, trees and needles from hyperspectral images. The project data are complemented by images from a range of satellite-based sensors, including MODIS, SPOT, and Hyperion to cover larger regions and as a basis for operationalizing the approach for future insect attacks."
786292,21349,11104,Assessment of satellite based vegetation land surface phenology algorithms with application to a 20 year NOAA AVHRR record over Canada and Northern USA.,2014,"ABSTRACT Land Surface phenology (LSP) is related to vegetation dynamics and is an indicator of tracking surface climate change. One of the challenges in the study of LSP is the validation of satellite based LSP products . Here, we have proposed a novel methodology of the validating LSP products by applying observed temporal gap and measurement noise to representative daily NDVI reference time series from satellite imagery . Three well -known LSP algorithms (iterative Savitzky -Golay filtering - SGF [1], Asymmetric Gaussian Fitting ± AGF [2] and Logistic fitting [3, 4]) are applied to 20 years of NOAA AVHRR mea surements over biomes in Canada and Northern USA . For a given AVHRR cloud threshold, both AGF and SGF are more sensitive to the amount of gaps than to the noise in the data. Index Terms ² time seri es, phenology, comparison, validation 1. INTRODUCTION Land Surface phenology (LSP) involves the study of seasonal pattern of variation in vegetated land surfaces from remote sensing obser vations [5]. LSP is related to vegetation phenology ± the study of the timings of recurrent plant cycle events that are driven by environmental factors [6], and to changes in surface climate. Due to its significance, many attempts have been made, over the years , to produce satellite based LSP products. The Committee of Earth Observation systems (CEOS) Working Group on Calibrat ion and Validation Land Surface Phenology indicators documents a large number ( >15) of LSP products derived through the application of different algorithms to satellite measurement time series [7]. Validation of LSP algorithms is challenging d ue to differences in : i) user requirements, ii) in-situ survey methods and quantities, iii) phenology metrics iv) spatial and temporal sampling of reference measurem ents etc. Validation studies can be broadly classified into those that compare satellite based LSP with in -situ measurements [8-11 ] and those that compare satellite LSP to reference estimates derived from the same or similar satellite datasets [12 -16 ]. We focus here on the latter. Hir d and McDermid [12 ] evaluated six LSP methods over selected biomes in West -Central Alberta, Canada for their sensitivity to the amount noise. Th ey created biome specific reference sa tellite phenology time series (REF) by averaging cloud free daily MODIS NDVI time series over ~100 pixels within a biome qualitatively judged to share a similar temporal profile . Phenology estimates , derived by applying thresholds to noisy NDVI time series over a member pixel based on a selected algorithm , were compared to the same processing applied to REF . Their stu dy introduced the concept of creating a reference noise free time series from the same observations used for LSP estimat ion . Howeve r, the ir approach has limitations : i) subjective criterion for selecting inputs to reference profiles limits its usage in a global perspective , ii) noisy profiles used for validation may be biased compared to the reference , and iii) limited control on the joint pattern of gaps and noise. Kandasamy, et al. [16 ] used an ensemble of smoothers , rather than the daily average used in [12], to create a REF within a sampled biome. This approach has advantages in comparison to [12] : i) REF is less likely to be biased to a single smoother , ii) REF can be constructed even if gaps are present in the data used to create it , and iii) actual gap profiles can be applied when generating noisy measurements . They evaluated 8 candidate methods by selecting gaps from other cloud screened time series in the same biome. H owever, the no ise magnitude of the remai ning measurements was held constant. This study proposes a nove l methodology , based on [12 , 16 ] for r ealistic noise and gap simulation for validation of satellite LSP . The approach is applied to a 20 year NOAA AVHRR NDVI times series over Canada and northern USA to quantitatively evalu ate 3 well -known LSP algorithms namely, the Asymmetric Gaussian Fitting - AGF [2], Logistic Fitting - Logistic [3, 4] and iterative Savitzky -Golay filtering - SGF [1]. 2.

390311,21349,11104,"Application of spectroscopial, hyperspectral and multispectral data to study wetlands in semi-arid environments (Central Spain)",2004,"Sensitive ecosystems such as wetlands in a semi-arid environment of Central Spain are important indicators of environmental quality and biodiversity for an area dominated by human induced activities. These areas support an important ecological function for the variety of natural plant species as well as migrating and wintering waterfowl. The wetland areas are classified as saline and sub saline due to climatic and lithological conditions. However, rapid land use changes where natural and semi-natural vegetation is substituted for intensive agricultural cultivation, over exploitation of ground water, drying and artificial drainage of wetlands as well as altering and channeling of rivers; and introducing waste disposal have severely affected the wetlands and their natural functions. The objective of this study is to determine abiotic and biotic land surface changes within semi-arid wetland and surrounding upland areas using reflective spectroscopial field, hyperspectral and multispectral data. This is carried out with intensive field work on test plots obtaining soil samples, determining vegetation types and the related spectroscopial information from a hyper saline wetland and from an anthropogenic affected floodplain including surrounding upland areas. The information obtained from the field forms the basis to identify and compare the hyperspectral (DAIS 7915) and multispectral (Landsat TM, ETM +  and ASTER) data from various sensors. Image processing is performed with the DAIS 7915 data (acquired on 29 June 2000) using a minimum noise fraction transformation followed by a pixel purity index analysis. Applying multi dimensional scatter plots, image derived end members for the different surface cover components are determined and compared with field derived end members. A pool of field and image derived end members is created and selected end members with high-resolution information are spectrally resampled to multispectral Landsat TM (17 June 1987), ETM +  (28 June 2000), and ASTER (2 June 2002) data. In order to determine and monitor the changes of selected surface cover components, an unconstrained linear spectral unmixing model is applied to the multispectral data and individual fraction maps representing the spatial distribution of the different surface covers are generated. A change detection analysis is made from the resulting end member fraction maps obtained for the different dates (1987, 2000, 2002). The results show that a detailed methodology is required in order to determine surface cover changes for wetlands in semi-arid areas. The interpretation and statistical analysis of spectroscopial field data together with soil analysis form the basis to differentiate slight compositional changes of land surface covers within the wetland and upland areas. A high correlation is shown between spectral absorption features and soil analysis representing the mineralogy of gypsum, calcite and phyllosilicates, and soil properties such as iron oxide content, electrical conductivity and soil colour. The moisture influence is naturally a dominant feature in the wetland areas and serves to distinguish the drier areas leading to the upland soils. DAIS image-derived end members determine a series of surface components, which successfully delineates the wetland areas and differentiates the areas affected by human induced activities. Synthesizing and extrapolating high-resolution information to medium-resolution data has improved the resulting fraction maps obtained for selective surface cover components related to wetland and upland areas. The surface cover changes are particularly apparent in the areas where agricultural activities are pushing back the extension of the wetland areas where soils have lower salinity levels. This approach can therefore be extrapolated to similar medium-resolution data covering thus larger regional and temporal scales"
1010197,21349,11104,Cloud detection with SVM technique,2007,"Following SPOT satellite family, PLEIADES-HR is a high resolution optical earth observation system developed by CNES and consisting in two satellites with a first launch by the end of 2009. Pleiades-HR will deliver both 70 cm Panchromatic images and 2.8 m multispectral (blue-green-red-near infrared) images with a 21km swath. As for SPOT images, Pleiades-HR ground segment includes a systematic and automatic cloud notation in order to feed the catalogue with a binary cloud mask and a confidence level notation used to monitor a manual re- notation in case of low confidence level. The cloud detection is operated from preview images generated through a fast decompression step of the low frequency wavelet subband : since Pleiades-HR compression is based upon a 3 levels wavelet transform, extracting the low frequency subband from the panchromatic and the multispectral images leads respectively to 5.6 m panchromatic and 22.4 multispectral images. In order to significantly improve the SPOT cloud notation process and get rid of frequent manual renotation, an innovative cloud detection technique has been studied and finally specified. It takes benefit from two kinds of information issued from the panchromatic and multispectral previews : multispectral reflectances and geometric parallaxes due to a panchromatic/multispectral stereoscopic angle that makes panchromatic/multispectral misregistration slightly sensitive to cloud altitudes and displacement velocity. These radiometric and geometric criteria are used as inputs of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM's are widely used for detection purposes and are based upon a training set of pixels with known criteria and classification (cloudy or cloud/free). Basically, the SVM technique aims to geometrically separate the training set represented in a R n  space, with n standing for the number of radiometric and geometric criteria taken into account for classification, using an hyperplane or some more complex surface if necessary. SVM training algorithm finds out the best frontier in order to maximize the margin, defined as a symmetric zone centered on the frontier with no training points included, and to minimize the number of wrong classification occurrences. In order to reach that goal, SVM training algorithm usually implements a Lagrangian minimization technique. Among SVM evens, one may quote the reduced complexity for the detection step : using an hyperplane to separate the two classes means that the detection process resumes to a scalar product in the R n  space for each pixel. Apart from the computation of radiometric and geometric criteria associated to each pixel to be classified, the complexity mainly lies in the training stage, executed only once for instance during the inflight commissioning period. Another advantage is the ability to generate a confidence mark for each pixel classification based upon the distance measured in the R n  space between the frontier and the point representative of the pixel to be classified : the general rule is that a large distance means a high confidence mark. The SVM technique has been implemented and assessed using a Quickbird Panchromatic/Multispectral data base, with various cloud coverages. Quickbird data are representative of future Pleiades images both in terms of resolution, spectral bands and even panchromatic/multispectral stereoscopic angle : it was thus possible to simulate quite representative panchromatic/multispectral quicklooks. The study also implied the generation of reference cloud masks that were produced through visual detection. A whole sensitivity analysis including the radiometric/geometric criteria taken into account and SVM parameters was conducted. Results were classically analyzed in terms of good detection and false alarm performances. The paper details the whole study of this SVM cloud detection technique within PLEIADES-HR framework."
1765673,21349,11104,SHARAD design and operation,2007,"This paper describes the operating principles and the design of the Mars shallow radar sounder (SHARAD), an HF sounding radar devoted to the mapping of sub-surface features of Mars and currently operational on board the NASA/JPL's Mars reconnaissance orbiter spacecraft. Compared to its predecessor MARSIS, currently operating from ESA's Mars Express, SHARAD is characterised by an higher carrier frequency (20 MHz vs a max of 5 MHz for MARSIS) and a much wider signal bandwidth (10 MHz vs 1 MHz of MARSIS). This allows SHARAD to achieve a finer range resolution (15 metres unweighted in free space) at the expenses of ground penetration, which makes the instrument ideal to probe the shallow subsurface layers (to depths of hundreds of meters) which cannot be resolved from the surface by the much far- reaching MARSIS. SHARAD uses a 85 usec chirp signal with a PRF of 700 Hz and a peak power of 10 W, and radiates by means of a 10 meters fiber foldable tube (FFT) dipole antenna, with a wide-band matching network in charge of impedance matching with the transceiver. The most challenging requirement(especially considering the large fractional bandwidth of the system) is the level of the range sidelobes, which shall be below -55 dBc after the 6th lobe, to allow proper detection of the weak subsurface echoes in presence of strong surface returns. On this side, the design takes advantage from the wide download bandwidth made available by the MRO Spacecraft to keep the on-board processing to a minimum level (basically, only a programmable coherent presuming), and leave most of the processing (range compression and synthetic aperture) on ground. In this way it is easy to use Tx chirps and Rx transfer functions characterised on- ground as reference for range correlation, with the range sidelobes limited, basically, only by the stability of the RF hardware. The limited amount of on-board processing also helped in limiting the complexity of the instrument design and, therefore, its mass and power consumption. SHARAD uses a very simple architecture, with the transmit chirp generated directly on the RF frequency (using a digital chirp generator) before being amplified to the transmit level by a class C amplifier. The receiver is even more essential, providing direct amplification of the received signal (with programmable gain and band filtering) to an A-to-D converter operated in downsampling mode by digitising the signal at 26.6 MHz rate. In this way, the complete 10 MHz signal bandwidth can be represented unambiguously with only an acceptable amount of oversampling (30%) minimising the required hardware. Instrument control and processing tasks are performed by the same AD-21020 DSP (with the help of a couple of FPGAs). The presuming can be varied from 1 to 32 in powers of two steps, and the resolution of science data can be selected to be 4, 6 or 8 bits, to allow optimisation of the data rate vs the operating scenarios. The receive window position can either be controlled in open loop, using an a priori knowledge of S/C orbit and surface topography (which demonstrated to be a very robust approach) or in closed loop."
2259090,21349,11104,Spectroscopy to characterize expansive soils,2007,"Expansive soils are major geotechnical hazards that pose several problems on engineering structures causing billions of dollars of damage in many parts of the world especially at places where there are significant climatic differences between dry and wet periods (Gourley et al., 1993; Nelson and Miller, 1992). Such soils expand or swell when moistened and shrink and crack when dried which involves tremendous volume changes. Thus, they are of significant concern in the construction sector. Identification of expansive soils and characterization of their anticipated behavior should be done exhaustively for proper site selection, design, and construction of civil engineering infrastructures. Particular attention is required especially when dealing with lightweight structures like road infrastructures, airfields, and small buildings, etc. since the uplift pressure from the soil swell exceeds the downward pressure exerted from such structures. However, the conventional standard methods of assessing the geotechnical properties of expansive soils are expensive, labor intensive and time consuming. In addition it is not possible to get continuous representation of soil masses in space. Thus, the presence and spatial distribution of these soils can be overlooked and their types might not be precisely determined. This can lead to under-sampling of sites and subsequent inadequate design specifications. Hence, there is a need to identify and characterize expansive soils in a cheaper, rapid and continuous method as compared to the conventional methods of assessing the geotechnical properties of these soils. For this study a total of 80 disturbed soil samples were collected from the eastern part of Addis Ababa city. Much construction activities are taking place in the study area and problems due to expansive soils are frequently reported. Stratified random sampling was used to obtain the required samples, and disturbed soil samples were taken from each sampling location trough hand augering and digging. We measured specific expansive soil engineering parameters namely; Atterberg limits (liquid limits, plastic limits and plasticity indices), free swell and cation exchange capacities in a soil mechanics laboratory. We also acquired the reflectance spectra of each soil sample using the ASD fieldspec spectrometer that covers the 350 nm to 2500 nm wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum to establish a relationship between the engineering parameters and the soil reflectance spectra. Analyzing the engineering parameters as well as the spectral characteristics of the soil samples has revealed that the soil samples have a large variation in their expansion potential. Statistical links were established between engineering parameters of expansive soils and absorption feature parameters at specific wavelength regions (~1400 nm, ~1900 nm and ~2200 nm). A Multivariate calibration method, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was used to construct empirical prediction models to enable the estimation of engineering parameters of expansive soils from absorption feature parameters calculated from those specific wavelength regions. Correlation coefficients (r) obtained showed that large portions of the variation in the engineering parameters could be accounted for by the spectral parameters (r = 0.85, 0.86, 0.68, 0.83 and 0.64) for CEC, LL, PL, PI and FS respectively). Apart from the high correlation coefficients, small root mean square errors of calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP), standard error of calibration (SEC) and prediction (SEP) and minimum bias were obtained indicating the potential of spectroscopy in deriving engineering parameters of expansive soils from their respective reflectance spectra, and hence its potential applicability in supporting the geotechnical investigations of such soils. Results indicate that spectroscopy can be used to identify and subsequently characterize expansive soils and their engineering behaviors that can be explained by the measured engineering parameters. This contribution of spectroscopic methods (cheaper, fast and yet capable of covering large area) at the reconnaissance stage of site investigation will assist to tailor the detailed field investigation into site-specific needs in an effort to assess the feasibility of intended projects."
1384445,21349,11104,Developing a GeoSTAR science mission,2007,"The geostationary synthetic thinned aperture radiometer (GeoSTAR) is a new instrument design that has been under development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the form of a proof-of-concept prototype. It is intended to fill a serious gap in our Earth remote sensing capabilities - namely the lack of a microwave atmospheric sounder in geostationary orbit. Such sensors have long been part of low-earth-orbiting (LEO) operational weather satellites and research satellites and have had a major impact ranging from numerical weather prediction to climate research. A similar capability in GEO is highly desired because of the advantageous observing point GEO offers, with continuous views of the entire visible Earth disc - crucial for the observation of hurricanes and other rapidly evolving atmospheric phenomena. GEO also enables full resolution of the diurnal cycle, which is particularly important in the study of atmospheric processes and climate variability where clouds and convection play a role, since those phenomena are known to have strong diurnal variability and are difficult to sample properly with sun synchronous LEO satellites. The GeoSTAR prototype produced the first interferometric radiometric images obtained at sounding frequencies in early 2005, and subsequent tests have demonstrated that the system exhibits excellent stability, accuracy and sensitivity and performs even better than predicted. This can be characterized as a breakthrough development. The technology required to implement GeoSTAR is at a level of maturity that a space mission can be contemplated. Such a mission is recommended by the U.S. National Research Council in its recent Decadal Survey of Earth missions and is being considered by both NASA and NOAA for the coming decade. Recent studies indicate that it is indeed feasible to implement a GeoSTAR mission in the 2014-16 time frame. We discuss possible mission scenarios as well as the science benefits that would ensue. The benefits are particularly significant in the area of tropical cyclones and severe storms, where there currently is a dearth of observations. With a geostationary microwave sounder it is possible to obtain the 3-dimensional distribution of temperature, water vapor and liquid water continuously and regardless of cloud cover, and atmospheric stability indices such as lifted index (LI) and convective available potential energy (CAPE) can be derived nearly everywhere. That will make it possible, for example, to detect severe-storm precursor conditions even if the area is under cloud cover. Recent progress in radiative transfer models now also makes it possible to obtain those parameters in the presence of moderate precipitation, and rain rates and snow rates can be derived as well. Aircraft based field campaign observations have also shown that a microwave sounder can be used to derive measures of convective intensity and precipitation in deep-convective systems from scattering due to ice particles formed by such systems. This can be used to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones and can be used to detect sudden intensification and weakening in near-real time."
833464,21349,11104,Sentinel-3 STM SAR ocean retracking algorithm and SAMOSA model,2015,"The SRAL Radar Altimeter, on board of the ESA Mission Sentinel-3 (S-3), has the capacity to operate either in the Pulse-Limited Mode (also known as LRM) or in the novel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode. Thanks to the initial results from SAR Altimetry obtained exploiting CryoSat-2 data, lately the interest by the scientific community in this new technology has significantly increased and consequently the definition of accurate processing methodologies (along with validation strategies) has now assumed a capital importance. In this paper, we present the algorithm proposed to retrieve from S-3 STM SAR return waveforms the standard ocean geophysical parameters (ocean topography, wave height and sigma nought) and the validation results that have been so far achieved exploiting the CryoSat-2 data as well as the simulated data. The inversion method (retracking) to extract from the return waveform the geophysical information is a curve best-fitting scheme based on the bounded Levenberg-Marquardt Least-Squares Estimation Method (LEVMAR-LSE). The S-3 STM SAR Ocean retracking algorithm adopts, as return waveform's model, the “SAMOSA” model [Ray et al, 2014], named after the R&D project SAMOSA (led by Satoc and funded by ESA), in which it has been initially developed. The SAMOSA model is a physically-based model that offers a complete description of a SAR Altimeter return waveform from ocean surface, expressed in the form of maps of reflected power in Delay-Doppler space (also known as stack) or expressed as multilooked echoes. SAMOSA is able to account for an elliptical antenna pattern, mispointing errors in roll and yaw, surface scattering pattern, non-linear ocean wave statistics and spherical Earth surface effects. In spite of its truly comprehensive character, the SAMOSA model comes with a compact analytical formulation expressed in term of Modified Bessel functions. The specifications of the retracking algorithm have been gathered in a technical document (DPM) and delivered as baseline for industrial implementation. For operational needs, thanks to the fine tuning of the fitting library parameters and the usage of look-up table for Bessel functions computation, the CPU execution time was accelerated over 100 times and made the execution in par with real time. In the course of the ESA-funded project CryoSat+ for Ocean (CP4O), new technical evolutions for the algorithm have been proposed (as usage of PTR width look up table and application of a stack masking). One of the main outcomes of the CP4O project was that, with these latest evolutions, the SAMOSA SAR retracking was giving equivalent results to CNES CPP retracking prototype, which was built with a totally different approach, which enforces the validation results. Work actually is underway to align the industrial implementation with the last new evolutions. Further, in order to test the algorithm with a dataset as realistic as possible, a set of simulated Test Data Set (generated by S-3 STM End-to-End Simulator) has been created by CLS following the specifications as described in a test data set requirements document drafted by ESA. In this work, we will show the baseline algorithm details, the evolutions, the impact of the evolutions and the results obtained processing the CryoSat-2 data and the simulated test data set."
1547007,21349,11104,Forecasting corn yield with imaging spectroscopy,2010,"Corn is the most widely produced grain in the United States with 87 million acres planted in 2009 accounting for more than 90 percent of total value and production of feed grains. Half of United States' corn production is used in livestock feed with the remainder processed into a multitude of food and industrial products including starch, sweeteners, corn oil, beverage and industrial alcohol, and fuel ethanol. With increased focus on renewable energy, an unusual link between corn and oil commodities has been created increasing the demand for the grain in ethanol production. As a result, monitoring crop performance is vital for yield forecasting and developing timely remediation strategies to optimize crop performance. Several factors including water availability, nitrogen (N) supply, soil organic mater, disease, and supply of other nutrients, have a significant impact on crop growth and grain yields. Imaging spectroscopy can provide timely, spatially explicit information for managing agricultural ecosystems. The HyspIRI mission called for by the NRC Decadal Survey [11] identifies the need for a near term space-borne hyperspectral imaging spectrometer to globally map early signs of ecosystem change through altered physiology. The primary instrument on the proposed NASA HyspIRI mission is a hyperspectral (10 nm FWHM) mapper with a 60 m ground resolution and a 19 day global revisit, which will enable imaging spectroscopy with high temporal repeat to capture the impact of environmental perturbations on ecosystem productivity. Recent advances in airborne hyperspectral imaging systems [i.e., AVIRIS [7], AISA EAGLE & Hawk (Specim, Oulu, Finland)] along with Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion satellite data have made it possible to obtain high resolution spatial and full range visible (VIS) to short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral information that can be further employed to explore vegetation productivity and change in both agricultural and surrounding ecosystems to further define algorithms and products applicable to the HyspIRI mission. From hyperspectral data, numerous statistical and spectroscopic approaches have been developed that use features in vegetation spectral curves to gain insight to biophysical parameters, including: biomass, pigments, tissue water content, and the amount of lignin, cellulose, and foliar N [1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14]. In the case of optically dense vegetation, the spectral derivative has been shown to be indicative of the abundance and activity of the absorbers in the leaves [2, 4]. Further, linear unmixing and spectral angle matching techniques take advantage of the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data and can be used alone or in conjunction with other vegetation indices for ecosystem assessment [8]. Here we will further investigate these spectroscopic techniques to enhance corn yield forecasting capabilities."
2436337,21349,11104,Dry snow extent monitoring in strong topography conditions,2005,"A new method to discriminate dry snow in alpine regions is presented. Due to the wide variety of Alpine environments, the scene under study is first segmented into surface and forested area classes from L and C-band summer polarimetric SAR data. Dry snow is then discriminated over each class using adapted methods. A new polarimetric multi- temporal optimization procedure, named PCVE, is proposed to increase the slight polarimetric contrast due to the presence of snow over surfaces. Snow covered forests are discriminated using performing polarimetric indicators resulting from a decomposition of incoherent matrix representations. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated over a French alpine test site using SIR-C L and C-band polarimetric SAR data. I. INTRODUCTION The localization of dry snow in alpine environments using intermediate frequency SAR data (L and C-bands) still remains a problematic application (1). Indeed, at such frequencies, dry snow is a low attenuation medium and only slightly affects the backscattered signal amplitude. Moreover alpine areas are characterized by a wide variety of underlying media with changing characteristics and important topography that may strongly affect a scene response. Dry snow mapping is an important product for global snow monitoring, widely used in the frame of hydrological applications, like Snow Water Equivalent determination. This paper presents a polarimetric method to map dry snow extent in alpine areas using multi-frequency and multi- temporal polarimetric SAR data. Due to the variability of alpine environments the method is decomposed into three steps. A first part is dedicated to the classification of the scene into surface and forest types from summer data sets. The classification may be applied over both L and C-band data sets. The main advantage of the C-band summer classification is the possibility to lead the dry snow discrimination analysis at a single frequency band. Each media is then processed separately. The presence of snow is then detected over surfaces by means of a new optimization method, based on a Polarimetric Contrast Variation Enhancement (PCVE) (2). Snow covered forests are analyzed from summer to winter variations of polarimetric decomposition results at C-band. Merged discrimination results are finally analyzed through a quantitative estimation of the detection performance. II. TEST SITE AND SAR DATA The test region is located in southern French alps (N 44°.15' / E 7°.15') and was measured during the SIR-C campaign in April and October 1994. Multi-temporal fully polarimetric SAR data sets were acquired at L and C-bands in both snow free (October) and snow (April) conditions. The test sites, Risoul (300 km²) and Izoard (800 km²), are composed of three main alpine environments: high altitude unvegetated surfaces, medium to high altitude forested zones and low altitude valleys (Fig. 1). Simultaneously to radar acquisitions, ground truth measurements were carried out over the test sites (automatic and manual snow sample network). They are summarized in Table I. Various types of underlying media may be encountered over the considered sites: rocks, bare soils, forests and pastures. Both test sites are partly covered by frozen spring snow, due to the early morning acquisition time. The snow cover altitude ranges from 1200 m up to 3000 m where its depth reaches 2 m. In this paper, only the Risoul site results are presented (Fig. 1)."
275352,21349,11104,Recognition and mapping of soil salinization in arid environment with hyperspectral data,2005,"Hyperspectral imagery of airborne imaging spectrometer (Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI)) was acquired over KeLaMaYi, which situated in arid region of northwestern China. In situ hyperspectral data obtained with FieldSpec® HandHeld spectrometer (ASD) simultaneously were analyzed for recognition of soil salinization. Some types of transformation were applied to the reflectance data of 60 soil samples, which preprocessed with a simple smoothing followed by band merging. A comparative study among these methods was made to ascertain their applicability for recognition accuracies. After multivariate analysis between ion concentration and reflectance data or their derivatives, a best statistical model was then extracted to predict the soil salinity and PH. Using this prediction model, subpixel classification applied to the corrected imagery helped to yield quantitative maps of soil salinity and PH. Such maps contributed to suggesting soil distribution and aggregation, estimating the spatial controls of salinization, and consequently, helping to plan soil improvement and soil conservation schemes. Detailed spectral information in the spectral range of the reflected electromagnetic solar energy (i.e., visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR)) can be acquired by recent imaging spectrometry systems. They allow the identification of a large range of land surface materials that cannot be identified with broadband, low spectral resolution satellite remote sensing systems (2). The presence of salts at the terrain surface can be detected from hyperspectral data either directly on bare soils, with salt efflorescence and crust, or indirectly through vegetation type and growth as these are controlled or affected by salinity (3). The capabilities of hyperspectral imagery for salinity mapping have been recently investigated. Reference (4) mapped saline areas characterized by salt scalds, halophytic vegetation, and soils with varying salinity degrees and types. Spectral features in the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum, related to combined water in hydrated evaporite minerals, allowed saline soils to be mapped by the HyMap scanner. Further tests showed that the subtle hydrate absorption features at 980 and 1170 nm are crucial for correct mapping of salt-affected soils. Reference (5), using the hyperspectral DAIS-7915 sensor, concluded that the Visible and Near-Infrared Analysis (VNIRA) approach is a feasible tool to produce quantitative soil surface maps of organic matter, soil field moisture and soil salinity. The objective of our study, based on multivariate statistical analysis of field-derived hyperspectral spectral data of soil samples and hyperspectral imagery mapping, was to investigate the potential of high resolution reflectance spectra to access soil salinization level and spatial distribution in an inland arid environment of northwestern China. In this paper, we describe the spectral capability in the 400 to 900nm range of spectra of selected soils in KeLaMaYi. These are used to develop a strategy for the use of field-derived spectra for the mapping of salinized soil from Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI) airborne scanner imagery."
2032640,21349,11104,Field Surveys for Biomass Assessment in African Savanna Woodlands,2008,"Most rural and some low-income urban households in southern Africa rely on fuelwood and charcoal to meet their domestic energy demands, targeting specific tree species for their calorific value. The lack of quantitative data on extractable standing woody biomass makes it difficult for energy planners to ascertain the sustainability of exploiting such resources. Large scale estimation of biomass using ground-based methods is both tedious and time-consuming. Optical remote sensing techniques are constrained by adverse atmospheric conditions such as clouds and haze, and in any case survey only the upper surface of the vegetation canopy. Recent advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technologies coupled with geographic information systems (GIS) offer innovative ways to quantify and assess available woody biomass. Tree species heterogeneity in savanna woodlands requires training data with minimal target-to-image noise to distinguish tree vegetation on SAR imagery. The absolute positioning of trees is critical for correlating ground survey measurements with the corresponding aerial photography or satellite positions. The ground truth data is useful for calibrating and validating radar satellite imagery in biomass assessment surveys. GPS offers rapid methods of establishing both control and capturing field data. While Differential-GPS gives highly accurate ground positions, Electronic Distance Meter (EDM) surveying techniques are used to compliment GPS measurements when field conditions are not favourable. GPS accuracy is degraded when receivers are operated under dense tree canopies. Connecting field surveys to national mapping systems or GPS networks allows easy integration of woodland spatial information with data from other sectors. This is constrained by the lack of common reference frameworks. In Africa, a unified African Reference Framework (AFREF) is still in its formative stages and network GPS is not yet fully developed. South Africa is the probably the only country that has a well developed GPS infrastructure. Although commercial GPS base stations are available, the required initial capital investment and annual maintenance charges often limit their use in developing countries. This paper proposes a method which combines rapid static DGPS, EDM topographic surveying and mobile GIS techniques to capture, compute and record absolute positions and vegetation parameters of preferred fuelwood tree species in African savanna woodlands. The proposed method will generate ground-truth data for preferred fuelwood species in selected case study villages under the VW Foundation Biofuels Modeling project, covering Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa."

It forms the continuation of JAXA's on-going JERS-1 SAR Global Rain Forest and Global Boreal Forest Mapping project(GRFM/GBFM) into the era of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS). The ALOS K & C Initiative has been set up to support the data and information needs required by international environmental Conventions; Carbon Cycle scientists and Environmental Conservation programs (referred below to as the CCCs). Led and coordinated by EORC JAXA, the Initiative is being undertaken by an international Science Team and focuses primarily on defining and optimizing the provision of data products and validated thematic information derived from in-situ and satellite sensors focusing on data acquired from the Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). The objective of the ALOS K & C Initiative is to define, develop and validate thematic products derived from ALOS PALSAR data that can be used to meet specific information requirements relating to the CCCs. A key component of this work has been the development of a systematic data acquisition strategy for ALOS which comprises fixed, systematic global observation plans for PALSAR. The strategy is implemented as a top-level foreground mission and with a priority level second only to that of emergency observations. With emphasis on acquiring repetitive and consistent data over continental scales, it ensures that adequate data will be collected to allow the required thematic output products to be developed on a timely basis. The K & C Initiative is based on the three coordinated themes relating to global biomes; Forests, Wetlands, Deserts and Semi-Arid Regions, and a fourth theme dealing with the generation of regional ALOS PALSAR Mosaics. A key word for the Initiative is regional- scale applications and product development, with data requirements in the order of hundreds or thousands of PALSAR scenes for each prototype area. Each theme has identified key products that can be generated from the PALSAR data including land cover, forest change mapping and forest biomass and structure analysis; global wetland inventory compilation and landscape change determination; and freshwater resources and desertification. Each of the products developed will be generated using a combination of PALSAR imagery, in situ measurements and ancillary datasets.An international Scientific Advisory Panel has been established to maintain the scientific relevance of project design and to ensure alignment with other relevant international efforts (e.g. GOFC/GOLD, IGOL, GTOS/TCO). The panel consists of scientists active in the fields of carbon modeling and biophysical parameter retrieval; SAR and image processing, as well as and representatives from GOFC, TCO, FAO, space agencies, universities and public research institutions."
2521548,21349,11104,ALBEDOMAP: MERIS land surface albedo retrieval using data fusion with MODIS BRDF and its validation using contemporaneous EO and in situ data products,2007,"A representative albedo is required by ESA for the improved retrieval of atmospheric products, such as water vapour, from the ENVISAT-MERIS instrument. This albedo is required at 13 of the 15 spectral channels of MERIS. An algorithm is described which has been applied to the generation of a global albedo for these 13 spectral bands of MERIS over 16-day time periods at a resolution of 0.05deg for the time period from June 2002 to December 2006. Inputs to this algorithm include improved cloud and snow detection, aerosol correction using the MERIS data itself and derived Spectral surface Directional Reflectances, SDRs (Schroder et ah, Preusker et al, see, http://envisat.esa. int/workshops/meris_aatsr2005/). Owing to the lack of sufficient directional samples for most of the Earth's land surface, even for a monthly compositing time period, direct inversion of BRDF parameters for MERIS are not possible worldwide. Instead the 16-day Collection 4 MODIS BRDFs at 0.05deg resolution (derived using either full inversions or magnitude inversions from the MOD43 values) were employed in a magnitude inversion scheme for the 4 common MERIS (490plusmn5 [b3], 560plusmn5 [b5], 665plusmn5 [b7], 865plusmn10 [bl3]) bands with MODIS (459-479 {b3}, 545-565 {b4}, 620-670 {bl}, 841-8766 {b2}). The impact of applying Terra-only compared to Terra+Aqua-combined are here compared and presented. In keeping with previously reported results, there are larger numbers of full MODIS inversions (and consequently better MERIS albedos) for the combined BRDF but the total number of MODIS BRDF retrievals remains stubbornly similar. Spectral interpolation to the remaining 9 MERIS bands and to 3 broadband regions (0.4-0.7 mum, 0.7-3 mum, 0.4-3 mum) is then performed using polynomial look-up tables derived by Dr Shunlin Liang (University of Maryland). As spectral albedo data is required on monthly time-steps for most applications, a simple- minded weighting function based on the fractional time-period of each 16-day time period within a month was adopted for creating monthly products from 16-day products at 10km and 0.1deg. Global products on a 16-day time-step are being generated for the whole time period using both Terra-only and, where available, Terra+Aqua-combined Collection 4 MODlS-BRDFs. These EO products have been compared against contemporaneous MODIS spectral albedos (over 16-days) which have been gap-filled (Moody et al., 2005) as well as Collection 5 products, where available. Satellite intercomparisons have also been performed for monthly products of the monthly MERIS spectral albedo products for common bands against M1SR level-3 and POLDER level-3 products as well as for a subset of M1SR level-2 instantaneous products and the results will be shown here. Finally, inter-comparisons are shown of these EO products against ground-based albedometer measurements for a site in Finland will be presented as representative of one of several worldwide sites available through the CA VE taking into account, where necessary, issues associated with land cover heterogeneity."
2462824,21349,11104,Numerical studies of polarized light reflection from wind roughed liquid surfaces,2008,"Satellite remote measurements taken over the ocean surface, often contain information of near-surface or sub-surface processes, which occur on, or over the ocean. These remote measurements, can enable as to retrieve important parameters such as near surface wind, sea surface temperature and salinity and underwater bathymetry, which, all, in one way or another, depend on how well we understand sea surface reflection and roughness. However, the quality of these retrievals are often limited by the amount of scattering, emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation caused by atmospheric aerosols which often shows dependency on polarization. From a remote sensing perspective, it is very well known that at off-nadir incidence angles and wavelenghts longer than 3.6 mum, the radiance originated from the sea surface becomes partially vertically polarized. Similarly, at shorter wavelenghts (shorter than 3.6 mum), the total radiance at off-nadir angles can become strongly horizontally polarized , . Since at shorter wavelengths, the reflected skylight becomes more significant; it is important to quantify the contribution that atmospheric polarization has on the top of the atmosphere remotely observed sea surface reflection, specially near areas of enhanced surface reflection such as from the Sun glitter. Furthermore, surface phenomena, such as wind-generated waves, gravity and capillary waves, internal waves, surface currents, density fluctuations etc., modulate the ocean's surface roughness which has a direct effect on sea surface reflection. This modulating effect is represented by the so called the mean square slope (MSS) of ocean surface waves. In general, the MSS is mainly related to short wind waves which are strongly dependent on wind speed, wind direction, surface waves and air sea temperature. To understand these wind and wave related effects on the Sun glint pattern, Salinas [3] have developed an atmospheric radiative transfer model that incorporates a new wind-wave description for the mean square slope of the sea surface. This model solves the scalar radiative transfer equation and includes wind interaction and wave states, such as wave age, as the main factors contributing to surface roughness. In this paper, we extend the above mentioned work and include light polarization effects originating from aerosol and molecular scattering and from the roughness of the surface. Polarization is considered by using the 4-Stokes vector formalism and the 4x4 scattering phase matrix for aerosols and molecules. Simulation results showing polarization effects on the simulated, top of the atmosphere, Sun glint pattern are presented. Initial simulations performed at low wind speed show increasing levels of linear polarization with increasing values for the wave age parameter. However, at higher wind speed, lower levels of linear polarization is obtained for similar values of the wave age parameter. On the other hand, calculations performed at near surface levels, show low linear polarization and a gradual shift of the Brewster angle with increasing wind speed and wave age. These results, although initial, will be carefully analyzed and compared with limiting cases where available. Finally, the present model can have possible applications to the retrieval of wind and wave states, such as wave age, near a Sun glint region and for the study of of ocean surface roughness characteristics arising from air-sea interaction."

INTRODUCTION The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) has successfully operated for more than two years since its launch on -board the Suomi -National Polar -orbiting Partnership (S -NPP) spacecraft. The VIIRS has 22 spectral bands: 16 moderate resolutio n bands (M1 -M16 ; 750 m at nadir ) that are primarily used for radiometric observations, 5 imagery bands (I1 -I5 ; 375 m at nadir), and 1 day/night band (DNB) of 750 m nadir resolution . M1 -M11, I1 -I3, and DNB are the reflective solar bands (RSB) covering wavel engths from 0.41 to 2.3 P m. M12 -M16 and I4 -I5 are the thermal emissive bands (TEB) covering wavelengths from 3.7 to 12 P m. 7 of the 22 spectral bands; M1 -M5, M7, and M13 are the dual gain bands, enabling observations to be made over a large dynamic range. VIIRS on -orbit calibration is provided by a set of on -board calibrators (OBC) designed with a strong MODIS heritage , which include a solar diffuser (SD), a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), and a blackbody (BB) as shown in Figure 1. Since launch, th e NASA VIIRS Characterization Support Team (VCST), in support of the S -NPP mission operation team (MOT), has scheduled and carried out a broad range of VIIRS radiometric and geometric calibration activities, which have led to the generation of consistent c alibrat ion look -up tables (LUT) for improved Sensor Data Records (SDR) production.

INTRODUCTION Remote sensing of the extent and distribution of individual crop types has proven useful to a wide range of end-users, including governments, farmers, and scientists (Qi-Jing Liu et al,2005). Maps of cropland distributions are usually generated by supervised classification of multiple Landsat images throughout the growing season. These approaches require amounts of manual interpretation and cloud-free high spatial resolution imagery that are prohibitive for operational implementation over large areas and in multiple years (David B. Lobell,2004). The NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS, including the daily global coverage, moderate spatial resolution (0.25 to 1 km), has rapid availability of various products, and cost-free status may allow for operational mapping of croplands. However, the large size of even the 250-m MODIS data relative to most fields results in MODIS pixels containing mixtures of different fields, crop types, and non-crop surfaces. As a result, approaches that assign a single hard classification to each pixel may be prone to significant errors when mapping crop types ( Fisher, 1997). If the pure spectral pixels of different crops can be gained in finer resolution, a big problem will be solved for mixture pixel unmixing and scaling reversion in quantitative remote sensing application by coarser resolution satellite , for example Landsat TM to Terra MODIS sensor. Maize is one of the most important crops in China. During maize growth with rain season of May to September month every year in North China Plain, it is low available for Landsat TM images. During maize growth of June to September, 2003, there is only a scene of TM image captured while the maize spectrum experiment of ground all-growth period is performing. It is necessary to research the maize spectrum characteristic of each month all over the growth period. Another, the every-day gained MODIS image is becoming an important data source of crop monitoring. The ground orchard, greensward and woodland (using in virescence of urban and road) usually disturb the maize classification by TM image. Therefore, it is of great meaning to extract pure maize pixels for improving the classification of the pure maize pixel recognition for maize condition monitoring and yield estimation by scaling method. In this study, we investigated the impact of greensward"
2092300,21349,11104,Building Good Spectral Vegetation Backgrounds in the VNIR,2008,"It has been said that one person's signal is another person's noise, or alternatively, one engineer's ground clutter is another engineer's object of interest. Vegetation observed with spectral imagers can be regarded either way. Some users of spectral data (multispectral or hyperspectral) want to study the plants in the pixels, and others want to use characteristics of the plants to move them out of the way of more interesting things. This is a difficult problem in either case in that vegetation is not time-static (spectral reflectance changes with seasons) and vegetation in general has smaller spatial scale than spectral data sets do. One approach is to model the reflectance or other properties of plants at pixel scale, using various observed data and mathematical models to span both wavelength and spatial dimension. Data collection at the leaf/branch level is known to be costly in labor, travel, and equipment and fraught with pitfalls for the field operator. Models for scaling up from plant data to larger spatial dimensions also have assumptions and built-in limitations. One big problem is to identify and avoid sources of error and variance which can cause a collection's data to be suspect. Remotely-sensed spectral data have been around for decades, and research on uses of these data continues even as commercial and government agencies use multispectral and hyperspectral sets to identify species cover in forests, monitor the health of crops, seek mineral deposits, track pollution, and monitor the condition of roadways. Those who use spectral images get the data from sources like LANDSAT, ASTER, and SPOT, or newer systems such as AVIRIS, MODIS, and HYPERION. The technical challenge is to aggregate, upward, the knowledge collected at the leaf level, to enable people to make inferences at the pixel level. I will discuss some of these published efforts in more detail. There are several issues at each level in this aggregation, including calibration, drift, illumination, and sample integrity. In measuring leaf reflectance, there are several protocols dependent on the measuring equipment. The instrument also needs to be calibrated and controlled for drift. Deterioration of the sample being measured will occur. Illumination, if solar, will vary as measurements proceed. The same issues occur in the greenhouse/laboratory setting. We will explore several of these sources of non- representative spectra. Researchers are attempting to bridge the gap from leaf to pixel using canopy reflectance models. A few widely accepted models are SAILH and PROSPECT, and their variants. (Canopy models are also used for estimating biometric properties over large areas)."
2481007,21349,11104,Application of KLIMA/G-POD algorithm to CO 2 retrieval from IASI/METOP-A observations and comparison with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS products,2012,"The ESA research project “Application of KLIMA algorithm to CO 2  retrieval from IASI/METOP-A observations and comparison with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS products” aims at the develop of a dedicated software, based on the KLIMA inversion algorithm (originally proposed by IFAC-CNR for the ESA Earth Explorer Mission), optimally suited for CO 2  retrieval and integrated into the ESA GRID-based operational environment G-POD (Grid Processing On-Demand) to processing Level-1 data acquired by the IASI instrument onboard the METOP-A satellite and to perform a comparison and cross-validation of GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level-2 data. Optimized versions of the KLIMA-IASI code have been investigated, aiming at developing a non-operation retrieval code with capabilities that meet the requirements of cross validation with GOSAT TANSO-FTS products and with adequate features for the integration on the G-POD system. The KLIMA algorithm consists of two distinct modules: the Forward Model and the Retrieval Model, optimized for inverse processing of IASI measurements. The Forward Model is a line-by-line radiative transfer model, with capability to simulate wideband spectral radiances acquired by IASI. The adopted spectroscopic database is HITRAN 2008. Dedicated spectroscopic database and line shape are implemented for CO 2 , to take into account the line-mixing effect (Niro et al., 2005). The Retrieval Model uses a constrained Nonlinear Least Square Fit approach and the cost function to be minimized takes into account the a priori information (Optimal Estimation Method) and the Marquardt parameter. To reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties, this module implements a multi-target retrieval (more than one species is simultaneously retrieved) and a complete variance-covariance matrix (VCM), including both the measurement errors and the errors in the estimate of FM parameters. For the performance of the retrieval a target accuracy of 0.3% (1 ppmv out of 370 ppmv) on regional scales (1000 × 1000 km) at monthly intervals, which is consistent with the requirements of the GOSAT mission for CO 2  products, was assumed as reference value. The required maximum program size was set to one Gbyte and the running time was limited with the aim of processing one orbit of IASI data in one day when using G-POD computing resources. The KLIMA-IASI ARM algorithm has been successfully integrated in the ESA G-POD for Earth Observation Application and now the code is available to all interested users for bulk processing of IASI data. ESA G-POD is a GRID based-operational environment, accessible using a dedicated Web portal (http://gpod.eo.esa.int/). It hosts more than 350 local computing nodes, more than 500 TB of EO data coming from ESA and non-ESA satellites. The full capacity of G-POD computing resources, that can be made available for KLIMA-IASI bulk processing, are currently under evaluation; moreover the upload of the full set of IASI data acquired in one year (march 2010 - march 2011) shall be completed (3 months are available at the moment). After the procurement of a consolidated version of the KLIMA-IASI/G- POD retrieval code it was possible to start the processing of IASI spectra and for comparison and cross-validation of KLIMA-IASI CO 2  products with GOSAT/TANSO-FTS operational products. Using the KLIMA inversion code integrated into the ESA G-POD, it was possible to perform an extensive inter-comparison and cross-validation of a selected set of IASI measurements collocated with GOSAT TANSO-FTS observations. The KLIMA-IASI code was used for the retrieval of CO 2  total column from a series of test cases for comparison with GOSAT TANSO-FTS SWIR L2 data. Retrieved values from measurements acquired by the two instruments in February 2011 in two selected areas between 25–45°N over Nord America and Asia are shown in figures 1–2, along with maps of the footprints of IASI (red crosses) and GOSAT (green crosses) Field of Views."
2094792,21349,11104,Coherent processing of long series of SAR images,2005,"In the past years, PS analysis has shown its ca- pability to treat simultaneously long series of SAR data. In this contribution an attempt is made to overcome some of the limitations of the said technique, namely its negligence of decorrelation phenomena; a maximum likelihood estimator for the physical parameters of interest is described and some results are presented. I. INTRODUCTION During the past decade the availability of long series of coherent SAR images led to the development of multiple- image processing techniques. The advantages of such joint analyses over convetional DInSAR are an increased capability in distinguishing the various contributions to the interferomet- ric phase and consequently a better estimate of atmospheric delay variations, one of the most severe limitations to accurate ground deformation recovery. We refer in particular to the PS technique (1), which has proven very effective in identifying stable scatterers, with respect to their phase properties, expecially over urbanized areas. The PS technique, in its stricter version, requires the target to possess some well defined geometrical and temporal characteristics: its cross-range extension must be limited and its reflectivity should not change over the entire data set time span. When these requirements are not met by the radar target, the estimates of physical parameters on it are considered unreliable and the point discarded. Different ways to overcome this limitation have already been proposed. With respect to temporal decorrelation we recall for instance the Semi-PS/Temporary-PS concept (2), tackling the case in which a target appears or disappears at some point in the amplitude time series (e.g. when a new building is contructed). Moreover, it is common practice to discard images because of their time isolation or because they represent areas temporary covered by snow (such as winter images in the Alps), since they have no or little chance to be coherent with the main bunch of the data set. With respect to geometric decorrelation we recall the SBAS technique which carries out the analysis only on small baseline subsets (3) and the so called higher order interferometry (4) which models the presence of two dominant scatterers in the resolution cell (with different cross-range positions). In this paper we present a new attempt of overcoming the above mentioned limitations of standard PS interferometry. The goal is to complete successful estimations of the param- eters of interest on a larger number of points. In Section II the expression of a Maximum Likelihood estimator is derived from a statistical characterization of SAR observables and real data results are presented. Eventually, some considerations are made on the underlying mechanisms of the proposed estimator and on its proximity to standard PS analysis."

The Galathea 3 ship expedition circumnavigated the globe starting from Denmark 11 August 2006, visiting Greenland, Azores, South Africa, Australia, Solomon Islands, New Zealand, Antarctica, Chile, Galapagos, the Caribbean, the Northeastern USA and finishing in Denmark 25 April 2007. During the entire expedition satellite images were ordered along the ship track, downloaded, processed, archived and used for education. The satellite images are displayed in Google Earth along with 10 minute observations of air and sea parameters observed at the ship (http://galathea.oersted.dtu.dk). This material forms basis for 9 running projects along the entire route and 24 site-specific cases. Observations from several science projects onboard will be used in the site-specific cases. One of the continuous study cases is chlorophyll observed from Envisat MERIS. As an example: in the upwelling zone near Namibia a very high level of chlorophyll was observed from MERIS. The ship route consequently was changed slightly the day after in order to traverse the area with the highest amount of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll observed onboard (in-situ) two days later show high amounts. In addition, in the science project on the carbon cycle a significant emission of CO 2  was observed. The students can use the data online in the classroom. Students from several classes were onboard for part of the expedition and these classes in particular used the Satellite Eye teaching material. In Google Earth satellite images of many themes are shown. These include sea ice, sea surface temperature, ocean wind, wave height, sea surface level, ozone, clouds and radar images of ocean and land. Also high spatial resolution land cover mapping of the visited harbors and their surroundings are included. The case studies uses the image processing software LEO Works developed through the ESA project EDUSPACE, the European Earth Observation web site for Secondary Schools (http://www.eduspace.esa.int). For each theme a thorough educational material has been developed in Danish and English. ESA has granted a large amount of Envisat as well as PROBA images and third mission data from SPOT and Landsat. Also data from NOAA, NASA, JAXA and QUICKBIRD were used."
551495,21349,11104,The TerraSAR-L mission and system,2004,"The TerraSAR-L system, currently in Phase B definition carried out by a European/Canadian consortium lead by EADS Astrium Ltd., provides ESA with its most powerful radar imaging programme to date. Key mission characteristics are a 5-year mission lifetime, global coverage from a 14-day repeat 635-km orbit, more than 20 minutes per orbit of SAR data acquisition in L-band, in both right-looking (nominal) and left-looking configurations, and a launch in late 2008. TerraSAR-L first mission priority is serving commercial applications focused on agriculture, forestry and marine applications. Joint products from TerraSAR-L and the German national programme TerraSAR-X use the complementary properties of the backscattering in L and X bands for high levels of classification performance necessary for crop monitoring, forest inventory and cartographic maps of different thematic content and scale. Scientific and institutional applications are defined focused on solid Earth monitoring relying on differential interferometry. L-band penetration of vegetation cover facilitates these applications also over vegetated surfaces. The high coherence of L-band assists the monitoring of ice sheet and glacier dynamics. Sea ice classification is supported with full polarimetric measurements. Large-scale land cover change detection, global forest biomass estimation, permafrost monitoring, wetland inventory, soil moisture retrieval and flood monitoring are also supported. A dedicated Wave Mode provides measurements of directional ocean surface wave spectra. Additionally for single-pass interferometry and generation of a global DEM, a complementary cartwheel system with different micro satellite constellations flying in close formation with TerraSAR-L has been investigated. The spacecraft is built around an active phased array antenna and provides full polarimetric capabilities, maximum bandwidth within the 85 MHz allocation for Earth observation in L-band, and repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry. The platform is based on a novel Snapdragon configuration. The TerraSAR-L Ground Segment provides the operational link between the spacecraft, the TerraSAR Exploitation and Service Infrastructure and the users. A high-performance modular architecture is designed to fulfil the high requirements on throughput, quality and accessibility of data, as well as the reuse of existing infrastructure elements and the interoperability with other missions, especially with the companion TerraSAR-X Ground Segment"

One of the objectives of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2004 (SMEX04) was to address some aspects of this problem, specifically variability introduced by topography and convective precipitation. Other goals included understanding the role of the land surface in the North American Monsoon System. Data were collected during the month of August 2004 at three scales; ground based point measurements, aircraft passive microwave mapping, and satellite observations using AMSR-E and other sensors. SMEX04 was conducted over two regions: Arizona - semi-arid climate with sparse vegetation and moderate topography, and Sonora (Mexico) - moderate vegetation with strong topographic gradients. The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR/CX) was flown on a Naval Research Lab P- 3B aircraft as part of SMEX04 (11 dates of coverage over Arizona and 10 over Sonora). General meteorological conditions, the PSR/CX data sets and selected comparisons of this data to AMSR-E are presented. Field experiments in support of remote sensing, hydrology and climate have included catchments throughout North America. These experiments have been intensive efforts ranging from one to six weeks in duration. The basic approach used in these experiments has been to collect ground-based samples of soil moisture in conjunction with aircraft flights at the same time as satellite overpasses. The aircraft instruments operate in low frequency microwave wavebands that are well suited for the measurement of soil moisture. The aims of these experiments have been: validation of remotely sensed data from aircraft and/or space-borne microwave sensors, the mapping of spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, the relationship of soil moisture to vegetation and the near-surface atmospheric characteristics, and the collection of in-situ gravimetric data for soil moisture for validation of the land surface hydrological models used to simulate the watershed at pre- specified spatial and temporal resolutions. SMEX04 builds on preceding experiments by focusing specifically on topography, vegetation and strengthening the soil moisture components of the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) (http://www.joss.ucar.edu/name). One of the main objectives of NAME is to improve prediction of warm season precipitation. Warm season precipitation is highly dependent on convection, which, in turn, is controlled, at least in part, by soil moisture and surface temperature. Therefore, an accurate characterization of spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture is critical to NAME. This paper focuses on preliminary results from the SMEX04 aircraft campaign involving the PSR/CX and relationships between the aircraft and satellite observations. Additional details on SMEX04 can be found at http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/smex04."
2469910,21349,11104,Evaluation of a soil moisture data assimilation system over West Africa,2009,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) is responsible for providing monthly global crop estimates that heavily influence global commodity market access. These estimates are derived from a merging of many data sources including satellite and ground observations, and more than 20 years of climatology and crop behavior data over key agricultural areas. The goal of IPAD is to provide timely and accurate estimates of global crop conditions for use in up-to-date commodity intelligence reports. A crucial requirement of these global crop yield forecasts is the regional characterization of surface and sub-surface soil moisture. However, due to the spatial heterogeneity and dynamic nature of precipitation events and soil wetness, accurate estimation of regional land surface-atmosphere interactions based sparse ground measurements is difficult [1]. Temporal resolution is particularly important for predicting adequate surface wetting and drying between precipitation events and is closely integrated with CADRE. We attempt to improve upon the existing system by applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA soil moisture model. The improved temporal resolution and spatial coverage of the satellite-based EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) is envisaged to provide a better characterization of root zone soil moisture at the regional scale and enable more accurate crop monitoring in key agricultural areas This work aims at evaluating the utility of merging satellite-retrieved soil moisture estimates with the IPAD two-layer soil moisture model used within the DBMS. We present a quantitative analysis of the assimilated soil moisture product over West Africa (9°N-20°N; 20°W-20°E). This region contains many key agricultural areas and has a high agro-meteorological gradient from desert and semi-arid vegetation in the North, to grassland, trees and crops in the South, thus providing an ideal location for evaluating the assimilated soil moisture product over multiple land cover types and conditions. A data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely-sensed soil moisture by comparing assimilated soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products."
635214,21349,11104,Very high resolution sar images over dense urban area,2005,"The ONERA RAMSES system is a flexible SAR system in constant evolution developed mainly as a test bench for new technologies and to provide specific data for target detection, recognition and identification (TDRI) algorithm evaluation. It is flown on a Transall C160, a twin engine transport aircraft, operated by the French test-flight centre (CEV). This paper gives an overview of the system, lists the latest upgrading (electronic and SAR processor) and presents recent acquisition campaign over an urban area in very high (around 10 cm) resolution mode and the first analysis of these SAR images. I. SYSTEM OVERVIEW The ONERA RAMSES system is an experimental synthetic aperture radar system designed for signal acquisition and recording under a wide spectrum of modes and frequencies. Signal processing and image synthesis is done off-line allowing for a large flexibility in the waveforms and operating modes (no processing hardware constraints). At present, available frequency bands range from 400 MHz (P-band) up to 95 GHz (W-band). Full polarimetric (switched transmit) modes are available in P, L, C and X bands. High resolution (10cm) in X, Ka and soon Ku bands. Along-track interferometry have been demonstrated in P- band (2 channels), L-band (3 channels), X-band (4 channels). Across-track (with passive or alternatively transmitting channels) is available in X and Ka bands. Simultaneous acquisitions (such as dual frequency bands) are possible (up to 4 to 8 channel × 2 alternating recording, depending on data rates) Signal can be recorded as ramp demodulated, frequency shifted and even direct digitising in the lower bands This impressive choice of operation mode is the consequence of the modular design of the system, in which high frequency front-ends are made for each frequency band, and a common signal generator, intermediate frequency and digitising/recording back-end is used. Antennae are stacked and positioned at an open side door of the aircraft after take-off, and pulled back before landing. Trajectory acquisition involves an inertial navigation unit (INU) used for quicklook synthesis and system guidance and a differential GPS hybridized inertial measurement unit (IMU)used for off-line post-processing of the final trajectory for image synthesis. Along with the GPS ground reference station, the ground team also deploys calibrating targets (corner reflectors, dihedrals, transponders or Luenberg lenses)."

The streamflow in this study region decrease sharply since the mid- 1980s. The streamflow shows least cycle of 5-10 years by analyzing the streamflow data in 40 years of three gauging stations (Maduo, Jimai and Tangnaihai) based on the plural Morlet wavelet analysis. The meteorological and streamflow data from 1986 to 2000 were separated into three periods, to obtain the 5 years' average data, and then the trend and cycle of the change are analyzed. The streamflow of the three stations in three periods decrease sharply compare to the average streamflow in the past 40 years, and the decreasing velocity of streamflow was increasing in recent years; especially in the Maduo gauging station, the average streamflow decrease 80% compare to the averaging streamflow in the past 40 year; the velocity of streamflow decrease from September to March in the next year is bigger than that from April to August. But the precipitation do not decrease in the three periods of three station; the daily minimum temperature increase 0.5deg, the daily maximum temperature also increase with less range; the change of surface water evaporation is irregular, which increase in the first two periods and decreased in the last period in Maduo station, while the Jimai station has opposite situation. Based on filed investigation and comparison of two periods of remote sensing data obtained in 1986 and 2000, from spatial distribution pattern variations and type transformation trend, the spatial changes and evolution pattern of land ecosystem in the eco-environment source regions of the Yellow river were analyzed using the analytical method of landscape ecological spatial pattern, the environment changed acutely. The high coveralpine cold steppe, medical cover alpine clod steppe, high cover alpine cold meadow, medial cover alpine cold meadow, swamp meadow, alpine cold swamp meadow decrease 19.35%, 24.96%, 3.32%, 9.82%, 13.08%, 40.82%, respectively; river, lake and glacier decrease 11.35%, 4.90%, 29.26%, respectively; low cover alpine cold steppe, low cover alpine cold meadow and desertification land increase 36.27 % , 3.25 % , 10.86 % , respectively. The SWAT (soil and water assessment tools) model is employed in this study, the meteorological data were obtained through Gradient plus Inverse-Distance-Squared (GIDS) based on the 23 weather stations in or near the study area in recent 15 years, vegetation types were derived based on the two periods of remote sensing data, the required soil parameter is obtained from the soil classification and soil texture database at the scale of 1:1,000,000. The streamflow which simulated by the SWAT model match the observed data quite well, the Nash parameter of monthly and yearly modeled streamflow in the periods of calibration and validation all exceed 0.8.

2521543,21349,11104,Techniques and examples for the 3D reconstruction of complex scattering situations using TerraSAR-X,2009,"The German radar satellite TerraSAR-X was launched in June 2007. Since then, it is continuously providing high resolution space-borne radar data which are perfectly suitable for sophisticated interferometric applications. I.e. the mission concept and the SAR sensor support the coherent stacking of radar scenes which is the basis for advanced processing techniques e.g. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and SAR tomography. In particular, the short repeat cycle of eleven days and the highly reproducible scene repetition of the spotlight acquisitions support the stacking and consequently the time series analysis of the radar data. Furthermore, the sensor's orbital tube is precisely controlled to be in the order of 200 m which basically allows to utilize the baseline spread of the stacked acquisitions. However, this small spread is actually limiting the resolution in the SAR tomography. Interferometric applications could be demonstrated already in a very early stage of the TerraSAR-X mission. Because the resolution is 0.6 m in slant range and 1.1 m in azimuth in the high resolution spotlight mode the PSI and the SAR tomography processing results were impressive. Urban areas and single buildings could be mapped from space in three dimensions. Even the structural stress of single buildings caused by thermal dilation could be demonstrated. However, extended layover areas are caused by typical buildings and as a consequence complicated scattering situations need to be resolved. DLR's operational In-SAR processing system GENESIS had already been adapted to cope with the new sensor modes of TerraSAR-X and their new specific spectral characteristics. Now, the new image characteristics e.g. the extended layover areas and the long time coherent distributed scatterer need better to be supported. Subject is to optimally exploit the available information e.g. the radar reflectivity. Several algorithms of the processing system can take advantage of this, e.g. the scatterer configuration detection. As a matter of fact, the scatterer configuration has now become a very important characteristic for each resolution cell. It influences e.g. the estimation data extraction, the estimation of the 3D location and basically the estimation precision. A typical resolution cell can be composed of a single dominant point scatterer surrounded by clutter, two or more dominant point scatterers in clutter and of distributed scatterers with a specific phase stability over time. The paper provides technical details and a processing example of a newly developed algorithm to retrieve the 3D location of point scatterers from the scene's intensity which finally also provides the information on the scatterer configuration in a resolution cell."
1826827,21349,11104,Temporal air quality monitoring using surveillance camera,2007,"Various studies showed that inhaled fine particles with diameter less than 10 micrometers (PM10) in the air can cause adverse health effects on human, such as heart disease, asthma, stroke, bronchitis and the like. This is due to their ability to penetrate further into the lung and alveoli. The aim of this study is to develop a state-of-art reliable technique to use surveillance camera for monitoring the temporal patterns of PM10 concentration in the air. Once the air quality reaches the alert thresholds, it will provide warning alarm to alert human to prevent from long exposure to these fine particles. This is important for human to avoid the above mentioned adverse health effects. In this study, an internet protocol (IP) network camera was used as an air quality monitoring sensor. It is a 0.3 mega pixel charge-couple-device (CCD) camera integrates with the associate electronics for digitization and compression of images. This network camera was installed on the rooftop of the school of physics. The camera observed a nearby hill, which was used as a reference target. At the same time, this network camera was connected to network via a cat 5 cable or wireless to the router and modem, which allowed image data transfer over the standard computer networks (Ethernet networks), internet, or even wireless technology. Then images were stored in a server, which could be accessed locally or remotely for computing the air quality information with a newly developed algorithm. The results were compared with the alert thresholds. If the air quality reaches the alert threshold, alarm will be triggered to inform us this situation. The newly developed algorithm was based on the relationship between the atmospheric reflectance and the corresponding measured air quality of PM10 concentration. In situ PM10 air quality values were measured with DustTrak meter and the sun radiation was measured simultaneously with a spectroradiometer. Regression method was use to calibrate this algorithm. Still images captured by this camera were separated into three bands namely red, green and blue (RGB), and then digital numbers (DN) were determined. These DN were used to determine the atmospherics reflectance values of difference bands, and then used these values in the newly developed algorithm to determine PM10 concentration. The results of this study showed that the proposed algorithm produced a high correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.7567 and low root-mean-square error (RMS) of plusmn 5 mu g/m 3  between the measured and estimated PM10 concentration. A program was written by using microsoft visual basic 6.0 to download the still images automatically from the camera via the internet and utilize the newly developed algorithm to determine PM10 concentration automatically and continuously. This concluded that surveillance camera can be used for temporal PM10 concentration monitoring. It is more than an air pollution monitoring device; it provides continuous, on-line, real-time monitoring for air pollution at multi location and air pollution warning or alert system. This system also offers low implementation, operation and maintenance cost of ownership because the surveillance cameras become cheaper and cheaper now."
1849709,21349,11104,Monitoring Sea Level by Radar Altimeter and CGPS in the North-Western Mediterranean,2008,"Sea level is an environmental variable which is widely recognised as being important in many scientific disciplines as a control parameter for coastal dynamical processes or climate processes in the coupled atmosphere-ocean systems, as well as engineering applications. A major source of sea-level data are the national networks of coastal tide gauges, in Spain belonging to different institutions as the Instituto Geografico Nacional (IGN), Puertos del Estado (PE), Instituto Hidrografico de la Marina (IHM), etc. Three Spanish sites for monitoring sea level are located in Ibiza island, l'Estartit and Barcelona. L'Estartit tide gauge is a classical floating tide gauge set up in l'Estartit harbour (NE Spain) in 1990. Data are taken in graphics registers from which each two hours the mean value is recorded in an electronic support and delivered to the Permanent Service for Mean Sea level (PSMSL). Periodic surveying campaigns along the year are carried out for monitoring possible vertical movement of the geodetic benchmark adjacent to the tide gauge. In the framework of a Spanish Space Project, the instrumentation of sea level measurements has been improved by providing the Barcelona site with a radar tide gauge and with a continuous GPS station nearby. The radar tide gauge is a Datamar 3000C device and a Thales Navigation Internet- Enabled GPS Continuous Geodetic Reference Station (iCGRS) with a choke ring antenna. It is intended that the overall system will constitute a CGPS Station of the ESEAS (European Sea Level) and TIGA (GPS Tide Gauge Benchmark Monitoring) networks. Puertos del Estado (Spanish Harbours) installed the tide gauge station at Ibiza harbour in lanuary 2003. The station belongs to the REDMAR network, composed at this moment by 21 stations distributed along the whole Spanish waters, including also the Canary islands (http://www.puertos.es). The tide gauge also belongs to the ESEAS (European Sea Level) network. Also it has a radar tide gauge at Barcelona harbour.A description of the actual infrastructure at Ibiza, l'Estartit and Barcelona is presented and its applications to sea level monitoring and altimeter calibration in support of the main CGPS at Ibiza harbour. Three Begur Cape experiences on radar altimeter calibration and marine geoid mapping were made on 1999, 2000 and 2002. One campaign was also made in lune 2003 at the Ibiza island area. GPS buoys and GPS catamaran were used. We present a synthesis of the sea level results results obtained from TOPEX/POSEIDON and JASON-1 altimeter calibration campaigns using the direct measurements from GPS buoys and the derived marine geoid. The main objective of the marine campaigns is to check the value of Ibiza Island as a permanent calibration site in the western Mediterranean Sea, to complement the Corsica site in the network of altimeter calibration sites.Now there is preparation for a new Ibiza/Cape of Begur altimeter calibration campaign after launch of JASON-2 at the Vanderbergh site scheduled on lune 20, 2008."
2229715,21349,11104,Use of tandem pairs of ERS-2 and ENVISAT SAR data for the analysis of oceanographic and atmospheric processes,2007,"Currently the European satellites ERS-2 and ENVISAT are flying on the same orbit with a time separation of 30 minutes. In this presentation pairs of the respective synthetic aperture radar data are analyzed with respect to different atmospheric and oceanic processes. The presented results were obtained in the framework of the ESA AO project COTAR. The tandem configuration exists since the launch of ENVISAT in 2002. In the presentation an overview will be given of the available image pairs acquired over the ocean on a global scale. Combinations of ERS-2 SAR data with both image mode and wide swath mode scenes provided by the ENVISAT ASAR are considered. The two SAR images enable the analysis of the change of radar cross section within half an hour. This temporal separation is very interesting for oceanographic applications because there are many processes like atmospheric fronts, convective cells, ocean tides, etc., which are detectable on this time scale. In the presentation tandem pairs acquired over the research platform FINO west of the island Borkum in the North Sea will be presented. The area is of high practical interest because of the planned Offshore Windpark Borkum West. The platform provides wind measurements at different heights and additional oceanic information to support the planning activities for this windpark. The dynamics of atmospheric structures is analysed. It is well known that the near surface wind field is a dominating factor for the normalized radar cross section of the sea surface. For this reason SAR scenes are well suited to study atmospheric effects with high spatial resolution. It is shown that the use of tandem pairs enables the study of processes like the propagation of an atmospheric fronts or the evolution of convective cells. Both effects are illustrated with different examples using additional information from in situ measurements. Furthermore existing techniques for the estimation of the wind field in 10 m height from SAR data are applied to both images. The evolution of the spatial structure of both wind speed and wind direction is analysed. The observations are related to some theoretical issues like, e.g., the Taylor hypothesis. Particular emphasize is put on the connection between the spatial and the temporal structure of the wind field. This topic is of high practical relevance, e.g., in the context of offshore windenergy exploitation. Additional applications like ship tracking, oil spill detection and the study of ocean wave field dynamics are briefly discussed as well."
2352830,21349,11104,Quantitative hill-slope stability assessment with a remote sensing & GIS based distributed modeling scheme,2005,"As the development of the urbanization and the expansion of the infrastructure of China, landslide is becoming a concern of the people. The commonly-used approaches for landslide disaster warning include (1) field inspection using a check list to identify sites susceptible to landslides; (2) projection of future patterns of instability from analysis of landslide inventories; (3) multivariate analysis of factors characterizing observed sites of slope instability; (4) stability ranking based on criteria such as slope, lithology, land form, or geologic structure; and (5) failure probability analysis based on slope stability models with stochastic hydrologic simulations. Each of these is valuable for certain applications. None, however, takes full advantage of the fact that debris flow source areas are, in general, strongly controlled by surface topography through shallow subsurface flow convergence, increased soil saturation, increased pore pressures and shear strength reduction. Single landslide hazard prediction has achieved quite a few achievements [1-5] , and the results often cannot meet the needs for regional landslide hazard prediction. The hillslope stability refers to the distortion and damage probability of the hill-slope surface under the natural condition. The hill-slope stability is affected by many internal factors such as terrain slope, soil mechanics character, geological structure and external factors such as rainfall, surface water and ground water activities. Moreover, surface vegetation root system increases the sheer strength of soil; structure, texture and soil mechanics character characteristics that affect the strength and scope of the hill-slope stability. All these factors affect each other and different areas have different deformation mechanisms. Some models aims to give reliable prediction of slope disability have been proposed by the researchers, some of which have been successfully applied to the predication of the potential landslide hazard. The article selects the Lueyang County where the landslide develops typically near Hanzhong city of Shanxi province as the study area, SINMAP model was selected to integrate spatial information such as land use/land cover, soil type, vegetation root system development and historic landslide inventory to certify the surface hillslope stability of the study area, then a surface stability index mapping was produced from the statistics on the modeled results. Finally, hillslope stability mapping based on the modeled results were compared with those derived through extensive field observations in the same study area reported by Lu et al. (2003) to validate the validity and applicability of the model, and possible improvement of the model in the future studies are discussed briefly."
2506311,21349,11104,Corn monitoring and crop yield using optical and RADARSAT-2 images,2007,"In agriculture, soil and crop conditions change from day to day and throughout the growing season. Agricultural targets also vary spatially with differences observed from field to field, as well as within individual fields. The heterogeneity of corn-growing conditions in Mexico makes accurate data for crop type, crop condition and crop yield prediction difficult to obtain. Yield predictions are needed by the federal government to estimate, ahead of harvest time, the amount of corn required to be imported in order to meet the expected domestic shortfall. In this project a methodology for the estimation of corn yield ahead of harvest time is developed which uses radar and optical remote sensing and which specifically considers the corn-growing situation in Central Mexico. Radar based crop type classification requires data sets with multiple polarizations. Recent research to assess relative classification accuracies of multi-polarized combinations for target crops using airborne data has been reported. In addition to identifying crop type and variety, identifying crop growth stage is valuable. Crop condition, loosely defined as the vigor or health of a crop in a particular growth stage, is related to crop productivity and yield; however, the relationship is complex. Main crop condition indicators include biomass, height, leaf area and contents of plant water, chlorophyll and nitrogen. Crop-type and crop-condition mapping are among the applications that are expected to benefit the most from the technical enhancements embodied by RADARSAT-2. The potential of RADARSAT-1 data for these applications has been rated as limited, whereas for RADARSAT-2 data this potential is anticipated to be strong. The Science and Operational Applications Research for RADARSAT-2 Program (SOAR) is promoting the evaluation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities by providing images to selected research projects which include the present one.objectives of this project are: a) use RADARSAT-2 data and optical data to determine cultivated areas and monitor crop condition for obtaining better estimations of crop yield; b) obtain polarization signatures from RADARSAT-2 data for corn and relate these to Leaf Area Index and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) crop parameters and vegetation indexes, to establish indicators of crop condition and produce estimates for crop yield; c) use field data collected for three key corn crop growth stages over 300 pilot plots during 2001-2006, and increase the number of plots to build a database to support accuracy studies using RADARSAT-2 data.The expected benefits of this project are: to obtain knowledge about crop type, crop condition and crop yield with better accuracy than with current methodologies; to support national corn farmers associations; to design agriculture related activities within State agriculture plans; to support the corn product industry and aid government decision making. Relevant results and economical impact will imply operational usage of RADARSAT- 2 data in the agricultural sector in Mexico."
2047776,21349,11104,RS-based analysis of land cover change in the region surrounding Tianshengqiao No.1 hydropower reservoir before and after its construction,2004,"Construction of hydroelectric projects has often been linked to negative environmental effects, such as climate change, decline of amount or diversity of aquatic life, fragmentation of natural habitat, disturbance of natural sedimentation processes, and land cover change. These effects occur because reservoir construction disturbs the natural hydrological process and human activities change land cover. This has lead to numerous studies on land use/cover change (LUCC) caused by hydro power construction. This research investigated the LUCC impact of a specific hydropower station, Tianshengqiao No.1, using satellite data. Result showed that its construction had slightly adverse effects on land cover and landscape structure. Tianshengqiao No.1 hydropower station is located in southwest China on the border of Guizhou Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. With a controlled catchment area of 50 139 km/sup 2/ and installed capacity 1200 MW, it is the first in the series of cascade hydropower stations along the Hongshuihe River, which is the upper reach of the Pearl River with rich hydroelectric potential. This project involved six counties in three provinces and took ten years to construct (1990-2000) with a total investment of 8.4 billion RMB. Remote sensing has been widely used to study land cover change. It is well suited to study rugged terrain surrounding Tianshengqiao No.1. In this study, ENVI software was used to geoprocess and classify Landsat TM images. ArcView and Photoshop were used to make two land use maps, and FRAGSTATS calculation method was applied in landscape ecological structure analysis. This study analyzed land cover before and after the construction of the hydropower station using 1987 and 2002 TM images for a 2520 km/sup 2/ area surrounding Tianshengqiao No.1. FRAGSTATS was used to analyze seven representative quantitative indices of landscape spatial structure and heterogeneity. Result showed that land cover in the region surrounding Tianshengqiao No.1 was moderately influenced by the hydropower construction. The share of land cover in shrubbery, which was the largest before the construction, decreased from 33% to 20%. Grassland became the most widespread land use pattern in 2002 TM image, increasing from 31% to 39% over the study period. The change in land cover from shrub-dominated to grass-dominated implies certain degree of land degradation, which needs to be monitored. The analysis of landscape structure and landscape heterogeneity indicates that in the past 15 years, landscape spatial pattern in this region has tended to become fragmented and diversified, which indicates that the construction of Tianshengqiao No.1 may have had other important effects on landscape pattern."
2407366,21349,11104,Extracting tree crown properties from ground-based scanning laser data,2007,"The spatial organization of above-ground plant material plays an important role in controlling not only plant functional activities like photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, but also the photo-vegetation interactions. To improve our understanding of such interactions, the acquisition of highly detailed information about the 3D architecture of individual plants and communities of plants is required. Recently, Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, both at the ground and the airborne-level, have emerged as useful tools for mapping 3D plant structure. One such ground-based instrument is the Intelligent Laser Ranging and Imaging System (ILRIS 3D), which was developed at Optech Incorporated. This laser scanner, generates a 3D digital reconstruction of any scene, by actively emitting laser pulses and recording the time elapsed for the return of a pulse, thereby measuring the distance of any given object. It is the objective of this research to utilize the ILRIS 3D to measure structural, and biophysical information of individual trees for use as direct inputs into complex radiative transfer models. The key parameters under investigation are crown dimensions (i.e. shape, area, and volume), crown-level gap fraction (GF) and crown- level leaf area index (LAI). The ILRIS 3D was used to acquire 3D point clouds of an artificial 6' Ficus tree, in a controlled laboratory environment. Measured XYZ point cloud data was segmented to retrieve laser pulse return density profiles, which subsequently were used to estimate gap fraction and LAI . Gap fraction estimates were cross-validated with traditional methods of histogram thresholding of digital photographs (r 2  = 0.96). Crown LAI estimates were compared with the actual values (r 2  = 0.95, RMSE = 0.45). The next challenge was to implement the developed algorithms to real crowns, namely olive (Olea europaea L.) orchards in southern Spain. Individual tree-level ILRIS 3D data was collected from 24 structurally diverse crowns. Crown dimensional profiles were extracted for ILRIS data that was collected from a horizontal view (i.e ground-based) and a nadir view (i.e from platform 12 meters above ground). Preliminary retrievals from the olive orchards dataset is described here, while current ongoing field measurements are being conducted to validate the findings. Successful demonstration of extracting crown-level structural parameters like gap fraction and LAI from ground-based LiDAR will be important new information that can be used for detailed radiative transfer modeling in olive orchards and likely lead to more robust inversion algorithms."
1998227,21349,11104,Experiments of soil moisture retrieval based on Extended Kalman filter,2009,"This paper is intended to investigate the sensing of surface parameters by microwave radiometry. A Extended Kalman filter(EKF) is developed to manage the nonlinear relationship between surface parameters and radiometric signatures. Its performance of retrieving plant water content (PWC) and soil moisture content (SMC) from brightness temperatures is examined by using both predictions from model simulations and measurements from field experiments. It calculates background error covariance matrix using EKF method and is able to resolve the nonlinearity and discontinuity exist within model operator and observation operator. We optimize the observing scheme for sensing surface soil moisture (SM) from simulated brightness temperatures by the EKF. The frequencies of interest include 6.9 and 10.7 GHz of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), and 1.4 GHz (L-band) of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sensor. The Land Surface Process/Radiobrightness (LSP/R) model is used to provide time series of both SM and brightness temperatures at 6.9 and 10.7 GHz for AMSR's viewing angle of 55 degrees, and at L-band for SMOS's multiple viewing angles of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 degrees. These multiple frequencies and viewing angles allow us to design a variety of observation modes to examine their sensitivity to SM. For example, L-band brightness temperature at any single look angle is regarded as an L-band 1D observation mode. Meanwhile, it can be combined with either the observation at other angles to become an L-band 2D mode or a multiple dimensional observation mode, or with the observation at 6.9 or 10.7 GHz to become a multiple frequency/dimensional observation mode. In this study, it is shown that the L-band 1D radiometric observation is sensitive to SM. The sensitivity can be increased by incorporating radiometric observation either from a second angle, or from multiple look angles, or from any of the two lowest AMSR channels. In addition, the advantage of an L-band 2D mode or a multiple dimensional observation mode over an L-band 1D observation mode is demonstrated. Moreover, we investigate the best observing configuration for sensing plant water content (PWC) and soil moisture content (SMC) profiles from the measured H- and V-polarized brightness temperatures at 1.4 (L-band) by the EKF. The brightness temperatures were taken by the ESTAR radiometer in SGP97 experiment. The radiometer was used to measure brightness temperatures at incident angles from −45 to 45 degrees at L-band. The SMC profiles were measured to the depths of 10 cm. The VWC was computed by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values for the entire region using the TM data collected on July 2 5, 1997. The EKF was trained with observations randomly chosen from the ESTAR data of SGP97, and evaluated by the remaining data from the same set. The results indicate that the EKF can significantly improve the soil moisture estimation in the surface Iayer. And we think that the Extended Kalman filter is both practical and effective for assimilating in situ observation into land surface models."
2303778,21349,11104,Vegetation water inversion using MODIS satellite data,2007,"The vegetation water condition is determined by soil water content. So soil water condition can be reflected by means of vegetation water condition indirectly. There have been many detailed studies on crop water stress index from the micrometeoological aspect before, for example, CWSI (crop water stress index) and crop water stress microclimatic model based on CWSI. The generation of these indices need many meteorological data and is not suitable to regional water stress study because of the difficulties in limitation of data acquisition of related data on the surface. Moreover, there are a few relevant studies using remote sensing techniques, such as WDI (water deficit index), VCI (vegetation condition index) and TCI (temperature condition index). Although these indices are suitable to regional study, they utilize the statistic value of remote sensing data for years and they are on the basis of pixel scale. Therefore, the precision of quantitatively assessing surface water is limited to some extent. In view of problems of these water stress indices, this article is going to discuss a not only simple but also reasonable method to derive vegetation water. Different vegetation water condition could cause the variation of vegetation spectrum, so vegetation water stress can be shown by remote sensing vegetation indices, such as vegetation condition index and anomaly vegetation index et al. In view of this, soil water content can be assessed indirectly. But vegetation indices neglect some environment factors, eg. temperature and precipitation. The less evaportranspiration, the higher vegetation and soil temperatures. Therefore the vegetation temperature is a direct indicator of vegetation water stressed and drought. In a word, the soil water is positive correlation with vegetation index and negative correlation with temperature. It takes the North-West semi-arid area - Xilingole district of Inner Mongolia as study area. Different degraded grasslands are selected as objects in this study. MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) has thirty-six bands of visible/near-infrared and thermal infrared with abundant information. This study selects MODIS as data source. In consideration of the spectral character of MODIS data and different degraded grasslands, the reflective spectrum of vegetation is greatly affected by soil. MSAVI (modified soil- adjusted vegetation index) is selected to weaken the disturbanceof soil information. MSAVI and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) are deduced using one visible band (0.66 mum) and two near-infrared bands (0.86 mum, 1.24 mum). In order to estimate the vegetation water more accurately. Vegetation component temperature is inversed using two thermal infrared bands (8.6 mum, 11 mum) according to the emissivity distribution of vegetation with the wavelength from eight to twelve micrometer and the correlation analysis of MODIS data. Sequentially, the vegetation water synthesis index is acquired by analyzing the coupling character of three indexes, which can reflect the vegetation water condition. Then the vegetation water content can be extracted using the synthesis index effectively. Lastly, the vegetation water content is validated using measured data. The matching results show that the synthesis index is directly proportional to the measured data. It proves that the synthesis index and the vegetation water content are credible and the method is reasonable. This study has discussed a new method to know the regional vegetation water condition from satellite remote sensing data directly and quickly."
2286172,21349,11104,Application of real time dynamic Sensor Web measurement techniques to maximize Aura/TES useful science return,2004,"The Sensor Web characterizes a future observing system concept that has the potential to significantly increase useful science data return. It accomplishes this by intelligently and dynamically reconfiguring the measurement and information processing states of its constituent sensor, computing, and storage nodes. To explore the potential benefits of Sensor Web observing strategies for the Earth science community, the Goddard Space Flight Center is developing software to demonstrate the value of real-time, collaborative, intelligent data collection between two formation flying spacecraft that comprise NASA's EOS ''A-Train constellation: Aqua and Aura. After its planned Summer 2004 launch, Aura, with its Troposphere Emission Spectrometer (TES), is to be inserted into the constellation's orbital plane and follow 15 minutes behind Aqua with its Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. MODIS is a nadir pointing multispectral imager, it is always ON, and its 36 bands can be used to detect clouds. TES is a high-resolution infrared-imaging Fourier transform spectrometer designed primarily to study ozone in the lower atmosphere. Providing spectral coverage in the mid- to thermal IR bands, it is undesirable for TES to make measurements within cloud obscured fields of view. Of particular significance, TES is a pointable instrument: it can be commanded to image any target within 45deg of the local vertical. In this paper, we describe a high performance prototype software system to acquire and process direct readout MODIS data to a Level 2 cloud mask product in real time. Using a predefined list of desired targets, in conjunction with the real time MODIS cloud mask information, the software generates simulated commands and point TES to only those targets that are cloud free to demonstrate the value of intelligent data collection measurement techniques. To further refine where within the cloud free regions TES should point, we are also assessing the potential use of atmospheric chemistry models whose outputs may provide an additional set of criteria for high science value target selection. Similar event-driven and model-driven adaptive observation strategies and dynamic measurement techniques may be applied to future sensor Web Earth- and space-science missions"
238729,21349,11104,Analysis of Sentinel-1 mission capabilities,2009,"The Sentinel-1 mission is designed to be a source of continuous and reliable collection of C-band SAR imagery. Requirements for Sentinel-1 end to end system, as part of the complete family of GMES Sentinels, guarantee continuity of C-band SAR data and products availability to operational entities who exploit satellite radar imagery since ERS 1 operations [1]. Typical drivers for current- and future-generation Remote Sensing LEO satellite missions are fast target access capabilities and short on-board data latency in order to speed up the operations of data download and products' delivery to the end-users. On the other hand complete or almost complete Earth surface coverage is also required from the system. Satellite orbit and sensor swath determine the access capability so that the mission timeliness performance can only improve at the cost of increasing the number of satellites (constellation concept). SAR power demand limits the satellite operational duty cycle implying the need for trade-off between frequent acquisition of the same targets and extension of acquisition surface coverage. A balance between fast access/response to (or frequent revisit of) a few regions of interest and maximization of geographical coverage within the satellite orbit repeat cycle is thus needed when none of the above goals prevail as the main mission driver. Sentinel-1 applies a new operational mission concept; SAR acquisitions by Sentinel-1A (and Sentinel-1B when the constellation will be deployed) are designed according to pre-defined operational sequences to ensure: 1. continuous and systematic acquisition of data all along the mission time (to maximize mission return and system exploitation efficiency) 2. a growing archive of “world-wide extended” data 3. maximum extension of coverage after any orbit repeat cycle (175 orbits in 12 days) 4. minimum possible revisit time on few selected regions (North Atlantic Maritime Transport zones, Europe and Canada) but also 5. possibility to include and perform, as an additional mission capability, sporadic data acquisitions coming from asynchronous user orders submitted to the system following for example requests for specific imagery during emergency occurrences. The mission analysis process performed to define in detail the above operational concept is outlined in this paper and results are presented."
975094,21349,11104,Using GIS for spatio-temporal assessment of some physicochemical parameters in the bay of Algiers,2015,"This work proposes a procedure to quantify spatiotemporal variation of some coastal water quality parameters measured in the bay of Algiers by implementing a Geographical Information System (GIS). The study area is the receptacle of several and various pollution sources which has significant impacts on the marine environment. Therefore, several studies are conducted [1], [2] and campaigns are organized each year in order to measure physicochemical parameters to assess the impact of those sources of pollution on the coastal water quality. Nevertheless, those measurements are punctual and spatially irregular making spatiotemporal analysis slightly difficult. However, environmental managers often require spatially continuous data over the region of interest to make effective and confident decisions and scientists need accurate spatially continuous data across a region to make justified interpretations [3]. Indeed, to obtain an estimate of the parameters in a continuous space, we calculate interpolated grids for each parameter using the appropriate interpolation method (Inverse Distance Weighted, Ordinary kriging, etc.). The purpose of monitoring the qualitative and quantitative parameters of aquatic ecosystems (springs, streams, rivers, fiords, estuaries, offshore and marine waters) is the approximation and estimation of their environmental situation and trends [4]. Traditionally, the spatiotemporal assessment of a parameter measured in mainland is done by observing the evolution of measured values at all stations all along the time axis or by calculating a mean value for each date. In [5], spatiotemporal assessment of a multi-decadal European climate dataset is done by using temporal GIS TGrass; seasonal temperature trends of Europe and some capitals were given by calculating mean temperatures. At sea, things are different; the measured stations are not stationary and there's very low probability for a site to be measured more than once especially when campaigns are organized by different operators. To make possible the spatiotemporal assessment cited previously, we propose in this study, a procedure to do the analysis on a configuration of not sampled or theoretical stations but representative of any changes. The physicochemical measurements associated with these theoretical stations will be retrieved from the estimated respective grids. The spatiotemporal assessment can be done so on the basis of these theoretical but fixed stations. Value-added products are also obtained from the GIS such as spatial distribution maps with a representation of iso-value curves of each parameter. This procedure is especially interesting when one wants to analyze multi-sources (from different campaigns) in-situ measurements."
1600090,21349,11104,A comparative study to the 2011/2013 water quality assessments in the Pasquotank Watershed in Northeastern North Carolina with a sea level rise component,2015,"The Pasquotank River Watershed is found in Northeast North Carolina beginning in the Great Dismal Swamp at the Virginia/North Carolina border and flows into the Albemarle Sound. The watershed provides a transition between spawning grounds and the waters of the Albemarle Sound. The sound serves as a nursery area for many fish species and is home to numerous sport and commercial species. Due to indications of rising global temperature and the monitoring of melting ice sheets, these coastal watersheds could be a leading indicator of rising sea levels as their chemical compositions changes. The effects of sea-level rise were also taken into consideration for future monitoring. The 2014 Research Experience for Undergraduates Pasquotank River Watershed Team completed two sets of tests of five tributaries and the river itself. These test points were derived from the 2011 and 2013 Watershed Team research projects with the addition of four points created to sample further downstream in the Pasquotank River itself. Results were compared with previous readings utilizing a Water Quality Index (WQI). The streams tested were the Pasquotank River, Newbegun Creek, Knobbs Creek, Areneuse Creek, Mill Dam Creek, and Sawyers Creek. These streams, along with the river, cover a large portion of the watershed and provide a wide area of study for the watershed. Tests performed in the laboratory on this year's samples included pH, salinity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity. Air/water temperature, dissolved oxygen, wind speed/direction, and turbidity/clarity measurements were taken in the field. The results collected were placed online and displayed in correlation to their position utilizing Google Maps. The data were then compared to the 2011 and 2013 project results and examined for any variations or similarities. It was found that the water quality for some water sources remained in their respective ranges from the past years. The others, such as Knobbs Creek, varied from the previous years. Newbegun Creek, with a water quality index of 59, stayed within the two previous teams' WQI of 50 (2011) and 66 (2013). Mill Dam Creek had a very slight increase in water quality from the previous teams' readings 47 (2013) and 48 (2011) but still managed to acquire a bad reading of 49. Areneuse Creek increased from 49 (2011) and 47 (2013) to reach a medium water quality of 57. The Pasquotank River, ranking as the lowest, has dropped significantly from 64 (2011) to 44 (2013) and continued to be lower in 2014 standing at 41 for its WQI. Sawyers Creek remained consistent between 54 (2011) and 50 (2013) at a low medium range with this year's water quality being 51. Knobbs Creek WQI, having the highest water quality reading, increased from the two past readings of 52 (2011) and 50 (2013) with a WQI of 63."
2464442,21349,11104,Mapping of field capacity and wilting coefficient in china for drought monitoring,2005,"Water is held in the soil pores by weaker capillary forces. When a soil is sufficiently wet, its capillary forces can hold no more water and the soil is at field capacity. Field capacity reflects the water holding capacity of the soil. Most agricultural crops require irrigation through the dry season, harvest, and after harvest. Specific water needs can be very different from one crop to another and, for the same crop, depend on soil type and climate. Some crops benefit in the quality of fruit produced when the soil water content is regulated during a specific growth stage of the plant. Some crops are sensitive to too much water in the soil, while other crops are sensitive to minor fluctuations in soil water content in the root zone during the growing season. Before a crop’s water needs can be addressed, and a specific water management program can be established, several important plant and soil parameters need to be determined. Field capacity of the soil is one of the important parameters. As a soil begins to dry out, however, increasingly stronger forces hold the pore water until a point is reached when plants can no longer extract any water from the soil. This state of soil moisture is the wilting coefficient of a soil. The wilting coefficient for a crop in a particular soil means that the water in the soil can no longer be easily extracted by plant and the plant begins to wilt. The method of field capacity is douche of sample in the field usually. The sample in the field was saturated with water, and was allowed to gravity drain for a few days. Then you can obtain the soil water content in the balance of the soil water. This method is more fit to the real condition of the field, but not fit to the soil in which the osmosis is very bad. The method of wilting coefficient is biological method usually. The sample in the field was used to plant the crop in the lab until the crop begins to wilt because of the deficit of the water. The measurements of the two soil parameters are very complicated. coefficient because of many influencing factors, such as differences in soil texture, content of organic matter and the mode of the use of soil. Field capacity and wilting coefficient of a soil vary with each factor. Soil texture is a physical property of soil and is determined by the percentages of soil separates. Content of organic matter will affect the hole of soil and the arranging mode of soil grains. The mode of planting will affect the physical and chemic character of soil. Usually we think the two soil parameters are relative changeless year by year, they fluctuate from year to year in a specific range in fact. Because of complicated determine method of soil parameters and too much influencing factors, some scholars put forward models to calculate field capacity, but quantifying each factor is very difficult, so the model may be adaptive to a section. Researches usually use the observed data in the field. The observed data are not easily collected and not uniform, so the data researches used may be observed long before. Water in the soil between field capacity and wilting coefficient is the plant available water. Once you know the soil’s field capacity and wilting coefficient, you will know the soil’s total amount of plant available water. Soil water condition combined with the plant available water is used to master the law of variety in the soil water, and the intensity of transpiration and evaporation combined with the plant available water is used to analyze available water in the soil for some crop in different period of growth, then you can make irrigation schedule, regulated deficit irrigation, water conservation in agriculture. Drought could be reflected through monitoring the growth condition of the crop, while the growth condition of the crop rests with the soil available water. When the water extracted from soil can’t meet the requirement of the crop, the crop would be in the condition of drought and the growth would be affected. Knowing the two soil parameters, you can calculate the relative soil moisture through monitoring the real soil water, and analyze whether the soil water can meet the need of crop, then you can judge whether the drought for a crop could happen. Considering the need and broad application of the two soil parameters, mapping the countrywide field capacity and wilting coefficient are proposed."

In this concept the full-rate data are stored, for a short burst, into an internal buffer memory, in parallel to the normal averaging and other functions of the instrument. The buffered data are subsequently read out at a much lower rate and appended to the normal science data. These Individual Echoes (IE) are, therefore, not processed onboard in the same way that the nominal RA-2 waveforms are.Recent studies have demonstrated that through the full rate data it is possible to discover some behaviour than cannot be seen with the averaged data. Moreover, it is the first time in altimetry that we have echoes that contain the information of the phase. This is a great potential for new science studies. This paper describes the algorithm applied on-ground to the IE of the RA-2 Burst Waveforms to reproduce the same process done by the instrument on-board (except for the averaging). Once this algorithm is applied to the IE they will be in the same condition than the normal RA-2 telemetred average waveform, but at 100 time higher surface sampling and with the phase information. The final objective of this work is the use of the IE fully processed and instrument calibrated for calibration, validation and science exploitation purposes. We will present results of studies carried out using these IE. The blurring on the averaged waveforms depends on the total movement of the range window [1], which in turn depends on slope of the terrain, the orbit slope and ultimately, how well the on-board tracker tracks that particular waveform shape. In early studies using ERS data, the blurring on the averaged waveforms has been estimated by simulating the ERS range window movement during tracking. Using individual echoes there is no longer the need to do so, we can directly use these echoes. The IE will be averaged in the correct way and compared to the averaged waveform provided in the nominal RA-2 product. Changes on the retracked epoch and slope of the leading edge can be assessed for different type of waveforms over different surfaces. In particular we will present results of the analysis of the behaviour of IE over the Salar D'Uyuni in Bolivia, to better understand biases in retracking of specular echoes. The results can be used to improve the current understanding of retracked elevations over sea ice and help to improve tuning of current sea ice retracking schemes for the EnviSat RA-2 instrument. ESA has run a study on this topic to seed the use of individual echoes by scientists. This study is completed and reconstructed echoes will be made available for the first time to the scientific community. Final results from the technical and scientific application of individual echoes and S band data are described in [3]."
1994431,21349,11104,Comparison and evaluation between MODIS vegetation indices in Northwest China,2007,"The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) VI products provide consistent, spatial, and temporal comparisons of global vegetation conditions that can be used to monitor the Earth's terrestrial photosynthetic activity. In order to compare and evaluate the ability that the MODIS two indices (VI) , the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) , monitor vegetation over a diverse range of biomes in Northwest China, the MODIS vegetation index products data set were used, which are from NASA LP DAAC(Land Process Distributed Active Archive Center) and have 250m resolution and 16-day composting periods in 2004.Different vegetation types including broadleaf forests, needleleaf forests, meadows, grassland, steppes, scrubs, desert and cultivated vegetation were chosen as representative types, based on Vegetation Map of Northwest China. Two CE-313 radiancements, which is portable instrument and has five filters between 450 and 1650 nm, were used to collect the spectrum data for calculating vegetation indices over different vegetation types in the plants growth season. The levels of vegetation cover were observed at the same spots and the same time when the CE-313 radiancements worked. The results show that the NDVI was higher than the EVI in most part of Northwest China. The difference between the two indices increased from deserts, steppes, cultivated vegetation, meadows to forest. Both NDVI and EVI were well indicated the distribution and the growth of various vegetations in arid and semi-arid area. The NDVI saturated in these high biomass types vegetations, such as broadleaf forests, needleleaf forests, meadows and part of cultivated vegetation, during the plants blooming period. The NDVI did not increase with the growth of these vegetations during the period. The EVI was different. It increased with the growth of vegetation. The NDVI saturation threshold was about 0.8. The length of the period that NDVI saturating was different from 1 to 5 months with the type of vegetation. The length of the period of broadleaf forests was the longest and that of the cultivated vegetation was the shortest. Though the height of high-cold meadows was not higher than forty cm in northeast of Tibetan Plateau, the NDVI of these regions saturated for 2 months during the plants flourished. The data gotten from the CE-313 showed that the NDVI of many kinds vegetation, for example, winter wheat, corn, clover blossom and forb high cold meadows, may saturate during the process of becoming mature. Crossplots of the two Vis showed a curvilinear relationship between them, such that the NDVI always had higher values but appeared to reach an asymptotic maximum value. When the NDVI was about 0.8, the NDVI was almost stop responding with the vegetation density while the EVI was still responding. Both NDVI and EVI have a good linear correlation with the levels of vegetation cover according to the data gotten from the CE-313. The Correlation of EVI was better than that of NDVI especially in the higher levels vegetation cover. The Correlation coefficient of EVI was 0.8112 and the NVDI was 0.6946."
2969363,21349,11104,"Comparative analysis of vegetation indices, non-parametric and physical retrieval methods for monitoring nitrogen in wheat using UAV-based multispectral imagery",2016,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based remote sensing offers great possibilities to acquire in a fast and convenient way field data for precision agriculture applications. The UAV-based multispectral images with five wavebands (490, 550, 671, 700, 800 nm) were obtained at five growth stages from consecutive two years' wheat field experiments with different combinations in variety, N application rate and planting density. In this paper, we compared systematically leaf nitrogen content (LNC) estimation accuracy and processing speed of a multitude of vegetation indices (VIs), non-parametric and physically-based model retrieval methods. With regard to vegetation indices, most possible band combinations with existing five bands and a linear regression fitting function have been evaluated. The best performing index was optimized three-band combination 2.5(R 800 -R 700 )/(R 800 +6R 700 -7.5R 490 ) according to EVI (Enhanced vegetation index) for LNC with 10-fold cross-validation determination (R2) of 0.73. This method shows especially fast processing speed (0.03 s). As for non-parametric methods, 14 common regression algorithms have been evaluated. Among these algorithms, Random Forest [TreeBagger] is the best performing method with R 2  of 0.79 for LNC. This method has the advantage of making use of the full optical spectrum as well as flexible, nonlinear fitting. Additionally, the model is trained and validated relatively fast (2.3 s). Compared with the front two methods, it remains a challenge to estimate the canopy nitrogen through inversion of a PROSAIL based radiative transfer model (RTM). After the generation of a look-up table (LUT), a number of cost functions and regularization options were evaluated for inversion of LCC (leaf chlorophyll content). Inversion of nitrogen indirectly relying on inversion of LCC based on the empirical linear relationship between LCC and LNC. Although this method offered per-pixel estimation, generation of a look-up table and image processing took considerably more time. Besides, the validation performed less reliable. To sum up, Random Forest [TreeBagger] provides fast and accurate estimation of nitrogen using UAV-acquired multispectral imagery which will be good basis for remote sensing of canopy nitrogen status in a wide range of crop."
2089658,21349,11104,Digital multi-image photogrammetry combined with oblique aerial photography enables glacier monitoring survey flights below clouds in Alaska,2004,"Usually bad weather for aerial surveys in mountain terrain means something like normal weather. Only exceptionally good weather conditions can be used successful for vertical aerial photography. In the coastal mountains of Alaska this kind of weather is rare enough to seriously hamper survey activities. Recognizing this problem, a method for survey flights that can deal with far less than ideal weather conditions was developed and is now being tested in a joint venture with the USGS Glaciology section in Fairbanks, Alaska. Our current study is focused on evaluating a new, self contained approach to study high mountain geomorphology using a close range remote sensing method with a low flying light aircraft as a basis for digital oblique aerial photogrammetry. With a special type of camera and digital multiimage photogrammetry system its now possible to extract DEM (Digital Elevation Models) from oblique aerial photography, acquired out of the open window of almost any light aircraft. With this method the aircraft is not bound to a straight flight path and can move freely around and over the target area. This allows it to fly very close to a specific target and get a very high accuracy, depending on target size and distance to it. Even more important, any weather good enough for normal photography and mountain flying can be used to get data There are few restrictions on the weather unlike in the case of the usual vertical aerial photography, which requires clear skies, no clouds, and is hampered by strong thermal activity in the air. Especially in a oceanic high mountain weather environment this is a significant advantage, since weather delays are significantly reduced. Depending on target area location, it here is normal to fly low under the clouds within the mountain valleys and approach the photo destination. With this method one flys around the target and takes the measurement pictures from all sides of it, under the clouds. If weather conditions allow, vertical pictures can also be used and built into the system. Usually the accuracy is as good as with vertical aerial standard cameras and operator measured photogrammetry systems. With digital multiimage photogrammetry automated surface measurements are now possible and produce good results. The mating of the camera with a DGPS and a INS unit would create approximate camera positions, that could lead to establishing this method as a survey without the necessity of ground control (GCP's) in the near future"
1794650,21349,11104,Robust radiometric terrain correction for SAR image comparisons,2004,"We demonstrate a robust technique for radiometric terrain correction, whereby terrain-induced modulations of the radiometry of SAR imagery are modelled and corrected. The resulting normalized images may be more easily compared with other data sets acquired at different incidence angles, even opposing look directions. We begin by reviewing the radar equation, pointing out simplifications often made to reduce the complexity of calculating the backscatter coefficient, normalized either by ground area (sigma 0 ), or illuminated area projected into the look direction (gamma 0 ). The integral over the illuminated area is often approximated by a scale factor modelling a simple planar slope, departing only slightly from ideal flat terrain: for gamma 0 , the radar brightness (beta 0 ) is normalized via modulation with the tangent of the local incidence angle. We quantify the radiometric errors introduced by ignoring terrain variations, comparing results based on (a) a robust radar image simulation-based approach properly modelling variations in local illuminated area, and (b) an ellipsoidal Earth assumption. A second simplification often made in solving for backscatter using the radar equation is the assumption that the local antenna gain does not vary significantly from a simple model draping the antenna gain pattern (AGP) across an Earth ellipsoid, returning the local antenna gain as a function of slant range alone. In reality, the AGP is draped across the Earth's rolling terrain retrieval of properly calibrated backscatter values should model these variations and compensate for them: although smaller than the errors caused by not property modelling variations in local illuminated area, they can be significant. We use well-calibrated and annotated ENVISAT ASAR images acquired over Switzerland to show how robust radiometric terrain correction, incorporating models for the variations of local illuminated area with terrain enables calibrated mixture of imagery acquired at differing incidence angles. Only robust retrieval of backscatter values enables such inter-mode comparisons - a capability that significantly reduces the required revisit time for monitoring changes to the radar backscatter. In conclusion, we describe a technique for combining a set of terrain-geocoded and radiometrically calibrated images derived from ascending and descending passes and multiple incidence angles to create composite radar backscatter maps. At each point, the contribution of each image to the composite is weighted according to its local resolution. The resulting composite image manifests relatively uniform high ground resolution, even in highly mountainous terrain"
320381,21349,11104,"Low cost, real-time GPS positional tracking on digital satellite images improves ground truth productivity",2004,"Field computers, palm-pilots and data storage devices are becoming smaller, more energy efficient and thus more practical to use in a wide variety of field data gathering scenarios. Validation of Earth observation (EO) data sets requires knowledge of greater positional precision as EO data resolution increases to metre and submetre scales. Software from a variety of commercial and public domain sources bridges the functionality gap that integrates stored digital images and real-time GPS data (with WAAS or subsequently corrected GPS-C technology). The software is currently user-friendly enough to allow for a seamless storage of positional field stop information linked with other instrument measurements or associated with georeferenced EO data in GIS databases. Examples presented here from several field campaigns indicate that in some cases, the increase in productivity was as high as 40-50%. This is especially true under cold weather conditions where freedom of movement, note taking and manual data recording are hampered. GPS positional information also allows several points or tracks to be collected in rapid succession, thus enabling two-dimensional information stops or area plots to be collected in addition to the traditional point location. The locations of terrain features are often readily recognizable on digital imagery. This allows for immediate verification and confirmation of the site. GPS data collection is not limited to two-dimensions, and real-time 3D (altitude) information can guide the user along constant hypsometric levels in the field. In other cases, processed and georeferenced EO data may contain thematic information that does not correspond to visual image-like characteristics. Navigation from these kinds of imagery to their corresponding field locations may be difficult in these circumstances. Real-time positional displays, however, may help guide the field worker to the correct location on the imagery to be visited. In conclusion, field use of integrating GPS technology with EO data in real-time can greatly increase the efficiency of data collection campaigns as well as reduce errors and questionable data since it allows for an immediate visual feedback and validation by the user."
2116302,21349,11104,The Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (IWRAP) Data Archive,2008,"The Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory (MIRSL) at the University of Massachusetts developed and operates the Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (IWRAP). With support from NASA, NOAA, and ONR, UMASS has collaborated with NOAA-NESDIS and NOAA-AOC to operate the instrument aboard the NOAA WP-3D Hurricane Hunter aircraft since the 2002 hurricane season and for four winter experiments sampling high-latitude storms. The goals of these experiments have been to characterize storm boundary layers and to develop improved retrievals for space-based scatterometers, specifically, NASA SeaWinds Scatterometer on QuikSCAT and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) which was developed by ESA on behalf of EUMETSAT IWRAP is a conically-scanning, dual-frequency (C- and Ku-band) coherent radar with dual-polarization capability. The incidence angles are nominally: 30, 35, 40, and 50 degrees. At times, the instrument has been configured to address specific scientific and engineering problems. Examples include: C-band measurements of high incidence angle backscatter for ASCAT validation, and C-band horizontal polarization measurements to develop a high wind speed geophysical model function (GMF). Independent measurements of surface wind speed and column integrated rain rate are made coincidently with the UMass Simultaneous Frequency Radiometer (USFMR) and AOC Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR). Since 2005, IWRAP has operated in a raw data mode, recording individual radar pulses to enable the separation of near surface backscatter contributions (i.e. surface scattering versus volume scattering). The intensity of tropical cyclones ranged from tropical storm to category five hurricane, and high-latitude storms with up to hurricane force winds. Currently, we are post-processing and standardizing IWRAP raw data collected since 2005. This effort is intended to expand the utility of IWRAP and (USFMR/SFMR) measurements beyond the scope of the initially proposed research projects by making a standardized dataset available to the larger scatterometer community as well as the hurricane and high-latitude storms research communities. We provide an overview of IWRAP, the data it has collected, describe the processing effort, give the current status, and outline a schedule of data availability."
2438536,21349,11104,ENVISAT's capabilities for global monitoring of the hydrosphere,2005,"ENVISAT's ASAR Global Monitoring mode offers exciting capabilities for monitoring highly dynamic processes of the hydrosphere. Based on examples from different ecoregions (Africa, Siberia, Spain) we highlight the potential of this sensor system for monitoring wetlands and soil moisture. The hydrosphere is often called the water sphere as it includes all the earth's water that is found in the oceans, streams, lakes, the soil, groundwater, and in the air. Water is continually cycled between these various reservoirs through processes such as precipitation, melting, runoff, infiltration, and evaporation. Particularly these exchange processes and the highly dynamic water reservoirs (soil moisture, snow, streams, sea-ice) hold the key to our understanding of how the hydrosphere will react to global warming and increasing human pressure on the environment. Effective monitoring of these highly dynamic processes should therefore be a priority in earth observation. Unfortunately, we currently lack earth observation techniques which allow daily monitoring of the hydrosphere at a high spatial resolution (  1000 km), but are severely hampered by cloud cover and illumination conditions. Therefore, the effective temporal sampling interval is highly irregular, necessitating multi-temporal composting over time periods of one week or longer. Microwave systems are not restricted in this respect and, in addition, exhibit a high sensitivity to water. So while in principle they appear to be ideally suited, system design limitations have so far prevented widespread use. Microwave radiometers and scatterometers are characterized by short repeat intervals (  20 km). Therefore their use is limited to large-scale applications. Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) offer a high spatial resolution (< 100 m) but have so far been characterized by short duty cycles (acquisition time per orbit) and short swath width (< 100 km). Therefore, large-scale operational monitoring at acceptable time intervals has been out of question. ENVISAT offers now for the first time ScanSAR capabilities with a duty cycle of up to 100 %. However a relatively short swath width (405 km) and a large number of competing imaging modes results in sub-optimal temporal sampling intervals. Still, ENVISAT's ASAR Global Monitoring mode is well suited to explore the potential of ScanSAR techniques for monitoring the hydrosphere at scales compatible with AVHRR, MERIS or MODIS."
2387488,21349,11104,Canopy level solar induced fluorescence for vegetation in controlled experiments,2007,"Solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) was retrieved from high resolution canopy reflectance spectra acquired with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec spectroradiometer one meter above tree sapling canopies. Three deciduous tree species were examined during four measurement periods, spanning the two growing seasons in 2005 and 2006: tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). The Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principal was applied to above-canopy spectra for SIF retrievals at the two atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ) absorption features that occur in the chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) region (660-780 nm). The broader and deeper telluric feature centered at 760 nm, O 2 alpha, enables retrievals of SIF760 on the shoulder of the far-red ChlF peak. O 2 beta, although a narrower feature, is well positioned for SIF retrieval at 688 nm (SIF688) near the red ChlF peak. Canopy-level SIF688 for tree saplings varied between 1.1 and 2.9 (plusmn 0.3) mW m -2  nm -1  sr 1  while SIF760 varied between 0.5 and 1.3 (plusmn 0.15) mW m -2  nm -1  sr -1 . Typical values for the SIF red/far-red ratio (SIF688 / SIF760) ranged between 1.45 and 6.9, with the highest values observed in autumn. Contemporary canopy and leaf level measurements (e.g., fluorescence, F; reflectance; photosynthesis) were obtained. Leaf-level ChlF obtained from laboratory measurements of actively induced and solar-corrected fluorescence (SCF) emissions at the ChlF peaks (SCF685, SCF740) was determined for leaves of these tree species and three other species (corn, Zea mays L; green pepper, Capsicum annuum L; and soybean, Glycine max L.). For the trees, leaf-level estimates were determined at the SIF wavelengths (SCF688, SCF760) and compared with canopy field retrievals (SIF688, SIF760). The red ChlF values from leaf and canopy (SCF688 vs. SIF688) were similar, but SCF760 was ~4 times higher than SIF760; consequently, considerably (~5X) higher red/far-red ratios (SIF688/760) resulted for tree canopies as compared to individual tree leaves. The 2006 tree leaf and canopy SIF measurements were also compared with leaf-level SIF estimates derived using FluorMOD, a radiative transfer model that simulates F properties of foliage, utilizing our supporting leaf and environmental measurements as model inputs. The preliminary FluorMOD red and far-red SIF estimates were higher than our field measurements and higher than the laboratory estimates (except for far-red F). SIF of tree foliage was also compared with similar estimates made over corn crops under N treatments. These results will assist in determining the expected SIF intensity of vegetation's near- surface signal associated with O 2 alpha and O 2 beta."
1083253,21349,11104,The impact of aerosols on cloud and precipitation processes: cloud-resolving model simulations,2012,"• For all three cases, higher CCN produces smaller cloud droplets and a narrower spectrum. Dirty conditions delay rain formation, increase latent heat release above the freezing level, and enhance vertical velocities at higher altitude for all cases. Stronger updrafts, deeper mixed-phase regions, and more ice particles are simulated with higher CCN in good agreement with observations. • In all cases, rain reaches the ground early with lower CCN. Rain suppression is also evident in all three cases with high CCN in good agreement with observations (Rosenfeld, 1999, 2000 and others). Rain suppression, however, only occurs during the first hour of simulation. This result suggests that microphysical processes dominate the impact of aerosols on precipitation in the early stage of precipitation development. • During the mature stage of the simulations, the effect of increasing aerosol concentration ranges from rain suppression in the PRESTORM case to little effect on surface rainfall in the CRYSTAL-FACE case to rain enhancement in the TOGA COARE case. • The model results suggest that evaporative cooling is a key process in determining whether higher CCN reduces or enhances precipitation. Cold pool strength can be enhanced by stronger evaporation. When cold pool interacts with the near surface wind shear, the low-level convergence can be stronger, facilitating secondary cloud formation and more vigorous precipitation processes. Evaporative cooling is more than two times stronger at low levels with higher CCN for the TOGA COARE case during the early stages of precipitation development. However, evaporative cooling is slightly stronger at lower levels with lower CCN for the PRESTORM case. The early formation of rain in the clean environment could allow for the formation of an earlier and stronger cold pool compared to a dirty environment. PRESTORM has a very dry environment and both large and small rain droplets can evaporate. Consequently, the cold pool is relatively weaker, and the system is relatively less intense with higher CCN. • Sensitivity tests are conducted to determine the impact of ice processes on aerosol-precipitation interaction. The results suggested that ice processes are crucial for suppressing precipitation due to high CCN for the PRESTORM case. More and smaller ice particles are generated in the dirty case and transported to the trailing stratiform region. This reduces the heavy convective rain and contributes to the weakening of the cold pool. Warm rain processes dominate the TOGA COARE case. Therefore, ice processes only play a secondary role in terms of aerosol-precipitation interaction. • Two of the three cloud systems presented in this paper formed a line structure (squall system). A 2D simulation, therefore, gives a good approximation to such a line of convective clouds. Since the real atmosphere is 3D, further 3D cloud-resolving simulations are needed to address aerosol-precipitation interactions."
2967978,21349,11104,Remote sensors for and sensing of urban areas: Current state and next decade,2016,"The applications of remote sensing technology have been focused on environmental issues and natural resources. Coarse- and medium-resolution optical and radar imagery has limited usage in urban areas. At the turn of the 21st century, we have witnessed great advances in remote sensing and imaging science. Commercial satellites acquire imagery at a spatial resolution previously only possible to aerial platforms, but these satellites have advantages over aerial imageries including their capacity for synoptic coverage, inherently digital format, short revisit time, and capability to produce stereo image pairs conveniently for high-accuracy 3D mapping thanks to their flexible pointing mechanism. Hyperspectral imaging affords the potential for detailed identification of materials and better estimates of their abundance in the Earth's surface, enabling the use of remote sensing data collection to replace data collection that was formerly limited to laboratory testing or expensive field surveys. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) technology can provide high-accuracy height and other geometric information for urban structures and vegetation. In addition, radar technology has been re-inventing itself since the 1990s, due largely to the increase of spaceborne radar programs. These technologies are not isolated at all. In fact, their integrated uses with more established aerial photography and multispectral remote sensing techniques have been the main stream of current remote sensing research and applications. With the advent of the new sensor technology, the reinvention of “old” technology, and more capable computational techniques, the field of remote sensing and Earth observation is rapidly gaining, or regaining, interest in the geospatial technology community, governments, industries and the general public. The integration of the internet technology with remote sensing imaging science and GIS have led to the emergence of geo-referenced information over the web, such as Google Earth and Virtual Globe. These new geo-referenced “worlds”, in conjunction with GPS, mobile mapping, and modern telecommunication technologies, have sparked much interest in the public for remote sensing and imaging science (Weng, 2012). Within this context, urban remote sensing has become a new frontier in geospatial technology. This trend has been demonstrated by rapidly increasing publications on the topic and its widespread applications."
2034417,21349,11104,Monitoring Growth Status of Spring Wheat in Rainfed Agriculture Area in Loess Plateau with Hyperspectral Reflectance Data at Canopy and Leaf Level,2008,"From 2006 to 2007, two experiments were carried out to find out the spring wheat canopy and leaf spectral characters and the growth status non-destructively monitoring. The results are following: Firstly, that the spectral differences are clear for the canopy and leaves of spr-wheat under different density levels, and the canopy spectral reflectance are gradually getting smaller in the visible region and bigger in the near infrared region along with density level increasing at jointing, booting, heading and filling stage. The difference of the spectral reflectance of the leaf from the top on the main stem is little in the visible region and great in the near infrared region at nutrition grown stage; Secondly, In the different growth stage, the hyperspectral reflectance of the canopy level and the leaf level are different, and that of the canopy is highest at jointing stage and lowest at ripening stage in the visible region and in the shortwave and the spectral variation trend is similar, meanwhile, that is highest at flowering~filling stage in the near infrared region. The green peak disappeared at ripening stage. On the contrary, the leaf hyperspectral reflectance is highest at jointing stage than other stage in the near infrared region, and the reflectance in green region is falling at ripening stage. Thirdly, Correlation between spr-wheat variable and canopy and leaf reflectance were analyzed, The results revealed that wheat variables showed positive correlation with reflectance at near-infrared bands and negative at visible wavelength range. Five variables: The leaf area indices (LAI), the above ground fresh biomass (FW), above ground dry biomass (DW), plant height (PH) and chlorophyll showed very similar patterns potentially due to high correlation among three spr-wheat variables. The high correlation coefficient between reflectance at waveband 760-1100 nm (near-infrared) and 670-690 nm (red) with spr-wheat species variables indicated that reflectance at these wavebands might be important for monitoring spr-wheat growth status .Additionally, LAI,AFB, ADB, PH and chlorophyll are significantly correlative to the spectral indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI ), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI) ,difference vegetation index (DVI) and perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). and the relationship of PVI with plant height and above FW is the best (R=0.653,P<0.01;r=0.748,P<0.01), and the LAI have the best relationship with DVI (r=0.694,P<0.01) and the relativity are the relationship between the lambda red and the chlorophyll is the best (r=957,P<0.01), the slope of red edge (D lambda red ) and plant height (PH) are good correlation. This indicated that some right spectral variables would be used to estimate the LAI, AFB, ADB the PH and chlorophyll for spr-wheat."
1983878,21349,11104,NASA Science Serving Society: Improving Capabilities for Fire Characterization to Effect Reduction in Disaster Losses,2008,"In 2007, the United States experienced one of the most severe fire seasons on record with 110,237 fires (wildfires, prescribed, and management fires) burning 12,899,948 acres of land [1]. The suppression and damage costs of those fires exceeded one-billion dollars (US). Fires have wide ranging implications for ecological composition, climatic impacts, soil stability, economic and personal loss. U.S. wildfire management agencies are tasked with coordinating and fighting these conflagrations from the ground and air, at great risk to those crews and personnel on the front lines. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service (USFS) have teamed to explore innovative capabilities for observations of fire events, with the goal to improve the temporal resolution and information content of remotely sensed information to effect a more rapid disaster decision process. New technologies, derived from NASA science capabilities, have been developed, demonstrated and are currently being implemented in the national fire management system. In 2007, the partnership demonstrated new airborne thermal and multispectral sensor systems, innovative Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV) platform operations, and a real-time decision support system and integrated data elements to facilitate a rapid fire collaborative decision environment to be used by national managers, Incident Command Centers, and field personnel. These capabilities were demonstrated during the western US fire season in summer 2007, and further integrated into the wildfire management structure during the devastating southern California firestorms of late October, 2007. This paper details the wildfire multi-agency (NASA, USDA-FS, and NIFC) partnership, technology development, demonstration, real-life application, and capabilities infusion plan that occurred in 2007 during major wildfire events in the US. The capabilities for delivering real-time disaster- related information, and sharing such, unencumbered, among a distributed community, will and can have a significant impact in reducing the severity of both natural and man-made disasters, thereby reducing the potential for loss of ecosystems, resources, property, life and reducing management and suppression costs."

At that time, the challenging developments on both sides, the advanced high- resolution multi-mode SAR instrument on the one hand and the corresponding sophisticated TerraSAR-X ground segment on the other hand will prove correct interaction and functioning. Screening and processing of the SAR data is the task of the DLR developed TerraSAR Multi Mode SAR Processor TMSP. Preceded by data reception, transcription including decryption and followed by archiving, cataloguing and product delivery, processing of the data by the TMSP is the central part of the SAR data workflow implemented in the Payload Ground Segment PGS. Space and ground segment have been subject to intense complete system testing on ground. Here, the compatibility of SAR instrument commanding, SAR instrument operations and subsequent SAR data processing has been successfully proven for the various acquisition modes of the sensor. Compliance of specified and measured product performance has been investigated as far as possible utilizing simulated point target SAR data. However, the real challenge will be the screening and SAR processing of TerraSAR-X data acquired in orbit and linked down to the receiving station. Therefore, the complete reception and processing chain will be properly tuned and adjusted to the properties of the received TerraSAR-X payload data. The TMSP algorithms have to be configured, e.g. thresholds for calibration pulse analysis, estimation window sizes for SAR data analysis, parameterization of estimation algorithms. Also the configuration of product variants with respect to resolution and radiometric quality will be checked and refined. This paper presents the very first experiences in reception, transcription, screening and processing of TerraSAR-X data with respect to performance, throughput and quality. During the TMSP checkout phase the compatibility of instrument commanding and SAR processing have to be verified and the accordance of SAR performance prediction and the obtained product performance and quality have to be investigated. First characteristics of the SAR data with respect to raw data statistics, calibration pulse analysis and Doppler centroid measurements will be shown. As far as available examples of SAR image products featuring the different image modes, Stripmap, ScanSAR and Spotlight at different incidence angles and polarizations will be displayed and a first estimate of product performance parameters will be given."
1955684,21349,11104,Mapping rural savanna woodlands in malawi: a comparison of maximum likelihood and fuzzy classifiers.,2007,"Changes in land cover system represent a key variable in managing and understanding the environment, as well as driving many environmental assessment mechanisms such as hydrological models for large river basins water budgeting. Remote sensing can provide information on the spatial pattern of land cover features, but analysis and classification of such imagery primarily suffers from the problem of class mixing within pixels. To reflect the actual land cover conditions rigorously and well defined, statistical algorithms have to 'bridge the gap' between legend requirements and the input satellite imagery. While studies have been done using maximum likelihood and fuzzy classifiers in forestry, urban planning and savannah woodlands, appropriate methods to map land cover distributions in savanna woodlands associated with rural settlements are yet scarce. The distribution of savanna woodlands, rural residential areas (especially grass-thatched housing) and cultivated/grazing areas within the Shire River catchment in Malawi, represent classes which have similar spectral signatures (especially during the dry season). They occur in similar environments and are often in adjacent or mixed stands. Two classification methods i.e. purely using a maximum likelihood classification and when improving this classification using a contextual fuzzy convolution filter were assessed to map land cover dynamics of the Shire River catchment using Landsat 7 ETM+. With respect to classification methodologies and the ability to correctly identify land cover features, accuracies (before and after applying the filter) were compared and tested for the catchment's hydrological modelling. Spatial characteristics of the catchment, digital elevation data, precipitation and the Landsat mapped land cover data were derived and exported into a geographic information system (GIS) to provide thematic data layers from which to delineate hydrologic response units (HRUs). Eight detailed land cover classes were mapped for the Shire River catchment. The hierarchical legend structure determined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) was used to label land cover variables. The purely maximum likelihood statistical classifier accurately mapped individual classes in more detail which could not be discriminated using fuzzy convolution filter. The spatial scale for land cover parameterization can play a significant role in how specific land surface hydrological processes are simulated."
2340997,21349,11104,Application of satellite observations to manage natural disasters in the Lake Victoria Basin,2009,"Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the Eastern part of Africa is a vital natural resource for the economic well being and prosperity of over 30 million people located in riparian regions of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It covers a large area of about 68, 870 km 2  and produces a GDP of about US $30 billion per year. The region is also very much prone to natural disasters such as severe floods during heavy precipitation periods in the Eastern part of Africa. In addition to floods, the precipitation also produces large infestations of mosquito larvae due to the standing water in many areas. This further causes multiple vector borne diseases such as Malaria, Rift Valley Fever and more. These problems are of serious concern and require active and aggressive surveillance and management to minimize the loss of human and animal lives and property damage. Satellite imagery and observations along with the in situ measurements provide a great tool to analyze and study this area and inform the policy makers to make calculated policy decisions which are beneficial to the environment. Recently, NASA and USAID have joined forces with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) located in Nairobi, Kenya to utilize multiple NASA sensors such as TRMM, SRTM and MODIS to develop flood potential maps for the Lake Victoria Basin. The idea is to generate a flood forecasts and remote sensing data has proven extremely valuable for identifying the location, extent, and severity of these events. However, despite extraordinary efforts on the part of remote sensing data providers to rapidly deliver such maps, there is typically a delay of several days or even weeks from the onset of flooding until such maps are available to the disaster management community. This paper summarizes efforts at NASA to address this problem through development of an integrated and automated process of a) flood detection b) flood forecasting, c) satellite data acquisition, d) rapid flood mapping and distribution, and e) validation of flood forecasting and detection products."
1828780,21349,11104,Mapping Forest Types using Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Methods,2008,"As climate change becomes more critical in the future, having access to accurate maps of forest types and conditions will allow climate modelers to more accurately predict the carbon sequestration capacity of forested landscapes. Remote sensing tools make mapping of forest type and conditions possible. The remote sensing team members of the Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) program mapped the ECSU campus using both Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data (acquired 6/12/99) and aerial photographic data (acquired from NC OneMap, http://www.nconemap.com/). NC OneMap is a public resource for North Carolina geospatial data. Aerial photographic data was used to distinguish the different features indicated in the Landsat ETM+ image. Both remote sensing data sets were calibrated using a variety of field verification (ground truth) measurements acquired during summer 2006 session. This paper presents the final product, a land cover map of the campus, produced using unsupervised classification methods provided by MultiSpec. MultiSpec is data analysis and image processing software and was used to evaluate the ETM+ data. The ETM+ data provided multispectral data at 30 m spatial resolution, while the aerial photography provided hyperspatial data. The combination of the two sensors provided complimentary data allowing identification and mapping of dominant land cover types, including forest types, non-forest vegetation, and categories of development (parking lots, roadways, buildings, campus landmarks, etc.), not possible using either sensor separately. Mapping of the distribution of forest species assemblages (hardwoods, softwoods, and mixtures of the two) was also possible. Field methods included the identification of dominant forest species, forest canopy height, tree age, and relative state-of-health of selected tree species. Tree cores provided insight into changing growth patterns over the past century. The use of these remote sensing methods facilitated the production of accurate and up-to-date mapping of the ECSU campus not possible using other cartographic methods."
1777016,21349,11104,First results of ground moving target analysis in TerraSAR-X data,2007,"Summary form only given. The advanced high-resolution German SAR satellite TerraSAR-X is scheduled to be launched at the end of May 2007. Due to its daylight and weather independent applicability in combination with a large spatial coverage and a short acquisition time, SAR has become a promising tool for traffic monitoring in recent years. Ground moving target indication (GMTI) techniques shall be applied to TerraSAR-X data in order to demonstrate the capability of a space borne SAR sensor to monitor traffic flows on highways. A series of GMTI experiments were to be carried out during the commissioning phase of the TerraSAR-X satellite. In first trials, cars, which are equipped with special radar reflectors and GPS receivers, were to be used as moving target references that are imaged in TerraSAR-X data takes. In a follow on experiment, arbitrary cars on motorways were to be imaged simultaneously by TerraSAR-X and by an airborne high-resolution camera. Car tracks extracted from the series of the optical images shall serve as a reference for the evaluation of the TerraSAR-X moving target data in this case. The paper presents first results of the data evaluation. An experimental GMTI processing system is used to detect and measure moving targets in both single-channel and dual-channeldata. The dual-channel data, which enable the application of well established GMTI methods like the along-track interferometry (ATI) or displaced phase centre array (DPCA) techniques, are acquired either in the so-called aperture switching mode with virtual multiple receiving channels or in the dual-receive antenna (DRA) mode with physically separated receiving channels. The paper reports on the analysis of the first experimental GMTI data by using different detection and measurement strategies. This includes the adapted processing of the SAR raw data with respect to the moving target signals, the incorporation of GIS data in the detection and measurement process and the application of different detectors for across- and along-track velocity components of the moving cars. The quality of the data is thoroughly analyzed and conclusions are drawn for the development and the performance of a fully automatic GMTI processing system for TerraSAR-X. Furthermore, an outlook on the planned experiments is given."
2363068,21349,11104,An image fusion method based on object-oriented image classification,2005,"Image fusion at pixel level without precise registration always causes pseudo colors and other problem. Classification-based fusion scheme can effectively eliminate the false color at the edge of objective. However, the traditional per-pixel classification results in the well-known salt and pepper effect. The only way to smooth the image is to use filters, while impacted on the result of fusion. This paper proposes a method consist of a sequential application of segmentation, classification and fusion techniques. First, the image was multi-resolutely segmented into homogenous areas, and classified it by using the membership functions classifier and additional empirical rules. Subsequently, according to the restriction of the precise classification result, adjusting the multi-spectral image then achieved the fusion by using HSV color transformation. Finally, after compared the statistical properties of the fusion result by different methods, the proposed method showed satisfied result. I. INTRODUCTION With the appearance of plentiful kinds of remote sensing imagery, fusion of satellite images of different spatial resolutions play an important role. Via image fusion, we can obtain more information than can be derived from single kind of image. Pohl prompted that according to the stage which image fusion is performed, there are pixel, feature and decision level. Image fusion at pixel level always was effected by the accuracy of registration, the number of mixed pixel and other factors. The pixel in high-resolution satellite image is smaller sizes and combined with fewer spectral bands that cause greater spectral variation within a class and a greater degree of shadow. Hence, color break and pseudo colors often occur at the edge of object and shadow which fusing the high-resolution image only at pixel levels. During the high-resolution image fusion, for eliminating color break and pseudo colors, using its classification image as the prior knowledge and restricting the fusion area can take full advantage of spectral information from multi-spectral bands and texture information come from pan band to realize the image fusion. It's a method of image fusion that performing at pixel level and integrate with feature level fusion. In this way, phenomenon of pseudo colors can be avoided. In this paper, we propose an image fusion method based on object-oriented classification. Via image segmentation, feature extraction and image fusion based on object-oriented classification, the fusion image can be achieved. In this method, object-oriented classification more appropriate for high-resolution image to get accuracy classification result and overcoming the limit of per-pixel image analyses. Because much information is acquired in the relationship between adjacent pixels, including texture and shape information, which allows for identification of individual objects as oppose to single pixels"
2424153,21349,11104,Effect of radar frequency on waterline mapping from airborne SAR image in the intertidal zone,2005,"Discrepancy of waterline extracted from L- and P-band airborne SAR images was investigated in the intertidal zone through the field measurements and theory of SAR imaging mechanism. In the intertidal zone which has low slope, the Bragg waves resonant with each radar frequency can reside in different depth of surf zone, resulting in the boundary between water and land can be mapped differently in SAR images. I. INTRODUCTION Most large modern cities are located in coastal zones. It is essential to map and monitor changes in waterlines in a timely. Airborne or space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image provide an efficient aid to monitor and map the waterlines due to high resolution synoptic views of water extent. The west and south coast of the Korean Peninsula is famous for its large tidal range and vast tidal flats. Continuous observation of waterline is highly required in these areas. The extraction of waterlines from SAR images has been studied (1-5). Most of these studies were based on gray level thresholding, segmentation or tracing along the boundary between land and water directly shown in SAR images. However, images of waterlines generated by SAR suffer from a number of speckle effect and meteorological conditions. The return from the wind roughened and wave modulated water can frequently equal or exceed the return from a nearby land area, resulting in inadequate contrast for unambiguous separation. Furthermore, waterline itself estimated from SAR images can vary depending on the sea surface states. Radar frequency or wavelength is important parameter in ocean SAR imaging. Different radar frequency of signal will interact with different length of ocean waves - Bragg scattering (6-8). In the coastal region, the water depth is shallow and rapidly changing, and surface waves can feel the bottom, causing breaking waves. The interaction of these breaking waves with radar signals is extremely complex and very difficult to model. The means by which waves break depends on the nature of the bottom and the characteristics of the wave. For very mildly sloping beaches like tidal flat, typically the waves are spilling breakers - numerous waves occur within the surf zone and these waves begin to lose their energy through friction with the bottom (9). In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of (breaking) surface waves in surf zone in order to explain the discrepancy of waterlines extracted from multiple frequency SAR data in intertidal zone."
1799662,21349,11104,A Sensor Web Simulator for Design of New Earth Science Observing Systems,2008,"A strategic goal of NASA's Science Mission Directorate is the development of highly advanced global Earth observing systems to help monitor and predict key elements of the Earth's ocean-atmosphere system. A new concept now being considered is the sensor web, which would allow collaborative measurements to be made by linking together various spaced-based and in situ observations along with output from numerical models. A underlying sophisticated communications fabric would enable rapid, seamless interaction across observing platforms and between observations and Earth system models. For weather forecasting applications, we envision a future architecture in which Earth observing systems are coupled with many different atmospheric, chemical, and oceanographic models and data assimilation systems such that our ability to monitor, understand, and predict the evolution of rapidly evolving, transient, or variable features in the atmosphere are better understood. In theory, tasking the observing system to collect data at specific locations in space and time could produce notable gains in predictive skill. In 2006 our team was awarded funding from NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) to design and build an end-to- end sensor web simulator (SWS) based upon the proposed architecture that would objectively assess the scientific value of a fully functional model-driven meteorological sensor web. The effort is based upon two ESTO-funded studies that have yielded a next-generation weather observing system architecture and a preliminary SWS software architecture developed in 2003. Simulation is essential: investing in the design and implementation of such a complex observing system could be potentially costly and almost certainly involve significant risk. The SWS will help provide information systems engineers and Earth scientists with the ability to define and model candidate designs, and to quantitatively measure predictive forecast skill improvements. We will report on our efforts to develop a prototype simulator for a weather forecasting application, and present preliminary results in which the steps of the simulator were manually executed."
1760190,21349,11104,Harnessing systems engineering methodology in using earth science research data for real applications,2004,"For the last three decades, Earth science remote sensing technologies have been providing an enormous amount of useful data and information serving to broaden our understanding of the home planet as a system. NASA's Earth science program has deployed about 18 complex satellites and is in the process of defining and launching multiple observing systems in this decade. At the same time, the European Community and many other countries such as Russia, France, India, Japan, and China have also significantly contributed to Earth science research. To date, the majority of such efforts have concentrated on expanding our scientific understanding of the multiple nonlinear and chaotic processes of Earth's behavior. In recent years, legislators and stakeholders have put serious pressure on the science community to devote more attention to making use of scientific results for societal benefit. For instance, there are a number of areas such as energy forecasting, aviation safety, agricultural efficiency, disaster management, air quality and public health that can directly take advantage of Earth science results to analyze and predict large scale problems and conditions. This is becoming even more important now that we live in a global economy interconnected via the internet and transportation systems; regional environmental conditions can have far reaching impact across continental boundaries. These factors dictate requirements for global data that can help us assess and control the devastating problems of famine, water resources, wildfires, human health and more. To do this requires a serious, organized, and systematic approach that transfers fundamental research products to the applied sciences domain. This paper presents a systems engineering and management process that can effectively make such transfer of data to the user community. Examples are presented on how the above decision making framework can help in solving critical problems such as the spread of vector borne diseases, forecasts of harmful algal blooms as well as forest fires and wildfires, and the intercontinental transport of dust storms and pollution"
2333886,21349,11104,Identification of inland fresh water wetland using SAR and ETM+ data,2007,"The main aim of this paper was to explore the potential of SAR data, in combination with optical remote sensing data, in identifying inland fresh water wetland from crop, especially rice paddy. The test area is a part of Hongze Lake, the fourth biggest fresh water lake in China. It is one of important wetlands for migratory birds in China. Due to unreasonable exploitation of wetland resources, the lake is facing a great loss of wetland. In Hongze lake watershed, Jiangsu Provincial Sihong Hongze Lake wetland ecological reserve was established for the preserve of wetland ecosystem and rare species in the watershed. In the processing of the dataset, clustering algorithm ISODATA was employed firstly to generate initial classification results for sample selection. Then, 1500 samples were taken in total by using stratified random sampling. These samples were superimposed on the screen on top of rectified aerial images. The land cover class at each point was determined based on field investigation and visual interpretation. 900 samples of them were for training and the other for the assessment of classification accuracy. Attributes of samples such as the digital number values of six bands of ETM+( TM1-5, 7), texture, DEM and 4 components of principal components analysis of six bands of ETM + data, were fed into the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm for the generation of knowledge rules. Because the training observations were evenly distributed among classes, the class assignment at each terminal node was determined by the majority of per-class observations at that node. Then, decision tree classifier was applied to the imagery of ETM+ for the classification of landuse/cover in the whole study area. RADARSAT SAR C-band was classified into four classes: lowest backscatter, low backscatter, medium and high backscatter. The results from two data sources were combined by using rules. The results showed that the combination of the SAR data and the optical remotely sensed data have achieved the highest classification accuracy (92.3% of total classification accuracy). The results also confirmed the value of classification tree in the identification of fresh water wetland. It was illustrated that radar data was a good complementary data source for the identification of wetland."
1799452,21349,11104,Disaster monitoring and environmental alert in Taiwan by repeat-pass spaceborne SAR,2007,"The prevailing complex geological and ecological conditions of Taiwan have drawn considerable attention from various geo-ecological communities because of their vulnerability to produce various natural hazards at different scales. Located in the tropical/subtropical zone of the Pacific Rim, its ecological and rugged mountainous properties are environmentally sensitive making monitoring and observations especially difficult because of the high population density. For example, in terms of natural hazard mitigation tectonically active regions are used for analyzing the cause of abundant risk events, such as earthquakes, landslides and land subsidence. In fact Taiwan is well suited as a test site for studying those geologically disastrous processes. Implementing novel techniques of space remote sensing has proved to be an effective means in recent years for greatly improving our understanding of these phenomena. In this paper we report on the monitoring of such events using multi-modal polarimetric and/or interferometric SAR images at C and L band from ERS, JERS-1, RADARSAT-1, ENVISAT, and from the recent ALOS satellite. For crustal and surface deformation, we used radar image pairs with long temporal baselines and large areas of coverage for investigating deformation over Western Taiwan. Pre-seismic and co-seismic deformation patterns are spatial-temporally analyzed. The other topic deals with the coastline changes observed from a sequence of ERS-1/2 SAR images within the years of 1996 to 2005. Waterlines were extracted using multi-scale procedures of edge detection and were corrected with tidal motion data. Substantial analyses were carried out in conjunction with ground surveys and lidar mapping. The topographic feature changes due to large scale landslides triggered by torrential rains were also monitored. In addition, the SAR interferograms were used to analyze the deposition changes along the riverbeds and riverbanks for short-intervals using optimal baselines. Summary and remarks on the implementation of such multi-modal polarimetric and/or interferometric SAR imagery for environmental monitoring are provided."
1731667,21349,11104,EnMAP A Hyperspectral Sensor for Environmental Mapping and Analysis,2006,"The environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP) is a joint response of German Earth observation research institutions, value-adding (VA) resellers and space industry to the increasing demand on accurate, quantitative information about the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems. With its hyperspectral capabilities covering the visible, near- and short-wave infrared wavelengths, EnMAP will provide high quality, standardized, and consistent data on a timely and frequent basis. Its primary focus will be on the considerable improvement of already standardized products and the development of new quantitative and subsequently highly informative data and its derivatives. Only an imaging spectrometer, such as the EnMAP, can resolve and detect biophysical, biochemical, and geochemical variables in distinct detail. This will tremendously increase our understanding of coupled biospheric and geospheric processes and thus, enable the management and ensure the sustainability of our vital resources. After a competitive and successfully accomplished phase A, EnMAP has been approved by the German Aerospace Agency in the beginning of 2006. The instrument performance allows for a detailed monitoring, characterisation and parameter extraction of vegetation targets, rock/soils, and inland and coastal waters on a global scale. By the scientific lead of the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) and the industrial prime ship of Kayser-Threde, the ongoing planning aims towards an internationalisation of the mission approach. The EnMAP instrument provides information based on 218 contiguous spectral bands in the wavelength range from 420 nm to 2450 nm. It is characterized by a SNR of > 500:1 in the VNIR and >150:1 in the SWIR range at a ground resolution of 30 m times 30 m. A national and international broad science and application community can draw from an extensive and highly resolved pool of information, supporting the modeling and optimization process on their results. Operation of an airborne system (ARES - a joint venture of DLR and GFZ), starting in 2006, and the evolution of data handling and extraction procedures will further support this process."
775084,21349,11104,Accurate geometric references from low B/H stereoscopic airbone acquisition,2007,"Since early 1999, the CNES has worked on defining and equipping supersites for its needs in image quality assessment. Various criteria guided the definition of this supersite involving the characteristics of high resolution earth observation satellites and the image quality assessment methods. The main goal of this work is to have high resolution geometric references in order to calibrate any high resolution spatial sensor. The accuracy of sensor calibration that can be obtained using image matching techniques depends both on planimetric and altimetric accuracy of the reference. In order to produce this kind of references, very high resolution aerial images are used (10 cm ground sampling distance). Two very high resolution cameras fly over several sites in order to produce stereoscopic images with narrow angular fields of view. This original acquisition system allows us to produce a high resolution 3D reference with similar images containing no shadows effects. Moreover, thanks to this system, the overlap between a couple of images is nearly 100% if the stereoscopic angle is low. One of the key factors of the quality of the 3D reconstruction is the value of the stereoscopic angle used. This paper shows that low stereoscopic angles are sufficient to build the elevation model including superstructures. This characteristic is the determining factor to make spatial native stereoscopy. The essential condition to compute an high accurate elevation model with the aerial data is to control the geometrical model of all the images. A lack of knowledge of the geometrical model could be interpreted as a default of altitude of the scene (or a part of the scene). Therefore to build the digital surface model (DSM), the planimetry is first controlled through particularly accurate aerotriangulation based on lot of tie points and also, if available, based on ground control points measured with high accuracy through a GPS measurement campaign. The accurate geometry of all the images is computed with a complete aerotriangulation. Once the geometrical models are accurately known, a high resolution DSM can be created using a dense correlation process between images couples with a low stereoscopic angle. The aerotriangulation and the DSM allow us to have a high resolution geometric reference that ensures both planimetric and altimetric accuracy which are key factors for the geometric quality of a spatial sensor calibration. This kind of reference will be used to calibrate a spatial sensor like Pleiades."

1869480,21349,11104,A CHRIS triplet for forest attributes,2007,"The Evaluation and Validation of CHRIS for National Forests Project (EVC) was selected by ESA's science team for their hyperspectral sensor,CHRIS as part of the PROBA mission. On September 2 nd  to 4 th , 2006, a triplet acquisition over the Greater Victoria Watershed District (GVWD), taken in Mode-1, has provided us with 15 look angles in three consecutive days. The Minimum Zenith Angles (MZA) for each date were +20deg, -2deg and -23deg respectively, each of which has five nominal Fly-by Zenith Angles (FZA) of plusmn55deg, plusmn36deg and 0deg. This triplet has been processed and analyzed in order to assess the utility of CHRIS data for mapping forest parameters. Pre-processing is important in order to produce hyperspectral and directional data that is consistent spatially, spectrally, and directionally. Both the inherent horizontal and vertical noise have been reduced using the improved processes proposed by DIELMO 3D [1]. The GVWD has significant topographic relief that required a geometric correction based on a parametric approach [2], as implemented in PCI's Orthoengine. ATCOR 3 was used for the atmospheric correction. Further calibration was required, in which the atmospherically corrected data were matched to spectral ground data, measured during the overpass at angles matching the CHRIS images. This field calibration required the development of a simple goniometer and improved understanding of the true geometry of CHRIS image acquisitions, relative to observations made on the ground. A goal was to derive CHRIS algorithms for producing accurate estimates of forest parameters such as conifer forest species and biomass. The spectral information content provided information on the biochemistry of the forest canopy, while the multi-angle imagery gave information on the structural components of the forest canopy [3]. It has been shown that using multi-angle imagery can improve classification results of forest species by 8%, compared to the 80.3% classification accuracy with only the nadir angles for CHRIS mode 4 data [4]. The triplet dataset offers improvements to our study of BRDF over this earlier study. The image triplet was acquired in mode 1, which provides more spectral bands; the images were acquired in a short time interval with very similar sun angles."
419135,21349,11104,Assimilation of remote sensing data to monitor the terrestrial carbon cycle: The carbon observatory of geoland,2004,"The existing land data assimilation projects (NLDAS, GLDAS, ELDAS) do not include interactive vegetation land surface models, which limits the use of remote sensing data. The analysed variable in LDAS is soil moisture, only, and there is a need to account for vegetation biomass to monitor the biosphere vegetation-atmosphere CO 2  exchange. The geoland Integrated Project (2004-2007) co-funded by the European Commission, aims at addressing European and global environment issues, based on the use of remote sensing data. The carbon observatory of geoland, hereinafter referred to as geoland/Carbon, provides a pre-operational global carbon accounting system, dealing with the impact of weather and climate variability on ecosystems fluxes and carbon stocks, on daily to seasonal and inter-annual time scales. The solution chosen in geoland/Carbon is to merge the LDAS approach and the interactive vegetation models, by making two communities work together: the meteorologists involved in ELDAS and the carbon modellers. In particular, we investigate the relationship between weather and climate variability and terrestrial CO 2  fluxes. The integration of in situ meteorological measurements and different satellite remote sensing sources of information are made by using assimilation techniques. In order to integrate the existing approaches and to deliver an assessment based on independent modelling results, two land surface models are used: 1) an operational scheme (ECMWF) used in numerical weather forecast models, modified to describe an interactive vegetation (based on ISBA-A-gs, Meteo-France); 2) a carbon-water-energy land surface scheme, fitted with carbon dynamics in biomass and soil pools, and with ecosystem dynamics (LSCE). The assimilation system can be run at the global scale with both carbon models. The assimilated output fields are checked against global observations of different nature, such as eddy covariance networks, long term ecological time series (e.g. IGBP transects), forest and soil carbon inventories, or satellite products that were not used at first in the assimilation procedure. At the end of this project, ECMWF is able to propose a single near-operational system based on components of the two approaches"
1553357,21349,11104,"Mapping of seagrass and other benthic habitats in Bolinao, Pangasinan using Worldview-2 satellite image",2013,"The objective of this research is to determine the suitability of Worldview-2 high resolution multispectral data in classifying and mapping benthic habitats, specifically seagrass. Worldview-2 offers an increased number of spectral bands for high-resolution image, from the traditional 4bands to 8 bands. It boasts of the ability to enhance mapping and monitoring of benthic habitats with the addition of the Coastal Band. This was investigated in this research using a Worldview-2 image of Bolinao, Pangasinan acquired on March 2010. The study site, Bolinao, has the highest single concentration of seagrass in the northern part of the Philippines. To achieve more accurate results, geometric, atmospheric and water column corrections were applied to the images. For geometric correction, a Differential Global Positioning System Topcon Hiper Ga model receiver was used to obtain highly accurate ground control points. Atmospheric correction was performed in ENVI using the Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis (FLAASH) model. Three water column correction models were applied and compared in this research, Lyzenga's Optical Model, Stumpf's Ratio Model and Simple Radiative Transfer Model. A spectral library was created using in situ reflected spectral radiances on both submerged and emerged vegetation to aid in image classification. Different benthic covers, seagrass, sand, corals and rocks are significantly separable spectrally based on spectral signatures obtained on field using a USB 4000 Fiber Optic Spectrometer. Maximum likelihood supervised classification in ENVI 4.8 is utilized for mapping. Using Worldview 2's coastal, green, yellow and red bands and applying the Simple Radiative Transfer Model produced the highest overall accuracy (88.3%) among the classification results. Using the same bands, Stumpf's Ratio Model produced 87.84% overall accuracy while Lyzenga's optical model achieved 75.54%. Moran's I spatial autocorrelation was implemented to increase the classification accuracy. Using lag 1 slightly increased Stumpf's Model's overall accuracy, from 87.84% to 88.08% while using lags 5 and 10 decreased the overall accuracy with 83.91% and 84.25% respectively."
655569,21349,11104,Saliency and salient region detection in SAR polarimetry,2005,"Effective feature extraction is the basis of every approach to automated image analysis. An important class of extraction operators, point and region of interest detectors, has not yet been developed for SAR Polarimetry. This paper describes a region of interest operator designed to identify distinctive regions in a scale invariant fashion. The work presented includes a novel definition of image entropy, in the information theoretical sense, for polarimetric SAR image content, as well as a rigorous statistical analysis of the operators scale selection mechanism. This analysis establishes the ability to identify a region irrespec- tive of its size. The results presented include the application of the operator to real data and demonstrations of the operators scale invariance. I. INTRODUCTION Feature extractors, for instance edge detectors, act as con- centrators of information that emphasise certain relevant prop- erties of an image and suppress noise and other types of irrele- vant information. This process is essential to algorithms which aim to provide high level, semantic interpretations of image content. This is partly due to the fact that such algorithms are easier to formulate if certain types of information are available, but also because images contain such a wealth of information that an exhaustive analysis is usually infeasible. A number of feature extraction operators have been proposed in the context of polarimetric SAR data. Ideally, these operators are designed to take the statistical properties of SAR images into account. Examples include polarimetric edge detectors (1) and texture descriptors (2). An important class of operators, point of interest and region of interest (ROI) detectors, has not yet been developed for SAR remote sensing data. ROI operators identify distinctive, prominent or highly informative patches in an image, and are employed to achieve sparse but succinct representations of complex image data. A wide range of problems in the automated analysis of image data can be formulated as search problems, where there is a need to identify certain objects or segments of a scene. In these types of problem, an operator which reduces an entire image to a comparatively small collection of patches, which are localised and have a known size, can greatly reduce the size of the search space to be considered."
2199378,21349,11104,Unmixing the directional reflectances of AVHRR sub-pixel landcovers,1997,"Recent progress in canopy bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model inversions has allowed accurate estimates of vegetation biophysical characteristics from remotely sensed multi-angle optical data. Since most current BRDF inversion methods utilize one-dimensional (1D) models, surface homogeneity within an image pixel is implied. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is one of the few spaceborne sensors capable of acquiring radiometric data over the range of view angles required for BRDF inversions. However, its relatively coarse spatial resolution often results in measurements of mixed landcovers, and thus the data may not be ideal for BRDF inversions. The authors present a three-step spectral unmixing method for retrieving AVHRR sub-pixel directional reflectances in regions of high spatial heterogeneity. The reflectances of individual vegetation types are deconvolved using co-located Landsat TM and AVHRR data. The three major steps in the model include: (1) unmixing of vegetation endmember concentrations in TM imagery; (2) correction of dissimilar shadow fractions between TM and AVHRR data; and (3) unmixing of AVHRR sub-pixel reflectances of vegetation types for any Sun-sensor geometry. The authors tested the method using simulated TM and AVHRR data. A savannah landscape simulation, comprised of a canopy radiative transfer model and a crown geometric-optical model was used to create images containing mixed pixels of tree, grass, and shade endmembers. TM and AVHRR spectral response functions, viewing geometrics, and off-nadir pixel shape calculations were incorporated into the simulations. Following the successful testing of the unmixing method on error-free simulations, random noise representing atmospheric perturbations and co-registration inaccuracies was added to the data. The method is stable when errors resulting from either the first unmixing step or image co-registration inaccuracies are introduced. Potential errors in the AVHRR data may result in inaccurately retrieved reflectances if the image scene contains a spatially homogeneous mix of landcovers. A method for detecting and mitigating this problem is presented."
1937166,21349,11104,Agro-ecological Data Aspects in Arid Zone and Role of Remote Sensing,2006,"Remote sensing data acquisition from the satellite images is very important for the scientific evaluation of land-use, monitoring changes, and to allow best management of use of the resources. Agro-ecosystems in arid lands are very important to provide the agricultural crops that can provide food for the living population on these lands. The arid lands are covering more than 30% of the total world areas (i.e. the classification of the dry-lands, are: Hyper-arid 7.5%, Arid 12.1% and semiarid 17.7% of the total world areas lands [13,049 million hectares] in consequence)[1]. The present paper will assess the agro-ecosystems in the arid zone and the effectiveness use of the remotely sensed data from satellite images. The remote sensing data showed that the agro-ecosystems in the arid zone are very susceptible to water shortages and reduction of rainfall. Further, the arid lands are characterized with the following phenomena: (1) agriculture in most arid zone countries is the main consumer of water; (2) most arid zone countries have high population growth, and rural population densities are generally much higher than overall population densities; (3) the arid zones have a surprising diversity of agro-ecological systems, with edaphically conditions that can deviate substantially from those of surrounding areas and this is due to the mosaic of changes in the water resources; (4) the surrounding of agro-ecosystems in these areas are very highly productive due to the intensive agricultural practice and the systems of comprehensive monoculture crops which in turn to establish the high productivity; (5) because of the vulnerability of the surrounding environment in the arid regions such as winds, sand storms, heat and these environmental issues can cause damages to these ecosystems and destruction and to accelerate the degradation; and (6) The human stresses in these ecosystems further encourage the further destruction of the soil, increasing salinity in the soil and further degradation and the reduction of productivity of these agricultural ecosystems. Using of spatial analysis of the GIS systems provided the important picture of the degraded ecosystems and the impact of human pressures on these ecosystems. I believe that the research which are targeted towards data spatialization and integration of remotely sensing information, in addition to meteorological data, terrestrial ecosystems data of land cover that were measured by using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (A VHRR) [2] that have of 1X1 km and other computer models will help to alleviate the handicap of sparse data to be combined to serve the human communities in supporting the better sustainable development of valuable natural resources of the earth."
2141810,21349,11104,Comparison between MARSIS & SHARAD results,2007,"MARSIS (Mars advanced Radar for subsurface and ionosphere sounding) is a low frequency nadir looking sounding radar selected by ESA as a payload of the Mars Express mission, whose primary Scientific Objective is to map the distribution of water both solid and liquid, at global scale on the Martin crust. MARSIS is the first instrument to be able to detect what lies beneath the surface of Mars (up to about 5 km). MARSIS operates with a very high fractional bandwidth: 1 MHz bandwidth allows a vertical resolution of 150 m in vacuum which corresponds to 50-100 m in the subsurface, depending on the electromagnetic wave propagation speed in the crust. The center frequency of the pulses transmitted by MARSIS can be set to 1.8 MHz, 3 MHz, 4 MHz and 5 MHz. On day side operations, it operates only in 4 MHz and 5 MHz due to the ionosphere plasma frequencies of Mars cutting of all frequencies lower than 3 MHz. All the four carrier frequencies are available for subsurface sounding on night side. The Mars Shallow Radar Sounder (SHARAD), a facility instrument provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), is embarked on board the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. SHARAD began science operations on October 3rd 2006 : it has been collected data from surface and subsurface. This instrument penetrates to roughly half a kilometer below Mars' to search for information about underground layers of ice, rock and, perhaps, melted water. SHARAD operates with a center frequency of 20 MHz and 10 MHz bandwidth. These parameters allow vertical resolution on the order of 10-20 m. The carrier frequency of 20 MHz guarantees the capability of SHARAD to operate in day side as well as in night side. Both MARSIS and SHARAD use the principle of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to achieve a fine along-track resolution. In particular,MARSIS is an un-focused SAR with best along-track resolution of 2 km; data coming from SHARAD can be processed with focusing algorithm (Chirp Scaling Algorithm), rising a best horizontal resolution of 300 m. This paper provides a comparison between MARSIS and SHARAD images in different zones of the Mars' surface. From the preliminary analysis it has been evident that MARSIS detects signals from subsurface interfaces at 3 km of depth, while the signals received by SHARAD in the same zone and at the same depth are much weaker compared with the background noise. However,SHARAD radar-grams show subsurface interfaces at 100-200 m of depth: these interesting targets can not be discriminated by MARSIS because of its coarse vertical resolution. At the same time,SHARAD data add to MARSIS data scientific information about the upper portions of the crust of Mars."
2261036,21349,11104,Oceanic Rainfall Retrievals using passive and active measurements from SeaWinds Remote Sensor,2007,"The SeaWinds sensor was launched onboard two satellite missions. The first was the QuikSCAT mission launched in mid 1999 by NASA, and the second was the ADEOS II mission launched by JAXA in late 2002. SeaWinds operates at a ku-band frequency of 13.4 GHz, and was originally designed to measure the speed and direction of the ocean surface wind vector by relating the normalized radar backscatter measurements to the near surface wind vector through a geophysical model function. In addition to the backscatter measurement capability, SeaWinds simultaneously measures the polarized radiometric emission from the surface and atmosphere, utilizing a ground signal processing algorithm known as the QuikSCAT / SeaWinds Radiometer (QRad / SRad). This paper presents an oceanic rainfall retrieval algorithm that combines the simultaneous active radar backscatter and the passive microwave brightness temperatures observed by the SeaWinds sensor. The retrieval algorithm is statistically based, and has been developed using collocated measurements from SeaWinds, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) rain rates, and the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) wind fields. The rain is retrieved on a wind vector cell (WVC) measurement grid that has a spatial resolution of 25 km. Examples of the rain estimates from SeaWinds are presented, and comparisons are made with the standard TRMM 2A12 rain data product. Validation results demonstrate that SeaWinds rain measurements are in good agreement with the independent microwave rain observations obtained from TMI. Further, by applying a threshold on the retrieved rain rates, SeaWinds rain estimates can be utilized as a rain flag. In order to evaluate the performance of the SeaWinds flag, comparisons are made with the Impact based Multidimensional Histogram (IMUDH) rain flag developed by JPL. Results emphasize the powerful rain detection capabilities of the SeaWinds retrieval algorithm. Due to its broad swath coverage, SeaWinds affords additional independent sampling of the oceanic rainfall, which may contribute to the future NASA's Precipitation Measurement Mission (PMM) objectives of improving the global sampling of oceanic rain within 3 hour windows. Also, since SeaWinds is the only sensor onboard QuikSCAT, the SeaWinds rain estimates can be used to improve the flagging of rain-contaminated oceanic wind vector retrievals. The passive-only rainfall retrieval algorithm (QRad /SRad) has been implemented by JPL as part of the level 2B science data product, and can be obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Data Archive (PO.DAAC)."
294552,21349,11104,"Generation of multi-temporal JERS-1 SAR mosaics over the Manaus-Coari-Urucu Region, Western Amazonia, Brazil",2004,"Studies conducted by Petrobras (the Brazilian national oil company) in Western Amazonia indicate a high demand for petroleum in the region. This fact encouraged Petrobras to build a pipeline that transports 60 thousand barrels of oil per day from the Urucu oil and gas province to the Solimoes terminal north of the city of Coari. This oil is then shipped to another terminal in Manaus. The water level changes between dry and wet seasons attain a difference up to 14 meters in the surroundings of Coari city. The strong seasonal character of the Amazonian climate gives rise to four distinct scenarios in the annual hydrological cycle: low water, high water, receding water, and rising water. These scenarios constitute the main reference for the definition of oil spill response planning by Petrobras. The systematic coverage of JERS-1 SAR images obtained in Western and Central Amazonia between October 1995 and November 1996 allowed the construction of mosaics contemplating these four seasonal scenarios, and therefore improving information about oil spill environmental sensitivity. Twenty-two (22) images per seasonal scenario were used to build the mosaics, which were then classified using the unsupervised semivariogram textural classifier (USTC). Cover types identified using USTC included flooded forest, upland forest and water. These four seasonal mosaics were manipulated using GIS technology to: (1) serve as a spatial framework to environmental studies, such as genetics and distribution offish species, malaria, social-economics, macrophyte distribution, water chemistry, among others; (2) design Petrobras' contingency plans and guide simulated oil spill exercises in the fluvial environment; (3) model water hydrodynamics over the flooded forest; (4) define the route of the Coari-Manaus pipeline avoiding oil sensitive and environmentally protected areas. The information derived from JERS-1 SAR data is straightforward to interpret and constitutes an operational representation in the cartographic space of oil spill sensitivity classes conceived by Petrobras."

The goals of the program are: 1) To develop high-resolution, three-dimensional mapping of the atmospheric conditions, focusing on the boundary layer, to detect and forecast severe wind, tornado, hail, ice, and flash flood hazards. 2) To create impacts-based, neighborhood-scale warnings and forecasts for a range of public and private decision-makers that result in measureable benefit for public safety and the economy. 3) To demonstrate the value of collaborative, adaptive X-band radar networks to existing and future National Weather Service sensors, products, performance metrics, and decision-making; and assess optimal combinations of observing systems The centerpiece of the Dallas Fort Worth Urban Demonstration Network will be an 8-node, boundary-layer, dual polarized, multi-Doppler X-band CASA radar network. Additional in-situ and remote sensors will enable fusion of observations from all sensors. Data products will include single and multi-radar data, vector wind, Quantitative precipitation estimation, nowcasting, and analysis and numerical weather prediction products. Research and Research to operations in the DFW Urban Demonstration Network will occur in a quasi-operational environment. New technology and products will be integrated into operational platforms for evaluation by a variety of users during real-time weather events. Users include NWS forecasters and emergency managers; users from transportation, utilities, regional airports, arenas, and the media will be added in the near future. In this way, CASA's multidisciplinary team - engineers, computer scientists, social scientists (sociologists, geographer, economist), meteorologists, hydrologists - will conduct “end-to-end” research from sensor observation, to product development and validation linked to end user decision-making, response and value."
2265989,21349,11104,Monitoring land use dynamics for ecological degradation assessment in the rim zone of North China using MODIS and Land TM data,2004,"Within North China there is a special rim zone characterized with a mixture of crop farming and herd grazing. Due to intensive land use for cropping and grazing, natural ecosystems in this semi-arid zone have been seriously destroyed in the past decades. Several strong sandstorms in recent years swept through the zone to invade into Beijing the capital of China and other big cities in North China. It has been commonly agreed that the sandstorms are the direct results of landscape ecological destroy in Northwest China, Inner Mongolia and Mongolia Plateau. The ecological degradation and desertification are the core issues concerned from both inside and outside China especially Japan and Korea. In order to monitor the ecosystem development and its dynamics in the zone and in the Northwest China Plateau for possible programs of environmental improvement, many academic efforts have been on the way toward the zone. The current study at our lab is part of the efforts in China. The objective of the study is to monitor the land use changes in last twenty years in the rim zone. Arclnfo GIS has been used as tool to establish a spatial database for the social-economic and natural conditions of the zone. Remote sensing (RS) data especially MODIS and Land TM images have been used for land use mapping. Integrating GIS with RS techniques., we analyze the land use dynamics of the zone, which has above 200 counties spreading in Qinghai, Gansu. Shaanxi. Shanxi, Hebei. Inner Mongolia.. Liaoning. Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. The zone can be divided into three sub-regions for detailed examination: the east, the middle and the west. The result indicates that farmland in the zone expands 3.12% from 1985 to 2000. while rangeland as a contrast reduces 3.44% during the period. On the other hand, the occupied area of settlements (villages and towns) increases up to 11.61%. All these imply that intensive anthropogenic activities have been the forces driving the landscape ecosystem in the zone to change dramatically in the recent decades. It is very urgent to administrate crop farming and herd grazing for a sustainable development in the zone where ecosystem has been very fragile"
2904520,21349,11104,"Multitemporal monitoring of the forest cover in Côte d'Ivoire from the 1960s to the 2000s, using Landsat satellite images",2016,"The phenomenon of deforestation is a reality in Cote d'Ivoire, which dates back to the colonial period [1]. This study aims to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of dense rainforests using remote sensing data. Many previous studies have attempted to determine the area of forest cover in Cote d'Ivoire ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Most of these studies were conducted from either aerial photographs or satellite images of low spatial resolutions such as NOAA / AVHRR [8]. However, through these studies, methods of estimates of the area of forest cover generally vary from one author to another, thus causing an inconsistency in the results [9]. Remote sensing allows a better assessment of the scope and scale of the problem of deforestation. Using multi-temporal data, one can better detect and analyze changes in the forest cover. By comparing images of previous years with recent scenes, it becomes possible to effectively measure the differences in the extent of deforestation and loss of rainforests in Cote d'Ivoire ([10] and [11]). In a first phase, the country's dense forest cover of the 1960s was determined from the digitization of existing vegetation map. In a second phase, the dense forest cover of the 1980s and 2000s were obtained by processing of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite images. First the geometric correction of the satellite images was performed. Then, series of supervised classifications based on the maximum likelihood method were done to generate maps of land cover, with overall accuracies of 90%. From these land cover maps, the class of dense forests was extracted and converted into a map layer in vector format. By crossing dense forests covers of the 1980s and 2000 with those of the 1960s, the specific characterizations of those forests were derived (Figure 1, 2, 3). The results show a dense humid forest cover of about 8.4 million ha in 1960, with the presence of large blocks. The 1980s and 2000s have dense forest cover of 2.6 million ha and 1.35 million ha, respectively (Tables 1, 2, 3). These latter periods are characterized by high loss and fragmentation of rainforests in Cote d'Ivoire. Thus, since its independence, the country has lost more than 80% of its forest cover. The results of this study show that clearing associated with industrial agriculture mainly cocoa, coffee and rubber farming as well as demographic pressure and abusive exploitation of valuable wood species for export are the main causes of deforestation in Cote d'Ivoire. This study advocates the restoration of forests through the implementation of an awareness policy and reforestation one hand, and an efficient monitoring and protection of national protected areas and parks."
2390861,21349,11104,Applying fire spread simulation over two study sites in California lessons learned and future plans,2007,"There is an increasing application for bushfire spread models in planning for prescribed burning and for the generation of fire risk assessment maps in fire prone communities. An evaluation of FARSITE and FlamMap bushfire spread models developed by the Fire Sciences Laboratory at Missoula involved a comparison of fire simulator models over two Californian landscapes representing different terrain and vegetation regimes. The paper includes a discussion on the models, the assumptions and limitations resulting from their application, and also the assembly of data to build landscape files and model outputs over the two test areas. The spatial datasets used in this study are sourced from the USGS EROS Data Center's LANDFIRE database at 30-metre pixel resolution. Information about fuel which has been derived from satellite imagery, terrain modelling and biophysical and local field knowledge was used to build Anderson's 13 Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM13) and Scott and Burgan's 40 Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM40). These were ingested into the FARSITE fire growth simulation model and FlamMap fire potential simulator. The FBFM40 provides a better representation of fuel across the landscape, leading to an improvement in surface fire intensity prediction and increased precision in determining crown fire behaviour. The FARSITE/FlamMap were used to model fire behaviour, and WindWizard simulated wind speed and direction scenarios across the Woodacre and Glen Ellen regions near San Francisco, California. FARSITE and FlamMap are two separate fire simulation models that use the same input datasets (vegetation/ground cover type, crown stand height, crown base height, crown bulk density, temperature, humidity, precipitation, slope, aspect, elevation, wind speed and direction). In this study, the actual fire perimeters were not available to compare the overestimated and underestimated fire growth perimeters/areas after and before using gridded wind data into the fire simulation. However, previous studies demonstrate that incorporation of gridded wind data clearly improves prediction of fire growth perimeters. The preliminary evaluation of FARSITE/FlamMap simulations appropriately predicts fire growth process and assesses resources at risk, suggesting the need for further experiments in areas of different terrain and vegetation, and with varied weather conditions. In future research, it is proposed to evaluate how these models compare with existing Australian fire models by using the example of recent Australian wildfire events."
365849,21349,11104,Chemical and structural dynamics of a geothermal system,2004,"In an ongoing project to relate surface hydrothermal alteration to structurally controlled geothermal aquifers, we mapped a 16 km swath of the eastern front of the Stillwater Range using Hyperspectral fault and mineral mapping techniques. The Dixie Valley Fault system produces a large fractured aquifer heating Pleistocene aged groundwater to a temperature of 285/spl deg/ C at 5-6 km. Periodically over the last several thousand years, seismic events have facilitated flow of heated fluids to the surface, leaving a rich history of hydrothermal alteration in the Stillwater Mountains. At Dixie Hot Springs, the potentiometric surface of the aquifer intersects the surface, and 75/spl deg/ C waters flow into the valley. We find a high concentration of alunite, kaolinite, and dickite on the exposed fault surface directly adjacent to a series of active fumaroles on the range front fault. This assemblage of minerals implies interaction with water temperatures in excess of 200/spl deg/ C. Field spectra support the location of the high temperature mineralization. Fault mapping using a digital elevation model in combination with mineral lineation and Held studies show that complex fault interactions in this region are improving permeability in the region leading to unconfined fluid flow to the surface. Seismic studies conducted 10 km to the south, at Dixie Hot Springs, show that the range front fault dips 25-30/spl deg/ to the southeast [R. E. Abbott et al. (2001)]. At Dixie Meadows the fault dips 35/spl deg/ southeast showing that this region is part of the low angle normal fault system that produced the Dixie Valley Earthquake in 1954 (M=6.8). We conclude that this unusually low angle faulting may have been accommodated by the presence of heated fluids increasing pore pressure within the fault zone. We also find that younger synthetic faulting is occurring at more typical high angles. In an effort to present these findings visually, we created a cross-section, illustrating our interpretation of the subsurface structure and the hypothesized locations of increased permeability. The success of these methods at Dixie Meadows will greatly improve our understanding of other Basin and Range geothermal systems."
932022,21349,11104,Multispectral absorption algorithm for retrieving TSS concentrations in water,2007,"The environmental problems caused by the increase of pollutant. It is the result of industrial waste and environmental accidents. One of the main sources of water pollution is suspended solids. When these suspended particles settle to the bottom of a water body, they become sediments. Optical methods offer two possibilities: scattering and transmission. The design of optical sensor systems is based on the interaction between the photons of the electromagnetic radiation and suspended particles in water. Pollution usually results in higher total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations or turbidity. Water pollution is caused by any chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water. Suspended solids are small particles of solid pollutants that float on the surface of, or are suspended in waters. Water pollution has become increasingly critical in this present-day, whether in the developed or the developing countries. Total suspended solids (TSS) in water can be detected by a number of optical sensing techniques, which involve light interaction with suspended particles in water. The measurements of the transmittance give a method for determining the concentration of the particles. The objectives of this study are to derive multispectral absorption algorithm and to develop an optical system, which is based on absorption measurements for measuring the concentration of total suspended solids,TSS in water. The multispectral absorption algorithm has been developed and a new multispectral optical sensor system designed for measuring total suspended solids TSS concentrations in polluted water. The development of the optical algorithm was based on the Beer-Lambert law. Firstly, the water samples used for calibration were filtered and dried to obtain the TSS values. In this study, three light emitting diodes were used as sensing emitters (sources) and a silicon phototransistor as radiations detector. The radiation values were determined from the output voltage readings of the sensor system. An electronic circuit was designed and the readings were measured by using a digital multimeter. The major advantages in using an LED as the light sources are its relatively low power consumption and ability to be modulated electronically at rapid rates. Standard polluted samples were prepared for sensors calibration. As the concentration of total suspended solids P was increased, the intensity of the transmitted light decreased. The level of the photocurrent was linearly proportional to the pollutants concentration. The proposed multispectral algorithm was calibrated using the measured parameters. Its accuracy was determined based on correlation coefficient,R and the value of the root-mean square errors,RMSE. The results showed a good correlation between the radiation values and the total suspended solids concentrations. This optical system provides various advantages over the current portable turbidity meter, which uses a single infrared source. The main advantage is its capability provide water pollution levels accurately (i.e. total suspended solids concentration). It only requires inexpensive components and can be assembled easily. The proposed algorithm produced a high correlation coefficient and low root mean square error value. This new methodology is very important for measuring and monitoring TSS in polluted water areas."
1195193,21349,11104,Oil spill segmentation of SAR images via graph cuts,2007,"Segmentation of dark patches in SAR images is an important step in any oil spill detection system. Segmentation methods used so far include 'adaptive image thresholding', 'hysteresis thresholding', 'edge detection' (see [1] and references therein) and entropy methods like the 'maximum descriptive length' technique [2]. This paper extends and generalizes a previously proposed Bayesian semi-supervised segmentation algorithm [3] oriented to oil spill detection using SAR images. In the base algorithm on which we build on, the data term is modeled by a finite mixture of Gamma distributions, with a given predefined number of components, for modeling each one of two classes (oil and water). To estimate the parameters of the class conditional densities, an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was developed. The prior is an M- level logistic (MLL) Markov Random Field enforcing local continuity in a statistical sense. The methodology proposed in [3] assumes two classes and known smoothness parameter. The present work removes these restrictions. The smoothness parameter controlling the degree of homogeneity imposed on the scene is automatically estimated and the number of used classes is optional. To extend the algorithm to an optional number of classes, the so-called alpha-expansion algorithm [4] has been implemented. This algorithm is a graph-cut based technique that finds efficiently (polynomial complexity) the local minimum of the energy, (i.e, a labeling) within a known factor of the global minimum. In order to estimate the smoothness parameter of the MLL prior, two different techniques have been tested, namely the least squares (LS) fit and the coding method (CD) [5]. Semi-automatic estimation of the class parameters is also implemented. This represents an improvement over the base algorithm [3], where parameter estimation is performed on a supervised way by requesting user defined regions of interest representing the water and the oil. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with simulated SAR images and real ERS and ENVISAT images."
2426111,21349,11104,Rapid image product generation from high-resolution satellite imagery for disaster management,2005,"The Indian-ocean tsunami occurring on the morning of 26 December 2004 caused the most devastating disaster in the known history of Thailand. Remotely-sensed data, particularly high-resolution satellite imagery such as 1m Ikonos images, played a crucial role as an up-to-date post-event information source for a variety of user groups including rescue teams, relief and aid workers, and policy makers. However, ready-to-use low-level image products shipped by the provider can contain absolute positioning errors ranging from 5 - 30 m. Mismatches can therefore occur when georectified imagery is overlaid with vector data such as transportation networks or landmarks and this can complicate further analysis, both visually and analytically. More metrically precise image products can be generated through photogrammetric techniques, but systematic errors in the provided rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs), which describe the relationship between image and ground coordinates, can still cause computed absolute ground coordinates to be in error by several pixels. The bias-compensation technique described in this paper can be used to correct RPC values. Test results on stereo-pairs of Ikonos images have shown that the resulting horizontal error of bias-corrected imagery is reduced to just above the 1m level, making the image comparable in terms of metric accuracy to a 1:5,000 scale map. This 1m level accuracy can be achieved with only one ground control point, the coordinates of which are measured by the real- time kinematic (RTK) GPS technique. Furthermore, field control point measurements can be totally avoided if large-scale maps of the desired areas exist and well-defined points can be found to be present in both the map and image. The presented bias- compensation technique has clearly demonstrated its suitability as a rapid geopositioning correction tool for the generation of precise satellite image products for disaster management."
1908092,21349,11104,A radar suite for ice sheet accumulation measurements and near-surface internal layer mapping,2009,"Many satellite, airborne, and in situ observations have been made to better understand the mass balance of the ice sheets. Satellite missions such as GRACE, ICESat, and Cryosat provide broad coverage, but are only capable of collecting data at relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolutions [7] [8]. Satellite observations alone are not sufficient to fully understand all mechanisms responsible for changes in the overall ice sheet mass balance. While these are sufficient over much of the interior of the ice sheet, to understand and model the dynamics of fast flowing glaciers and the margins of the ice sheet, finer resolution data are required. Airborne platforms, especially autonomous platforms, allow for key regions of the ice sheets to be measured with fine-resolution remote sensing instruments. These platforms provide more accurate ice thickness estimates, internal layer mapping, and ice-bedrock interface imaging [2]. To address this gap in the observations, we are designing and developing an instrumentation suite to be deployed on crewed and uncrewed aircrafts. Here we will focus on two radars in the instrumentation suite: an accumulation radar and a radar altimeter. The altimeter will be capable of measuring surface elevation and near-surface internal layers to a depth of about 10 m. The accumulation radar will be capable of measuring internal layers to a depth of about 100 m. A previously developed 150 MHz radar depth sounder/imager will be used to map layers below 100 m, as well as the ice-bedrock interface. This radar is beyond the scope of this paper. Field data collection using these systems will be performed simultaneously, providing a fine-resolution characterization of the ice sheet from surface to bedrock. The altimeter provides annual and short-term information on the accumulation, while the accumulation radar provides information on the decadal scale variability. The depth sounder provides information on the century scale variability. Initial data collection occurred during the early spring 2009 Greenland field season; additional data collection will continue during future campaigns both in Greenland and Antarctica. System refinements will allow for this suite to be deployed on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), also being developed at the Center for Remote Sensing (CReSIS) at the University of Kansas."
1136051,21349,11104,Overview Of Sentinel-2,2012,"GMES is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) to provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design towards a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the MSI with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 60 m depending on the spectral band with a 290 km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and large spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime (extendable to 12 years) over a 20-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen by mid-2014. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same sun synchronous orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator."
404805,21349,11104,"Simultaneous Earth views from CERES, MISR and MOPITT",2004,"The ultimate goal of NASA's Terra mission is to unravel the mysteries of climate and environmental change. The instruments on board the Terra spacecraft are collecting global data sets needed to study the interrelationships inherent in the Earth's coupled atmosphere-land-ocean-biosphere system. Issues such as the Earth's energy balance, global cloudiness, the effects of atmospheric aerosols, and the impact of trace gases on climate can be addressed with simultaneous data from instruments such as the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT). An important feature of the experiments onboard Terra is the ability to obtain data from multiple instruments viewing the same phenomena. CERES, MISR and MOPITT data available from the Atmospheric Sciences Data Center (ASDC) at NASA's Langley Research Center are used to demonstrate various complementary views of the Earth system. Examples are given of spatially and temporally coincident data covering phenomena such as aerosol concentrations from dust storms, and carbon monoxide and smoke associated with fires. CERES uses broadband radiometric measurements in three channels to provide both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation throughout the atmosphere and, in combination with simultaneous measurements from instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), provides new information on cloud properties. MISR obtains precisely calibrated images taken simultaneously at nine different angles and four wavelengths (blue, green, red and near-infrared) to provide data related to aerosols, clouds, and the Earth's surface. MOPITT is a scanning radiometer designed to measure tropospheric profiles and total column amount of carbon monoxide on both the day and night portions of an orbit. Information about the available CERES, MISR and MOPITT data products, and how to obtain them can be found at the ASDC web site: http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov"
2975387,21349,11104,Flash floods in Malir basin due to urbanization,2016,"Karachi is a strategic city of Pakistan since it serves as the gateway for international trade through the country's oldest port. This city has faced rapid population increase and industrial growth which are now causing environmental issues, social problems and economic stresses and challenges. Urban development and industrialization have extensively changed the landuse/landcover (LULC) and drainage pattern of the city. Majority of the old streams have been blocked that caused localized flash flooding in the city after heavy rainfall events. The natural drainage network of Karachi consists of two (2) major river systems - Malir River on the eastern side of the city and Lyari River which passes through the center of the city draining majority of its storm water. These rivers and their tributaries have been affected very badly due to the urbanization and bad urban management. This paper discusses the changes in LULCs over the past 16 years selecting Malir basin as a case study. Hydraulic flood modeling of Malir River is also presented here for 50 and 100 years floods. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) Digital Elevation Model (1 Arc Second) and topographic sheets of 1975 and 2001 (1:50000) are used to demarcate natural drainage or Karachi District on digital maps and to delineate stream network using Geographical Information System (GIS) software tool Arc Hydro. Historical rainfall data are used to simulate runoff using hydrologic models HEC-HMS and GeoHMS. The flood extent is modeled using hydraulic models HEC-RAS and GeoRAS. GIS overlay analysis combines LULCs and river drainage layers to identify the blocked area and to quantify the specific LULCs that caused the river blockades. Maps of blockages and flood extent can be used for revival of natural drainage network and flood mitigation and preparedness. The beneficiaries of this study may include local disaster risk management, planning and development authorities."
320241,21349,11104,Enhanced snow cover mapping using combined optical and passive microwave data,2004,"Snow cover is an important variable for climate and hydrologic models due to its effects on energy and moisture budgets. Over the past several decades both optical and passive microwave satellite data have been utilized for snow mapping at the regional to global scale. Snow mapping using optical data is based primarily on the magnitude of the surface reflectance, and in some cases on specific spectral signatures, while microwave data can be used to identify snow cover because the microwave energy emitted by the underlying soil is scattered by the snow grains resulting in a sharp decrease in brightness temperature and a characteristic negative spectral gradient. We present results which describe the respective advantages and disadvantages of these two types of satellite data for snow cover mapping and demonstrate how a multi-sensor product is optimal. Passive microwave and optical data sets for the Northern Hemisphere indicate similar patterns of inter-annual variability, although annual maximum snow extents and monthly variability derived from the optical data consistently exceed those provided by the microwave data. Because of the significant differences between snow products derived from passive microwave and optical data, especially during early winter, our current efforts to produce climate data records for snow cover focus on methods which combine the advantages of both data types. For the period 1978 to 2004 we combine data from the manually generated NOAA weekly snow charts, produced primarily from AVHRR and GOES data, with passive microwave data from the SMMR and SSM/I brightness temperature record. For the current and future time period we blend NASA EOS MODIS and AMSR-E data sets. Prototype snow cover maps from AMSR-E compare well with maps derived from SSM/I. Our current EASE-Grid blended product incorporates MODIS data from the Climate Modelers Grid (CMG) at approximately 5 km (0.05 deg.) with microwave-derived SWE at 25 km. resulting in a blended product that includes percent snow cover in the larger grid cell whenever the microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) signal is absent"
1886758,21349,11104,Combined microwave and hyperspectral infrared retrievals of atmospheric profiles in the presence of clouds using nonlinear stochastic methods,2007,"A nonlinear stochastic method for the retrieval of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles has been developed and evaluated with sounding data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), and is presently being adapted for use with the NPOESS Cross-track Infrared Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS) consisting of the hyperspectral Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS). The algorithm is implemented in three sequential stages: 1) stochastic cloud clearing (SCC), 2) eigenvector radiance compression and denoising, and 3) neural network (NN) estimation. First, the infrared radiance perturbations due to clouds are estimated and corrected by combined processing of the infrared and microwave data. Second, a Projected Principal Components (PPC) transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of and optimally extract geophysical profile information from the cloud-cleared infrared radiance data. Third, a feedforward neural network is used to estimate the desired geophysical parameters from the projected principal components. The performance of the algorithm (henceforth referred to as SCC/NN) was evaluated using global (ascending and descending) EOS-Aqua orbits co-located with ECMWF forecasts (generated every three hours on a 0.5-degree lat/lon grid) and radiosonde observations (RAOBs) for a variety of days throughout 2003 and 2004. Over 500,000 fields of regard (3times3 arrays of footprints) over ocean and land were used in the study. The performance of the SCC/NN algorithm exceeded that of the AIRS Level 2 (Version 4) algorithm throughout most of the troposphere while achieving approximately four times the yield. Furthermore, the SCC/NN performance in the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere greatly exceeds that of the AIRS Level 2 algorithm as the level of cloudiness increases. The SCC/NN algorithm requires significantly less computation than traditional variational retrieval methods while achieving comparable performance, thus the algorithm is particularly suitable for quick-look retrieval generation for post-launch CrIMSS performance validation."
806479,21349,11104,Estimation of heavy metal concentration in the Pearl River estuarine waters from remote sensing data,2012,"With the increase of population and the development of light industry in the Pearl River Delta area, a great deal of industrial and household waste waters with heavy metals are discharged to the ocean via the river channels. The heavy metals cannot be decomposed but can be transferred and accumulated with food chains [1, 2]. Many heavy metals are toxic to human beings. It is very important to measure the heavy metal concentration in the coastal waters for water quality investigation, environmental management and for security of aquaculture products. The remote sensing technology has been successfully applied for estimation of many parameters of water quality, such as the suspended sediments [3], chlorophyll a, [4–6], CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) [7–8], eutrophication [9–10], salinity [11], and water quality grades [12]. The remote sensing technology has many advantages over the conventional investigation of water quality for its high spatial and temporal resolution, low cost, big coverage of data and synchronization. With its development, the remote sensing technique is expected to retrieve more parameters of water quality. As the heavy metals in water exist in three forms[13–14], each of which is respectively controlled by optically-significant parameters, suspended sediments, dissolved organic matters and phytoplankton. Previous work showed the possibility of detecting heavy metal concentration from remote sensing data[15]. Eight cruises were conducted for in-situ data collection in the Pearl River estuary in August, October, November, December 2009 and February, March, July and October 2010, respectively. An above-water method was used for the measurement of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). The water-leaving radiance, the radiance reflected by a reference panel with 25% reflectance and the sky radiance were measured in turn for 3 times using the Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer (wavelength range from 346 to 1037 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.22 nm) at 128 sampling points, where the water samples were synchronously collected for lab analysis of concentration for three heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) and other water components (suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a and CDOM). The in-situ measured Rrs data were calculated to match the bands of EO-1 Hyperion and the Landsat-TM band 1 to 4. The relationships between the concentration of the three heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) and the remote sensing reflectance were analysed. The results showed that all the three heavy metals have good correlative relation with Rrs data. The correlative relation could be improved if it was analyzed respectively from data collected in dry season or wet season, and the correlative relation could be improved with the band ratio of Rrs. Algorithms for estimation of heavy metal concentration were developed using the ratio band combination, which has the maximum correlative coefficient with heavy metals. Then the algorithms were applied to Landsat TM data for estimation of the heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn) concentration. The results showed that the distribution of the three heavy metals' concentration is reasonable."
2056925,21349,11104,Assimilating Remote Sensing-Based ET into SWAP Model for Improved Estimation of Hydrological Predictions,2008,"An agro-hydrological simulation model is useful for agriculture monitoring and Remote Sensing provides useful information over large area. Combining both information by data assimilation is used in agro-hydrological modeling and predictions, where multiple remotely sensed data, ground measurement data and model forecast routinely combined in operational mapping procedures. Remote sensing cannot observe input parameters of agro-hydrological models directly. A method to estimate input parameters of such model from Remote Sensing using data assimilation has been proposed by Ines [2002] using the SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant) model. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) loaded stochastic physically based soil-water-atmosphere-plant model (SWAP) was extended for the discussed problem and used in the study. The objective of this study was to implement a data assimilation scheme to estimate hydrological parameters (e.g soil moisture) of SWAP model. For this study six Landsat TM/ETM satellite images were obtained for part of the Great Plains (Path 29, Row 32) in the states of Nebraska (NE) for the 2006 growing season (May-October). Then a land surface energy balance model (METRIC) was used to map spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration. The ability of METRIC accuracy was compared with the measurements at several flux sites with Bowen Ratio Energy Balance System units. Remotely sensed ET data and ground measurement data from experiment fields were then combined in a data assimilation to estimate parameters of the SWAP model. The system is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. The result shows that the reasonable parameters (sowing date and harvesting date, Ground water level) were successfully estimated. On the basis of estimated parameters, soil moisture is predicted by SWAP model. The agro-hydrological model driven by the observed ET produces reasonable water cycle states and fluxes, and the estimates are moderately improved by assimilating ET measurements that provides information on the surface soil moisture state, while it remains challenging to improve the results by assimilating regional ET estimated from satellite-based measurements."
2383084,21349,11104,Lightweight linear broadband antennas enabling small UAV wing systems and space flight nanosat concept,2004,"The RadSTAR initiative merges an interferometric radiometer with a digital beam forming scatterometer, providing Earth surface backscatter and emission measurements. Heretofore these instrument developments have been designed for low flying brown platforms such as the NASA P-3. Commercial-off-the-shelf design materials can be used to inexpensively build antennas that approximate free-space permittivity, enabling remote sensing of soil moisture levels locally using small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A foam/free-space sandwich can be used to minimize the weight of the dielectric backing structure. This technique enables rapid prototyping with space-grade materials. A low-mass 3-element antenna array of this design is already baselined for a University nano-satellite mission. A light-weighted version of the L-band Imaging Scatterometer (US) radar electronics is being developed for a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program. This lightweight wing antenna has a large potential payoff to NASA. For example, it may enable an active/passive hydrology mission using a fleet of low cost small UAVs. A mesh ground plane can further reduce the overall mass and stowability of the very large antennas required for spaceborne observations at L-Band. The cross track scan success criterion was met at L-Band frequencies for radar and radiometry. That is, we designed and prototyped a wideband antenna patch tunable in this range and additional work is being earned out to improve the cross polarization isolation. Making the present broadband design into arrays will be limited to one dimension due to array spacing and the aspect ratio of the patch elements. A fore and aft Doppler beam synthesis and the US cross-track beam forming concept will be considered for potential application to surface hydrology measurements using these arrays"
1001057,21349,11104,Critical assessment of the historical development of radar polarization technology towards radar polarimetry culminating in fully polarimetric-interferometric SAR,2012,"In this historical assessment of the development from polarization radar systems technology towards fully polarimetric POL-SAR airborne, high-altitude drones and satellite sensors, the at times slow and stepwise advances in step with -polarization device manufacture are critically analyzed. The main contributions from Kennaugh's fundamental polarization radar optimal null postulates of 1952 and its verification by Poelman in the 1970'ies with the first full polarimetric radar at SHAPE-TC will be highlighted, resulting with the chance discovery of Huynen's dissertation of 1970 in a thorough re-assessment of optimal polarization theory derived from Sinclair's scattering matrix formulation. With the introduction of the correct transformation matrix operators by Kostinski & Boerner 1982 for polarization basis transformation plus proper reduction of the 4×4 to the 3×3 reduced covariance and coherency matrices by Lueneburg & Boerner of the 1980'ies, it was possible to derive novel covariance matrix decomposition theories either based on physical reasoning by Durden & Freeman or on optimal eigenvalue theories by Cloude & Pottier during the 1990'ies. Hand in hand with digital SAR processing advances, polarimetric SAR systems technology enjoyed successful airborne (AIR-SAR, E-SAR, Convair-580 & PI-SAR) of the 1990ies, shuttle (SIR-C/XSAR) 1994, and satellite (ALOS-PALSAR, RADARSAT-II & Terra-SAR-X) verification of the past ten years, resulting in the first tandem satellite formation of TanDEM-X 2010. Although various incomplete dual-pol and compact-pol SAR implementations were and are still being pursued, the irreversible quest for fully polarimetric POL-IN-SAR decomposition theories of Yamaguchi with its verification by multi-band airborne, high-altitude drones and satellite sensors is highlighted. The succinct overview will be concluded with a comprehensive assessment of its plethora of steadily increasing applications including next to polar also equatorially orbiting tandem POL-IN-SAR sensors."
2235026,21349,11104,Design and Testing a New Instrument to Measure the Angular Reflectance of Terrestrial Surfaces,2006,"Satellite sensors can measure the solar energy reflected from the Earth's atmosphere and surface, and provide the only feasible method of obtaining global scale data on the state of the planet. The accuracy and reliability of data from satellite sensors is therefore of vital importance, and much effort goes into characterizing such instruments before launch. However, the stress of launch, and the extreme environment of space is known to affect the calibration of sensors, introducing uncertainty into the data they provide, especially the long time-series data necessary to investigate and monitor climate change. It is therefore vitally important that methods for the post-launch calibration and validation of data from satellite sensors are developed and tested. In order to do this it is necessary to have highly accurate data on the angular reflectance of natural surfaces, and this project aims to develop and test a new instrument to achieve this. To improve the accuracy of field measurements, a new instrument is being designed, in conjunction with the Natural Environmental Research Council Field Spectroscopy Facility (NERC FSF). The Gonio RAdiometric Spectrometer System (GRASS) is being developed at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), in its Optical Radiation Measurement Team. It is intended to provide quasi-simultaneous, multi-angle, multi- spectral measurements of Earth surface reflected sunlight to support vicarious calibration of satellite sensors operating in the optical region and the validation of their products. The instrument is required to be easily and quickly assembled in remote situations, be robust and transportable to remote locations and its measurements fully traceable to SI units. The GRASS instrument is currently being assembled at the NPL and will be deployed in summer 2006 as part of an experiment to validate data from a range of airborne and satellite sensors. The paper will review existing methods of measuring BRDF in the field, highlight the improvements that GRASS will provide to users, and describe the experiments performed to test its performance."
1982824,21349,11104,An interdisciplinary approach at studying the Earth-Sun system with GPS/GNSS and GPS-like signals,2005,"The value of the Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements to atmospheric science, space physics, and ocean science, is now emerging or showing a potential to play a major role in the evolving programs of NASA, NSF and NOAA. The objective of this communication is to identify and articulate the key scientific questions that are optimally, or perhaps uniquely, addressed by GPS or GPS-like observations, and discuss their relevance to existing or planned national Earth-science research programs. The GPS-based ocean reflection experiments performed to date have demonstrated the precision and spatial resolution suitable to altimetric applications that require higher spatial resolution and more frequent repeat than the current radar altimeter satellites. GPS radio occultation is promising as a climate monitoring tool because of its benchmark properties: its raw observable is based on extremely accurate timing measurements. GPS-derived temperature profiles can provide meaningful climate trend information over decadal time scales without the need for overlapping missions or mission-to-mission calibrations. By acquiring data as GPS satellites occult behind the Earth's limb, GPS also provides high vertical resolution information on the vertical structure of electron density with global coverage. New experimental techniques will create more comprehensive TEC maps by using signals reflected from the oceans and received in orbit. This communication will discuss a potential future GNSS Earth Observing System project which would deploy a constellation of satellites using GPS and GPS-like measurements, to obtain a) ocean topography measurements based on GPS reflections with an accuracy and horizontal resolution suitable for eddy monitoring, and b) climate-records quality atmospheric temperature profiles. The constellation would also provide for measurements of ionospheric electron density. This is a good example of an interdisciplinary mission concept, with broad science objectives of high societal relevance, all resting on common cost-effective technology."
2428046,21349,11104,Spaceborne P-band radar for ice-sheet sounding: design and performances,2004,"The Antarctic ice sheet is one of the most prominent physical features on our planet. It represents an area of about 14 millions km/sup 2/. The average ice thickness being around 2200 m (and up to 4500 m), the Antarctic ice sheet contains a 30 million km/sub 3/ ice volume corresponding to about 70 m of sea level. However, this huge reservoir of water is still partially unknown and due to its large extent, only observations from space can give some global insight into the structure of the ice sheet. The Antarctic ice sheet is an exceptional archive of the past climates and a major actor of the Earth water cycle. Each ice layer corresponding to one period of time keeps its own chemical characteristics linked to past atmospheric events. The typical temporal scale involved allow for a description of past climate over a few climatic cycles, or a few 100000-year events. A dedicated mission has been proposed to European Space Agency as a candidate for an Earth Explorer Opportunity mission. This mission is based on a P-band radar instrument with a nadir-looking geometry, working at 435 MHz with a bandwidth of 6 MHz (imposed by ITU regulation), allowing to sound the vertical structure of the ice from the surface down to the bedrock. A feasibility study of the mission was done in Alcatel Space under ESA contract with an emphasis on the radar instrument. For coherent reflection and deep sounding (corresponding to the so-called Fresnel zone), the useful signal coming from any ice layer or from the bedrock overlap with lateral incoherent surface scattering. The surface clutter is reduced by the antenna pattern in the across-track direction (typical aperture is lower than 5/spl deg/) and by Doppler filtering in the along-track direction. These beam requirements impose to have a very long antenna in the across-track direction. The typical dimension of the antenna is 10 m /spl times/ 1 m. This work summarizes the principle of the instrument, and the associated antenna solution. Main performances are also presented."
2434314,21349,11104,Neural network retrieval of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles from cloud-cleared AIRS/AMSU radiances,2004,"A novel statistical method for the retrieval of atmospheric temperature and moisture (relative humidity) profiles has been developed and evaluated with sounding data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). The algorithm is implemented in three stages. First, the infrared radiance perturbations due to clouds are estimated and corrected by combined processing of the infrared and microwave data. Second, a Projected Principal Components (PPC) transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of and optimally extract geophysical profile information from the cloud-cleared infrared radiance data. Third, an artificial feedforward neural network (NN) is used to estimate the desired geophysical parameters from the projected principal components. The cloud-clearing of the infrared radiances was performed by the AIRS Science Team using infrared brightness temperature contrasts in adjacent fields of view and microwave-derived estimates of the infrared clear-column radiances to estimate and correct the radiance contamination introduced by clouds. The PPC compression technique was used to reduce the infrared radiance dimensionality by a factor of ~100, while retaining over 99.99 percent of the radiance variance that is correlated to the geophysical profiles. This compression allows the use of smaller, faster, and more robust estimators. A single-layer feedforward neural network with approximately 3000 degrees of freedom was then used to estimate the geophysical profiles in 1-km layers from the surface to 20 km. The performance of this method (henceforth referred to as the PPC/NN method) was evaluated using global EOS-Aqua orbits colocated with European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) fields for two days in 2003: September 3 and October 12. Over 15,000 footprints over ocean were used in the study. Retrieval performance compares favorably with that obtained with simulated observations from the NOAA88b radiosonde set of approximately 7500 profiles. The PPC/NN method requires significantly less computation than traditional variational retrieval methods, while achieving comparable performance"
2521161,21349,11104,Fusion of ALOS Palsar and Landsat ETM data for land cover classification and biomass modeling using non-linear methods,2009,"This work demonstrates the utility of reduced resolution ALOS Palsar data for biomass mapping and land cover classification over the tropical forests of Indonesia. This study is important because we processed the ALOS Palsar mosaic, which is made freely available within K&C initiatives project and will be updated regularly. We first used 38 sample plots collected on the ground during dry season in September 2004, to develop a tree diameter (dbh) — biomass model. The HH, HV, HV/HH and HH-HV backscatters of ALOS Palsar data allowed the empirical estimation of forest above ground biomass (AGB). Each band of Palsar data was separately used to estimate the biomass, and we found HV band resulted in better correlation with the AGB compared to other SAR bands. Validation of the prediction results was carried out by comparing the biomass estimates with those predicted from an existing allometric equation. Optical data are sensitive to the physical properties of the reflectors whereas SAR data are more influenced by the geometric properties of the scatterers. Therefore, the second part of this study concerned the integration of mosaic SAR textures and ETM data for land cover classification. The classification was conducted using ETM data and variations of ETM, SAR bands, and SAR textures calculated using GLC Matrix. The image classifications were carried out using a Machine Learning based classifier, so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a conventional Maximum Likelihood method. An ensemble of neural networks method using Kalman Filter and scaled conjugate gradient algorithm was applied. The classification accuracy was assessed using confusion matrices and Kappa Statistics. We show that the introduction of SAR textures significantly enhanced the classification accuracies. This study showed that the joint processing of SAR and multispectral data increased the accuracies of biomass estimation and landuse classifications. The efficiency of the method at medium spatial resolutions allows its application of global datasets."
1905223,21349,11104,The study of wetlands change in Yellow River delta Based on RS and GIS,2007,"In recent years, the water and sediment were dropped significantly in Yellow River, the average annual water and sediment discharge was 143.5 X 108 m 3  and 3.75 X 108 t respectively, accounting for 29.2% and 31.2% of the 1950-1969 values. In addition, the day of flow depletion was also increased continuously and there was 21 years of flow depletion from 1972 to 1998. Especially in 1997 the day of flow depletion was up to 226 days in the section below Lijin Hydraulic Station. In the new hydrological environment the Yellow River delta eco- environment must be changed. Based on Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (RS & GIS) technology, we study what and how the Yellow River delta wetlands changed in the new hydrologic conditions in recent years using the Landsat TM/ETM+ image of 1996, 2000 and 2004. The results show that the area of the wetlands in Yellow River Delta was increased and from 1996 to 2004 the area of the wetlands has been increased 22838.55 hm 2  and the increase rate was 2854.82 hm 2 /y. The area of the nature wetlands and the artificial wetlands were increased as a whole, but their change character was different. The area of the nature wetlands was increased quickly from 1996 to 2000, which is related to that the national park of Yellow River delta was changed in 1996 and from 2000 to 2004 it was increased tardily. On the contrary, the area of the artificial wetlands was decreased tardily from 1996 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2004 it was increased quickly. In the mean time the area of river, bottomland and paddy field was decreased and the area of swampland, reed marsh, reservoir, saline and acequia was increased. To scrutinize the dynamic changes of wetlands, the simulation for transformation of the wetland types has been carried out by means of the ecological Markov Process. The results showed that the whole transfer velocity of the wetlands is 2.99 % from 1996 to 2000 and the transfer among the wetland types is simple, but from 2000 to 2004 the transfer velocity of the wetlands is 6.95% and the transfer among the different wetland types is complex correspondingly. Moreover the reason of the wetlands changing has been analyzed in this paper. Firstly, the reciprocity between the decrease of the water and sediment and the regulating water and sediment is the main reason of the wetlands change. Aiming at the decrease of the water and sediment entering the Yellow River, the water and sediment regulation is an important measure which has positive impact on the Yellow River Delta Wetlands. Secondly, the process of the agriculture exploitation, city building and wetlands protection is also an important factor of the wetlands change. In order to resolve the problems of the excessive exploitation, wetlands pollution and so on, many protection measures, such as strengthening the management of the Yellow River, doing better program and dynamic monitoring, keeping harmony between the exploitation and recovery of the wetlands and paying attention to the wetland pollution, were carried out. Thirdly, the climate change and storm surge disaster are explicit factors of the wetlands change. This study has significance for building and protecting of eco-environment in Yellow River delta."
2917921,21349,11104,Progress in the calibration/validation of VIIRS on Suomi NPP and J1,2016,"This paper presents the recent progress in the cal/val of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (NPP) since launch, and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) J1 which will be launched in 2017. The Suomi NPP VIIRS instrument continues to perform well with a very stable calibration according to extensive comparisons with other instruments and at vicarious validation sites. The calibration accuracy for most bands meet the specification and user needs, although additional efforts are being made to meet more stringent needs such as ocean color applications. The VIIRS Sensor Data Records (SDR) have been operationally used at the Alaska National Weather Service, and have been used to generate a large number of environmental data records ranging from aerosols, fire, to ocean color, sea surface temperature, vegetation, and many others. However, since many updates have been made to the operational processing of VIIRS since launch, inconsistency exists in the long term data records. To address this issue, the VIIRS SDR team is preparing for the reprocessing of the VIIRS historical data using the new automated calibration module RSBAutocal, with the latest calibration coefficients. The reprocessed data will be more consistent over the entire history of VIIRS with all known corrections. At the same time, significant efforts are devoted to the prelaunch calibration of the JPSS J1 VIIRS. While in general the J1 VIIRS performance meets specifications, there are performance waivers and as a result, mitigations have to be developed. This includes the implementation of a new aggregation scheme to address the nonlinear response of the VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB). Other waivers include the larger than expected polarization sensitivity which will impact the ocean color bands and additional corrections will be needed postlaunch. In addition, the team has also been performing a trade study for adding a water vapor band to future VIIRS. Many of these efforts have been documented in the VIIRS special issue in the remote sensing open access journal which is being finalized to reach out to a broader user community."
2205880,21349,11104,Spectral characterisation and mapping of Welwitschia mirabilis in Namibia,2009,"Remote Sensing bears the potential to contribute towards identification and mapping of endemic and endangered plant species. This study assesses the spatial distribution of Welwitschia mirabilis, an ancient desert plant species, in its natural habitat, Africa's Namib desert. Welwitschia mirabilis is one of the oldest plants in existence; some plants reach an age of up to 1500 years. Considered as a living fossil, the plant is difficult to map both due to the fragile ecosystem in which it lives, and the fact that a large part of its indigenous area is inaccessible as a result of diamond mining. In a first step, various Welwitschia individuals from botanical institutions within Switzerland are spectrally characterized using an ASD FieldSpec3 spectroradiometer. These data sets are investigated to a) identify potential spectral differences within and among individuals and b) elaborate possible common spectral characteristics of the genus usable for remote sensing recognition. The results of these experiments show that the overall spectral behaviour of Welwitschia does not represent potential influencing factors like plant age, plant stress and environment, which makes the signal suitable for remote sensing species detection. In a second step, mapping of individual Welwitschia plants is performed in a valley of the Namib-Naukluft Park using multispectral IKONOS satellite data of high spatial resolution. The plant species are classified using a maximum likelihood approach. It can be concluded that with the IKONOS data used, an adequate result may only be achieved under ideal conditions where Welwitschia individuals and additional plants (e.g., acacias, bushes) grow apart from each other on a homogeneous background consisting of bright gravel and sand. Despite the huge amount of shadow fractions within a plant pixel due to the spatial resolution of the image, the species Welwitschia was successfully detected by its typical spectral signal. Spatial and spectral resolution remain a limiting factor in accurately mapping individual Welwitschia species and detecting them in a heterogeneously vegetated environment. Future spaceborne sensors of higher spatial and spectral resolution can further contribute towards an improved assessment of plant individuals from space and may therefore support the detection of threatened, invasive or prohibited species."
649488,21349,23735,Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicle: Modeling and simulation,2014,"The complete modeling and simulation of an unmanned vehicle with combined aerial and underwater ca- pabilities, called Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicle (HUAUV), is presented in this paper. The best architecture for this kind of vehicle was evaluated based on the adaptation of typical platforms for aerial and underwater vehicles, to allow the navigation in both environments. The model selected was based on a quadrotor-like aerial platform, adapted to dive and move underwater. Kinematic and dynamic models are presented here, and the parameters for a small dimension prototype was estimated and simulated. Finally, controllers were used and validated in realistic simulation, including air and water navigation, and the environment transition problem. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first vehicle that is able to navigate in both environment without mechanical adaptation during the medium transitions. I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, unmanned autonomous vehicles have been the focus of many development efforts, with a large range of applications. The amount of resources applied has improved their capabilities, especially in the military field. Remotely operated or autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), for example, were used in recent military operations around the world (1). But they were also used in non-military activities, like agriculture (2) and surveillance (3). Another important robotic platform are the Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), whose the most known are the Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). This kind of vehicles can also be applied in several commercial field operations (4), e.g. oil and gas extraction in ultra deep waters (5). Both kind of vehicles are well adapted to work in their own environment (air and water, respectively), but some situations may require a single vehicle capable of working in both environment. Such requirement commonly appears when is necessary to perform maintenance on partially or fully submersing structures, as ship hull or risers. A typical approach includes using auxiliary vessels to transport ROVs that will make the inspection of offshore target regions. This problem is harder in partially submersed structures. In such situations, where the usage of auxiliary ships is difficult and expensive, underwater robots equipped with wheels or tracks are recommended."
2199404,21349,11104,The cause analysis on the lowest runoff in the upper reaches of Yellow River from 1990 to 2004,2011,"Based on the data of meteorological and hydrological collected from 1961 to 2004, the cause have been analyzed on the lowest runoff in the upper reaches of yellow River in recent years in this paper. The results indicate runoff recorded exhibited slight decrease trend from 1961 to 2004, but there is a notable decrease trend of runoff since 1990. It is noteworthy that low stream continued 15 years from 1990 to 2004, besides 1993 and 1999. Moreover, 9 year amount of runoff anomalous percentage below − 30% among 13 years of the low runoff years, account for 69%, contrast to 6.5% from 1736 to 1998. The paper has discussed the cause of the persistent low flow in the upper reaches of Yellow River in recent years based on the data of general circulation of atmosphere, sea-surface temperature(SST), sensible heat flux over Tibetan Plateau, precipitation, temperature, wind speed, sunshine time, amount of evaporation and maximum depth of frozen ground since 1990. The main cause is showed to be persistent low precipitation since 1990, which may be caused by NAOI maintained positive height phase in winter, East Asian big trough leaning depth, West Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure ridge line position near southerly, greater sensible heat flux in spring and summer over Tibetan Plateau and stronger geothermal fields that easily result in a kind of typical Northwest drought circulation of 500hPa south positive and north negative, west positive and east negative, weak north wind and strong west wind, and deep East Asian trough and strong Xinjiang ridge in summer in East Asian. Secondarily, the reduction of rainy days above 5 mm and steady rainy days, higher temperature and larger evaporation in spring and summer is disadvantageous to create runoff. The results also indicate that the drought of the surface in the basin resulted in the decreasing trend of the runoff."
978693,21349,11104,Icesat lidar and global digital elevation models: applications to desdyni,2010,"Geodetic control is extremely important in the production and quality control of topographic data sets, enabling elevation results to be referenced to an absolute vertical datum. Global topographic data with improved geodetic accuracy achieved using global Ground Control Point (GCP) databases enable more accurate characterization of land topography and its change related to solid Earth processes, natural hazards and climate change. The multiple-beam lidar instrument that will be part of the NASA Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) mission will provide a comprehensive, global data set that can be used for geodetic control purposes. Here we illustrate that potential using data acquired by NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICEsat) that has acquired single-beam, globally distributed laser altimeter profiles (± 86o) since February of 2003 [1, 2]. The profiles provide a consistently referenced elevation data set with unprecedented accuracy and quantified measurement errors that can be used to generate GCPs with sub-decimeter vertical accuracy and better than 10 m horizontal accuracy. Like the planned capability for DESDynI, ICESat records a waveform that is the elevation distribution of energy reflected within the laser footprint from vegetation, where present, and the ground where illuminated through gaps in any vegetation cover [3]. The waveform enables assessment of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with respect to the highest, centroid, and lowest elevations observed by ICESat and in some cases with respect to the ground identified beneath vegetation cover. Using the ICESat altimetry data we are developing a comprehensive database of consistent, global, geodetic ground control that will enhance the quality of a variety of regional to global DEMs. Here we illustrate the accuracy assessment of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM produced for Australia, documenting spatially varying elevation biases of several meters in magnitude."
362032,21349,11104,"A study of farmland landscape pattern with TM and DEM. Case study in Yongsheng County, Yunnan Province, P.R.China",2004,"The application of TM images and digital elevation model (DEM) is rising and promising in the field of landscape ecology and land cover change detection. This study presents it, and GIS-based technology route is recommended in the TM application. The study area is Yongsheng County, Yunnan Province, P. R. China. Six Landsat TM images are acquired over Yongsheng County with geometrical correction, procession and classification. Landscape types, including farmland, urban area, forest, watershed, wasteland and selected farmland are obtained as areas of interest. The elevation and grade maps of Yongsheng County are produced on its digital elevation model (DEM) with a scale of 1:250,000. We group the elevation into five levels: 1,000-1500 m, 1500-2000 m, 2000-2500 m, 2500-3000 m, and above 3000 m; and four levels are determined for grade maps, i.e., 0-6, 6-15, 15-25, and above 25 degrees. Under the help of GIS tools, area of six landscape types on five elevation levels is calculated separately. We also obtain area of farmland on each elevation and grade level through the same methodology. All these data work in the subsequent analysis of landscape pattern. It is found that farmland mostly locates in areas with elevation below 2,000 m and grade less than 15 degrees, for example, 'candid' areas. We can interpret it by the great ease these candid areas provide for farm work. The Index of Component Fragmentation Degree (ICFD) is used to evaluate human's disturbance on farmland. ICFD is relatively small for 'candid' areas due to comparatively large farmland patches, but maximizes itself where elevation is from 2,000 to 2,500 m. It gives a signal of serious human disturbance there. This disturbance is just deforestation for farmland on this belt. We also analyze the landscape pattern of urban areas. Its area reaches a maximum on the belt with elevation between 1,500 and 2,000 m. It's also considerable that urban area decreases as the elevation increases and reaches almost ZERO where elevation is above 3,000 m. Results presented in this paper suggest that farmland landscape pattern shows its vertical variance according to elevation ranges, and human's disturbance weights much in this variance. This study also provides information on deforestation for farmland, and it seems valuable in environmental protection and region regulation"
1796116,21349,11104,The hydrosphere State (hydros) Satellite mission: an Earth system pathfinder for global mapping of soil moisture and land freeze/thaw,2004,"The Hydrosphere State Mission (Hydros) is a pathfinder mission in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth System Science Pathfinder Program (ESSP). The objective of the mission is to provide exploratory global measurements of the earth's soil moisture at 10-km resolution with two- to three-days revisit and land-surface freeze/thaw conditions at 3-km resolution with one- to two-days revisit. The mission builds on the heritage of ground-based and airborne passive and active low-frequency microwave measurements that have demonstrated and validated the effectiveness of the measurements and associated algorithms for estimating the amount and phase (frozen or thawed) of surface soil moisture. The mission data will enable advances in weather and climate prediction and in mapping processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. The Hydros instrument is a combined radar and radiometer system operating at 1.26 GHz (with VV, HH, and HV polarizations) and 1.41 GHz (with H, V, and U polarizations), respectively. The radar and the radiometer share the aperture of a 6-m antenna with a look-angle of 39/spl deg/ with respect to nadir. The lightweight deployable mesh antenna is rotated at 14.6 rpm to provide a constant look-angle scan across a swath width of 1000 km. The wide swath provides global coverage that meet the revisit requirements. The radiometer measurements allow retrieval of soil moisture in diverse (nonforested) landscapes with a resolution of 40 km. The radar measurements allow the retrieval of soil moisture at relatively high resolution (3 km). The mission includes combined radar/radiometer data products that will use the synergy of the two sensors to deliver enhanced-quality 10-km resolution soil moisture estimates. In this paper, the science requirements and their traceability to the instrument design are outlined. A review of the underlying measurement physics and key instrument performance parameters are also presented."
1498552,21349,11104,Land use and land cover monitoring with multitemporal and multipolarization Radarsat data: Application to an intensive agricultural area (France),2014,"Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) represent a key factor for a sustainable development. These ones, in modifying earth-atmosphere interactions contribute to the global change (climate change, desertification, deforestation, water pollution, etc.). Among LULCC, those linked to agriculture activity which necessitates almost 85% of water resource at a world scale appears to be as the main source of greenhouse gas emission [1]. Intensive agriculture model is since several decades the object of numerous debates at the world scale [2], calling for a change of his production model because of its negative effects, in particular at an environmental and sanitary level (water pollution, soil erosion, biodiversity reduction…). But for a sustainable agriculture development, able to feed near 9 billion of persons in 2050, scientific community needs first a better understanding of LULC dynamics. In this context, a fine characterization of the spatiotemporal LULCC is first required, based generally with remote sensing data processing. Nevertheless, with optical data a fine LULC characterization is not easy because of the high occurrence of cloudy conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, which record images that allow characterizations of terrestrial surfaces despite cloudy climate, offer interesting potentialities for monitoring this type of land use. They are the only one sensors which provide systematic data acquisition and now, their high spatial and temporal resolution offer numerous advantages for a better land cover extraction and characterisation in intensive agricultural area [3]. However, multitemporal SAR data are still less used than optical data because of their complexity (physical and geometrical), which necessitate specific processing [4]. We investigate here two types of multitemporal SAR data acquired by Radarsat-1 (HH) and Radarsat-2 (HH/HV) for land use characterization on an intensive agricultural area in France. Three objectives are defined:"
670399,21349,11104,Spatial patterns of the canopy stress during 2005 drought in Amazonia,2007,"In the last decades, the detection of drought occurrences and assessment of its severity using satellite data are becoming popular in disaster, desertification, crop production, phenology, land cover change and climate change studies. To detect the drought effects on different vegetation types, many methodologies have been developed, mostly relying on the use of vegetation indices. This communication reports the first attempt to assess the capability of MODIS NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from 2000 to 2006 time-series to detect the 2005 drought in Amazonia. To reach this objective, monthly composites of the MOD13A2 product were generated from period. Then, monthly anomalies were calculated, considering anomalous values when lower than -1 standard deviation (sd) or higher than 1 sd. Rainfall data provided by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was also acquired for the same time-series with the objective of supporting the understanding of vegetation response with the precipitation. Water deficit data calculated based on the TRMM data were also used to guide the sampling scheme. A land cover map for South America updated with natural land cover changes detected by the Near Real Time Deforestation Detection Project (DETER) was used as a mask to avoid false anomalies in the Brazilian Amazon. In general, NDWI and EVI showed to be sensitive and consistent for the temporal series used. NDVI presented a high variability and though a difficult interpretation. Critical months in the NDWI and EVI series coincided with the months with higher water stress calculated based on the TRMM data. EVI also showed to detect changes in the canopy structure. These preliminary results suggest that this is a strong methodology to be used in the spatial analysis of the extent of the drought effects in the vegetation. Literfall data will be incorporate in this research for validation purposes."
1361857,21349,11104,"Three-dimensional and higher-order imaging with tomographic SAR: Techniques, applications, issues",2015,"SAR tomography is a remote sensing technique, extending SAR interferometry, that allows three-dimensional imaging of multiple height-distributed point-like scatterers or volumetric targets. It allows, for example, to solve layover urban scatterers or to analyze the vertical structure of vegetation layers or other targets with significant penetration of the sensor's radiation (dry soil, ice layers, etc.). The ability to monitor the 3-D inner structure of volumetric targets and to extract information about the nature and location of ongoing scattering processes promises a break-through in key environmental problems. Indeed, structural parameters of volume scatterers in the biosphere and cryosphere, such as vegetation height and moisture content, forest vertical structure and biomass, or snow / ice depth and layering are critical inputs for ecological process modeling and enable effective monitoring of ecosystem change. The 3-D tomographic principle has been also extended to higher dimension in the more recent differential tomography methodology, producing 4-D (3-D + time) images bridging the gap between differential interferometry and SAR tomography. Due to their unique capabilities and potential, tomographic SAR techniques have gained significant attention during the last years and become established methods for analysis of all kinds of three-dimensional back-scattering scenarios. In particular, for future space-borne SAR sensors operating in longer wavelength, like BIOMASS, SAOCOM-CS or Tandem-L, it is planned to employ 3-D tomographic imaging modes on an operational basis. This paper aims to review the different state-of-the-art signal processing methods for three-dimensional SAR imaging, which have been developed during the last decade, and for four-dimensional differential tomography. The requirements, advantages and disadvantages of different techniques are assessed and compared and open issues to be addressed in future developments are pointed out."

This implementation was based on a vision for 2015 developed during 2005. The “EOSDIS 2015 Vision” emphasizes increased end-to-end data system efficiency and operability; increased data usability; improved support for end users; and decreased operations costs. One key feature of the Evolution plan was achieving higher operational maturity (ingest, reconciliation, search and order, performance, error handling) for the NASA's Earth Observing System Clearinghouse (ECHO). The ECHO system is an operational metadata registry through which the scientific community can easily discover and exchange NASA's Earth science data and services. ECHO contains metadata for 2, 726 data collections comprising over 87 million individual data granules and 34 million browse images, consisting of NASA's EOSDIS Data Centers' and the United States Geological Survey's Landsat Project holdings. ECHO stores metadata from a variety of science disciplines and domains, including Climate Variability and Change, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Earth Surface and Interior, Atmospheric Composition, Weather, and Water and Energy Cycle. ECHO provides a platform for the publication, discovery, understanding and access to NASA's Earth Observation resources (data, service and clients). In their native state, these data, service and client resources are not necessarily targeted for use beyond their original mission. However, with the proper interoperability mechanisms, users of these resources can expand their value, by accessing, combining and applying them in unforeseen ways. ECHO provides access to its capabilities through a set of services. These ECHO Applications Program Interfaces (APIs) are based on industry standards for performing web-based computing, specifically web services profile."

It is based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) GNSS receiver technology, as the core instrument for a future tsunami detection constellation of small low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. For use in reflectometry, scatterometry and radio-occultation measurements as well as high-precision navigation applications, specific adaptations of the GNSS receiver firmware are desirable, which require a close interaction between scientists and the receiver manufacturer. Within the GITEWS project GFZ has set up a team consisting of GFZ, DLR and JAVAD GNSS (JAVAD) to adapt and extend their new generation GNSS receivers for advanced scientific space applications. Specific adaptations address the improvement of the cold start time-to-first-fix, the selection of optimal tracking loop parameters and channel slaving for monitoring of reflected signals. Besides pseudorange, phase and signal-to-noise measurements, the modified receiver allows output of in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) accumulations at 5 msec intervals (200 Hz). As a major step forward compared to current space receivers, the new receiver supports tracking of the civil L2C signal of the GPS constellation. An overview of the current status is given and first results are discussed. Within GITEWS the feasibility of a tsunami detection mission is studied, including the constellation mission design, the options for operating the system and the ways to develop an end-to-end system for the quick response to tsunami events. In parallel simulation studies of the GNSS signals reflected to a LEO satellite are carried out. This will be realised by a Zavorotny and Voronovich scattering model with a two-scale model approach using an Elfouhaily sea wave spectrum. An overview of the current activities is given and first results are discussed."

It carries three remote sensing instruments: Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type-2 (AVNIR-2), Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) and Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Within the framework of European ALOS Data European Node (ADEN), European Space Research INstitute (ESRIN) as part of European Space Agency (ESA), teamed up with JAXA for contributing to ALOS commissioning phase plan. This paper summarizes the strategy that ESA adopted to define and implement a data verification plan for mission operated by foreign nation, classified as so called ESA Third Party Missions (TPM). The verification of ALOS optical data from PRISM / AVNIR-2 instruments activities had begun four months after satellite launch on March 2007.GAEL Consultant (French company) has supported ESA / ESRIN for designing and executing the plan. A team of principal investigator's has been put together to provide technical expertise. This paper includes a description of the verification plan and summarizes the methodologies that were used for radiometric, geometric and image quality assessment. Preliminary results indicate that the radiometric calibration of the AVNIR-2 sensor agrees with Landsat 5 (L5) Thematic Mapper and the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) calibration to within 10%. The geometry accuracy of PRISM and AVNIR-2 product remains within specifications but some recommendations are provided to improve the quality of product. The preliminary results from the PRISM image quality assessment through computation of PRISM Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) raised few questions toward jpeg compression that degrades image."
2375776,21349,11104,Object-based classification of multi-sensor optical imagery to generate terrain surface roughness information for input to wind risk simulation,2007,"Geoscience Australia is conducting a series of national risk assessments for a range of natural hazards such as severe winds. The impact of severe wind varies considerably between equivalent structures located at different sites due to local roughness of the upwind terrain, shielding provided by upwind structures and topographic factors. Terrain surface roughness information is a critical spatial input to generate wind multipliers. It is generally the first spatial field to be evaluated, as it is utilised in both the generation of the terrain and topographic wind multiplier. Landsat imagery was employed to generate a terrain surface roughness product for six major metropolitan areas across Australia. It was necessary to investigate the applicability of multi-sensor approaches to generate a regional/national terrain surface roughness map based on the Australian/New Zealand wind loading standard (AS/NZS 1170.2). This paper discusses the methodology that developed a procedure to derive terrain surface roughness from various multi-source satellite images. MODIS, Landsat, and IKONOS imagery were acquired (from 12 September - 26 November 2002) covering a significant portion of the New South Wales, Australia. An object-based image segmentation and classification technique was tested for seven bands of MODIS, six bands of Landsat Thematic Mapper, and four bands of IKONOS. Eleven terrain categories were identified using this technique which achieved classification accuracies of 79% and 93% over metropolitan (Sydney) and rural/urban areas respectively. It was revealed that the object-based image classification enhances the quality of the terrain product compared to traditional spectral- based maximum likelihood classification methods. To further improve the derivation of terrain roughness classification results, an integrated textural-spectral analysis merged Synthetic Aperture Radar and optical datasets provided in a study by [1]. A comparison with results derived from textural-spectral classification showed considerable improvement over the results from earlier classification techniques."
1760541,21349,11104,Spatial and temporal analysis of land cover change of the slope land in whole Taiwan Island,2005,"Taiwan Island is of mountainous with high density of population concentrated on a narrow belt of western plain. Human activities are pushing to move toward hillside and even mountains after an overdeveloping of flat plain. These include local community, agricultural zone, golf course, and road network, among others. The competition of land use with nature leads to landscape change to dramatic degree. The complex geological setting of is prone to landslide and soil erosion triggered by torrent storms if soil and water conversation are not well cared. The 921 Great Earthquake further made the soil even more vulnerable to slide and collapse. This has been seen from floods in 2004 which caused large scale damages in middle Taiwan. Hence, monitoring of hillside change becomes critical for effective and efficient land management. These changes are of spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of land cover changes detecting by SPOT images from two years of continuous observations and monitoring, with ancillary data from base maps, land use maps, GIS data, and DTM. All the data handling and analysis are through a GIS system. To assess the detection accuracy, a total of well distributed 206 samples from the whole island are selected for verification. Those changed areas are then analyzed in terms of occurrence frequency associated with location and time. Spatially, the occurrence frequency is high for slope between 15%-30% with altitude of around 1500m. The occurrence frequency was also dependent on the geological risk sites and strongly related to landslide-prone sites. Preliminary, it was found that the correlation between space and time is weak. Longer observation in time may be necessary and is undergoing."
1940608,21349,11104,Evaluation of integrating the invasive species forecasting system to support national park service decisions on fire management activities and invasive plant species control.,2007,"The USGS and NASA, in conjunction with Colorado State University, George Mason University and other partners, have developed the Invasive Species Forecasting System (ISFS), a flexible tool that capitalizes on NASA's remote sensing resource to produce dynamic habitat maps of invasive terrestrial plant species across the United States. In 2006 ISFS was adopted to generate predictive invasive habitat maps to benefit noxious plant and fire management teams in three major National Park systems: The Greater Yellowstone Area (Yellowstone / Grand Tetons National Parks), Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, and interior Alaskan (between Denali, Gates of The Arctic and Yukon-Charley). One of the objectives of this study is to explore how the ISFS enhances decision support apparatus in use by National Park management teams. The first step with each park system was to work closely with park managers to select top-priority invasive species. Specific species were chosen for each study area based on management priorities, availability of observational data, and their potential for invasion after fire disturbances. Once focal species were selected, sources of presence/absence data were collected from previous surveys for each species in and around the Parks. Using logistic regression to couple presence/absence points with environmental data layers, the first round of ISFS habitat suitability maps were generated for each National Park system and presented during park visits over the summer of 2006. This first engagement provided a demonstration of what the park service can expect from ISFS and initiated the ongoing dialog on how the parks can best utilized the system to enhance their decisions related to invasive species control. During the park visits it was discovered that separate expert opinion maps would provide a valuable baseline to compare against the ISFS model output. Opinion maps are a means of spatially representing qualitative knowledge into a quantitative two-dimensional map. Furthermore, our approach combines the qualitative expert opinion habitat maps with the quantitative ISFS habitat maps in a difference map that shows where the two maps agree and disagree. The objective of the difference map is to help focus future field sampling and improve model results. This paper presents a demonstration of the habitat, expert opinion, and difference map for Yellowstone National Park."
2108752,21349,11104,Fusion of MeRIS and ETM images for coastal water monitoring,2007,"Ocean colour monitoring is usually based on optical remote sensing with spatial resolutions around 1 km. This spatial scale is available with such sensors as NOAA-AVHRR,POLDER or SeaWiFS, which cover one to several thousand kilometers in a single swath and providing very short revisit periods. The MeRIS sensor, launched on board ENVISAT in 2002, was designed for sea colour observation, with a 300 meter spatial resolution, 15 programmable spectral bands and a 3 day revisit period. Tree hundred meter is a high resolution for an oceanographic sensors, but it is still too rough for coastal water monitoring, where physical and biological phenomena require better spatial resolution [1]. On the opposite, multispectral Landsat ETM images offer a suitable spatial resolution, but have only 4 spectral bands in the visible and near infrared spectrum, allowing poor spectral characterization. A few years ago, in order to combine the spectral resolution of MeRIS and the spatial resolution of Landsat ETM,we had implemented a merging method proposed by Zhukov et al. [2]. Before the launch of ENVISAT, we applied this method to simulated MeRIS images [3]. MeRIS was launched in March 2002 and has been providing images since June 2002. This method is now applied to real MeRIS images. Two product levels are considered. Level 1b contains radiance measurements at the top of the atmosphere for the calibrated and geocoded fifteen (15) MeRIS bands. Level 2 contains normalized surface reflectance and several geophysical and biophysical parameters such as algal pigment index, suspended sediment,Rayleigh-corrected vegetation indices, aerosol type, cloud albedo. The method was tested for radiance (level lb) and reflectance (level 2) over a coastal area of approximately 30times30 km 2  located around the Thau lagoon (southern France)."
2350081,21349,11104,Vulnerability assessment of the mountain-basin system in the northern tianshan mountains,2007,"Mountain-basin system (MBS) is the basic pattern of natural heterogeneity and regionalization in North-western China, and its big extent, multi-Layer and regular complex of terrestrial ecosystems in Northern Tianshan Mountains, Xinjiang, China, is the basin and frame to form this kind of pattern. To support regional sustainable development both on theory and practice, more and more vulnerability assessments became comprehensive studies by combining the ecosystem with socioeconomic system. Based on the vulnerability meaning that was composed of impact and adaptive ability, a vulnerability assessment on fifteen counties in the northern Tianshan Mountains was presented in this paper. The ecosystem services changing to land use/cover change (LUCC) was regarded as impact. Based on fourteen indexes from resource holding, society and economy development data, the adaptive ability was evaluated by using various methods and means such as AHP (the analytic hierarchy process), fuzzy comprehensive judging model, LUCC data and GIS. The impact was divided into four grades and the adaptive capacity three grades. And the fifteen counties were divided into five grades under the certain assessment principles, and the higher grade meant more vulnerability. Results showed that: The first grade included Usu City and Changji City. The second included Hutubi County, Miquan County, Fukang City, Jimsar County, Qitai County and Mori Kazak Autonomous County. Karamay City and Urumqi City were in the third grade, the fourth grade was composed of Kuytun City and Shawan County, and Jinghe County, Shihezi City and Manas County fell into the fifth grade. Vulnerability assessment results reflected both eco-environment change and socio-economic development level, which were the key references to ecological restoration and industry structural adjustment. It is necessary to make great efforts to carry out relevant counter-measures and decrease vulnerability, which would benefit the sustainable development of this kind of typical terrestrial ecosystem complex of MBS in North-western China, and additionally other similar areas."
1461012,21349,11104,"Towards high-precision flood mapping: Multi-temporal SAR/InSAR data, Bayesian inference, and hydrologic modeling",2015,"High-resolution flood mapping is an essential step in the monitoring and prevention of inundation hazard, both to gain insight into the processes involved in the generation of flooding events, and from the practical point of view of the precise assessment of inundated areas, useful e.g. in the case of post-event recovery and insurance indemnity assessments. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data present several favourable characteristics for flood mapping, such as their relative insensitivity to the meteorological conditions during acquisitions, thanks to the use of microwaves as sensing radiation, as well as the possibility of acquiring imagery independently of solar illumination, thanks to the active nature of the radar sensors. The Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR constellation is particularly useful in this respect, because it allows image sequences of flooding events to be built up with short revisit times. The acquisition of several images before, during and after the event often allow a reconstruction of the flooding dynamics. Moreover, they help in interpreting the backscatter signatures of different land cover types, reducing uncertainties about the actual presence of water, which can be seriously misleading, especially over agricultural areas [1, 2]. Finally, when acquisitions are made from the same geometry, with short repeat intervals, SAR interferometry (InSAR) observables, such as the coherence or the differential InSAR phase can be exploited as additional information layers. The favorable characteristics of these next-generation sensors have been exploited by a number of researchers worldwide [3, 4, 5] to improve performances of flood mapping approaches. Recently, our group [6, 2] has used high-resolution CSK radar images for flood mapping exploiting both the intensity and the interferometric coherence, with promising results. Nevertheless, additional information can be used to improve flood detection. In case of flooding, distance from the river, terrain elevation, hydrologic information or some combination of these data can add useful information that leads to a better performance in flood detection."

The launch of NASA's Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission in 2015 promises to provide new passive global measurements of soil moisture and surface freeze/thaw state at fixed crossing times and spatial resolutions of ∼30 km. With the failure of the SMAP radar there exists a need for measurements of soil moisture on much smaller spatial scales and arbitrary diurnal times for SMAP validation, precision agriculture, evaporation and transpiration studies of boundary layer heat transport, and tundra thaw studies. The Lobe Differencing Correlation Radiometer (LDCR) provides a means of mapping soil moisture on spatial scales as small as several meters (i.e., the height of the platform). Compared with various other proposed methods of validation based on either in situ measurements or existing airborne sensors suitable for manned aircraft deployment, the integrated design of the LDCR on a lightweight small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) is capable of providing sub-watershed (∼km scale) coverage at very high spatial resolution (∼15 m) suitable for scaling scale studies. This sUAS, the Tempest, flies at very low operator cost compared to manned aircraft. To demonstrate the LDCR several flights had been performed during a field experiment at the Canton Oklahoma Soilscape site on September 8th and 9th, 2015. These tests were flown at 25–35 m altitude to obtain differing spatial resolutions. The LDCR brightness temperature and soil moisture mapping algorithm will be analyzed, and scientific intercomparisons of LDCR, SMAP and SMOS data along with situ measurements will be presented."
2364587,21349,11104,"Synergic use of EO, NWP and ground based measurements for the mitigation of vapour artefacts in SAR interferometry",2011,"Spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a well established technique useful in many land applications, such as tectonic movements, landslide monitoring and digital elevation model extraction. One of its major limitation is the atmospheric effect, and in particular the high water vapour spatial and temporal variability which introduces an unknown delay in the signal propagation. This paper describes the general approach and some results achieved in the framework of an ESA funded project devoted to the mapping of the water vapour with the aim to mitigate its effect in InSAR applications. Ground based (microwave radiometers, radiosoundings, GPS) and spaceborne observations (AMSR-E, MERIS, MODIS) of columnar water vapour were compared with Numerical Weather Prediction model runs in Central Italy during a 15-day experiment. A dense network of GPS receivers was deployed close to Como, in Northern Italy, to complement the operational network in order to derive Zenith Total Delay as well as Slant Delay which can support InSAR processing. A comparison with Atmospheric Phase Screens (APS) derived from a sequence of Envisat multi pass interferometric acquisitions processed using the Permanent Scatters technique on the two test sites has been also performed. The acquired experimental data and their comparison give a valuable idea of what can be done to gather information on water vapour, which, besides InSAR applications, plays a fundamental role in weather prediction and radio propagation studies. The work has been carried out in the framework of an ESA funded project, named “Mitigation of Electromagnetic Transmission errors induced by Atmospheric Water Vapour Effects” (METAWAVE). This paper presents the general approach an the various methodologies exploited in the project, together with the overall intercomparison of the results. In deep details on the comparison with the InSAR APS maps derived by the PS technique, as well as on GPS receiver processing and water vapour tomography are reported in two companion papers."

NASA and NOAA share responsibility for CLARREO. The NOAA component involves the continuity of measurements of incident solar irradiance and Earth energy budget by flying the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) sensors that were removed from the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The NASA portion involves the measurement of spectrally resolved thermal IR and reflected solar radiation at high absolute accuracy. Coupled with measurements from on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) receivers, these measurements will provide a long- term benchmarking data record for the detection, projection, and attribution of changes in the climate system. In addition, the SI traceable radiances will provide a source of absolute calibration for a wide range of visible and infrared (IR) Earth observing sensors, greatly increasing their value for climate monitoring. CLARREO is identified as one of the four highest priority missions in the Decadal Survey. There is tremendous value in starting these key new climate measurements as soon as possible. NASA is implementing a systematic approach to resolving the remaining scientific and technological challenges for CLARREO. In particular, clear mission requirements that maximize the benefit for using these data to improve climate prediction are needed to ensure that NASA's performance objectives are met, future costs are contained, and delays are minimized This presentation will focus on on-going activities involved with the planning and implementation of the NASA portion of CLARREO. We will review the scientific objectives of CLARREO, possible mission configurations, and the potential impacts on climate science that the CLARREO data will provide."
2967982,21349,11104,An interpretation of underwater LiDAR waveforms based on a modified Weibull probability distribution function,2016,"One important research topic in marine optics and active remote sensing is the study of spatial distribution of inherent optical properties (IOPs) in 3-D and at very small scales (i.e., ten to hundredth of mm). The understanding of micro-patchiness has many useful implications in ecology [1], ocean color inversion based on satellite and airborne platforms [2], and improvement of underwater image processing [3]. Here a Fine Structure Underwater Imaging LiDAR (LIght Detection and Range) system (FSUIL) [4] was evaluated for investigating spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water optical components. Each impulse function measured by FSUIL is influenced by the source-detector configuration and by the signal attenuation due to changes on inherent optical properties (IOPs). Thus, for a fixed LiDAR system geometry and a complete characterization of the PMT response, IOPs may be retrieved from FSUIL waveforms. For this task, each raw waveform was simulated based on four shape parameters (i.e., slope, scale, amplitude, and noise baseline, hereafter P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively) derived from a modified Weibull probability distribution function (MW). Unlike other empirical models, MW estimates may be influenced by multiple scattering and symmetry of main backscattering peak. By assuming a constant LiDAR system configuration, it is expected that P1 increases (i.e., more symmetrical or less skewed Gaussian shape) as multiple scattering is added to the total signal arriving to the detector. The parameter P2 is linked to the width of the Gaussian function and is expected to increase as P2 increases. The parameter P3 relates to the kurtosis of the probability distribution function and is expected to mainly vary with the contribution of retro-reflected and forward-reflected photons after the first and second collision, respectively. A final parameter extracted from MW simulations is P4, a variable associated to the signal ‘offset’."

These data promotes multidisciplinary research in the circumpolar regions and can be instrumental in furthering our understanding of the Earth as a System. The International Polar Year in 2007 (IPY-4) presents unprecedented opportunities for integrated circumpolar research and for education outreach to a wide audience ranging from preschoolers through high end researchers, defined by NASA as the ''pipeline''. We foresee a world-wide participation which improve science competence and citizen awareness of the importance of the Polar Regions. Opportunities for integrating native knowledge of the indigenous residents of the Arctic is an essential component of IPY programs. Acquisition of reliable ground truth data in support of remote sensing of geophysical and geochemical variables are essential, especially with broad long-term coverage in the Polar Regions. In the United States NASA has developed a strategy for long-term monitoring of some key parameters needed to bring us closer to the answers we need regarding climate change and its relation to social systems. This technology consists of a group of six satellites that can make a suite of earth observations referred to as the ''A-Train''. Data from this group of polar orbiting satellites, as well as from the Orbital Carbon Observatory (OCO), and older Quikscat and new Seawinds radar missions, provide focus for an education program based not only on the acquisition of polar data but also on how these data correlate with global observations. This work presents strategies and recommendations for streamlining an effective educational outreach program in the IPY-4.

Yearly, several landslides occur during heavy monsoon rainfall in Kelantan river basin, Peninsular Malaysia, which are obviously connected to geological structures and topographical features of the region. In this study, the recently launched Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), remote sensing data were used to map geologic structural and topographical features in the Kelantan river basin for identification of high potential risk and susceptible zones for landslides and flooding areas. A ScanSAR and two fine mode dual polarization level 3.1 images cover Kelantan state were processed for comprehensive analysis of major geological structures and detailed characterizations of lineaments, drainage patterns and lithology at both regional and district scales. Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colour-composite was applied to different polarization channels of PALSAR-2 data to extract variety of geological information. Directional convolution filters were applied to the data for identifying linear features in particular directions and edge enhancement in the spatial domain. The analysis of the data indicate that many of flooded areas were associated with high potential risk zones for hydro-geological hazards such as wetlands, urban areas, floodplain scroll, meander bend, dendritic and sub-dendritic drainage patterns, which are located in flat topography regions. Numerous landslide points were located in rectangular drainage system that associated with topographic slope of metamorphic and Quaternary rock units. Geo-hazard mitigation programmes could be conducted in the landslide recurrence regions and flooded areas for reducing natural catastrophes leading to loss of financial investments and death in the Kelantan river basin."
1692838,21349,11104,Multiresolution fusion in remotely sensed images: Use of Gibbs prior and PSO optimization,2010,"In this paper, we propose a model based approach for multi-resolution fusion of remotely sensed images. We obtain a high spatial resolution (HR) and high spectral resolution multi-spectral (MS) image using a high spatial resolution Panchromatic (Pan) image and a low spatial resolution (LR) MS image. This problem is ill-posed since we need to predict the missing high resolution pixels in each of the MS images and requires proper regularization in order to get better solution. Each of the low spatial resolution MS images is modeled as aliased and noisy versions of the corresponding fused HR image. The decimation matrix entries are estimated using the Pan data and the MS image. The prior for regularization is obtained by modeling the texture of the HR MS image as a Markov random field (MRF) that can be expressed as a joint probability density function (PDF) using the Gibbs distribution (GD). In our work we make inference about this joint PDF by using the available high spatial resolution Pan image. As proposed in [1] a set of filters is chosen from a filter bank to obtain the estimates of the marginal distributions of the GD as the histograms of the filtered outputs. Our final cost function consists of a data fitting term and a prior term which is then minimized to obtain the high spatial and spectral resolution MS image. The process is repeated for each of the MS images. The optimization is done using Particle swarm optimization (PSO) which can be implemented in parallel mode in order to reduce the time complexity. The main advantages of our approach are: 1) It requires no registration between Pan and MS images; 2) The spectral distortion is minimum as we are not using the actual Pan digital numbers; 3) The method can be applied to the fusion of Pan and MS images captured at different times and using different sensors. The drawback of the proposed method is its time complexity as one cannot use fast optimization approaches for minimization. However, we have attempted to reduce the computational complexity by using PSO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on real satellite data captured by Quickbird satellite."

From 1997, the researchers began to pay more attention to ecosystem services of grassland. Yet so far. the studies of grassland ecosystem services still locus on classification, characterization and general economic valuation owing to the limitation of method and technology. and therefore lack the studies of, dynamic changes and spatial textures that could influence tile economic valuation directly. It should be very helpful to use RS and GIS to assess the ecosystem services. Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau with unique geographical and climate characteristics plays an important role at Asian level and even at global level. Grassland occupies the largest area anions the ecosystem types in Qinhai-Tibetan Plateau. Because many rivers originate from this region, the grassland as the main ecosystem is not only tile product material but also the ecological protection belt. The irrational utilization of grassland over past two decades had induced severe degradation and thus the structure and ecological function of the fragile ecosystem had been damaged seriously. So in order to understand the ecosystem services of grassland overall, dynamically, and spatially, this paper aims to evaluate the ecosystem services and their valuation of grassland in Qinghai-Tibeten Plateau based oil RS and GIS. We choose six types of ecosystem services and derive six indicators from talent. They include: (1) providing NPP, by indicator of NPP; (2) carbon sequestration and oxygen release, by indicators of carbon and oxygen: (3) holding water, by indicator of soil moisture;(4) conserving soil, by indicator of land cover; (5) meliorating soil, by indicator of NPP: (6) maintaining biology diversity, by indicator of biodiversity. Six indicators above are calculated firstly by using MODIS 1B data and their reconstruction. 1: 4, 000, 000 Chinese Resources and Environment Database; and secondly composed the physical value unit area of every type of ecosystem services. Thirdly, we attempt to revise tile economic value unit area of grassland ecosystem services in terms of the physical value unit area, and then integrated physical values and economic values are evaluated for six types of ecosystem services. The evaluation shows that the ecosystem services and their economic values change with physically geographical conditions. In general they decrease front the southcast to the northwest gradually which suggests the ecosystem services and their economic values should he estimated based oil the spatial differentiation law."

Among such data systems, this paper considers those that NASA develops and/or utilizes in order to fulfill one of its strategic objectives: Study Earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs. Such data systems are of various sizes and meet a variety of requirements. Some data systems constitute NASA's Core Capabilities, and provide the basic infrastructure for robust and reliable data capture, processing, archiving and distributing a set of data products to a large and diverse user community. The Earth Observing Data and Information System (EOSDIS) is one example of such a system. Another class of data systems, constituting Community Capabilities, provides specialized and innovative services to data users and/or research products offering new scientific insight. Such systems are generally supported by NASA through peer reviewed competition. This paper focuses on the community capabilities including projects under the Research, Education and Applications Solutions Network (REASoN). Well-established goals and metrics measuring progress relative to those goals are essential to assess effectiveness of any systems, programs or organizations. Detailed metrics are needed by system managers to observe performance and plan improvements. Metrics of interest to program managers tend to be oriented towards the utility of the systems in meeting strategic goals, and sizes of communities served. The metrics must be tailored to the types of community capabilities. For example, systems providing data and those providing services need to be assessed using different metrics. Metrics aggregated across systems are of interest in measuring program effectiveness supporting NASA'a science, applied science, and education objectives."

Current satellite systems typically require human intervention to respond to triggers from dissimilar sensor systems. Additionally, satellite ground services often need to be coordinated days or weeks in advance. Finally, the boundaries between the various sensor systems that make up such a Sensor Web are defined by such things as link delay & connectivity, data & error rate asymmetry, data reliability, quality of service provisions, and trust, complicating autonomous operations. Over the past ten years, researchers from NASA's Glenn Research Center, General Dynamics, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), Cisco, Universal Space Networks (USN), the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Naval Research Laboratory, the DoD Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office, and others have worked collaboratively to develop a “virtual” mission operations capability. Called “VMOC” (Virtual Mission Operations Center), this new capability allows cross-system queuing of dissimilar mission unique systems through the use of a common security scheme and published application programming interfaces (APIs). Collaborative VMOC demonstrations over the last several years have supported the standardization of spacecraft to ground interfaces needed to reduce costs, maximize space effects to the user, and allow the generation of new tactics, techniques and procedures that lead to responsive space employment."

The effort began by identifying and prototyping technologies which enabled the rapid gathering and dissemination of both space-based and ground sensor data and data products for the purpose of flood disaster management. This was followed by an international collaboration to build small portions of the identified system which was prototyped during the past few years during the flood seasons which occurred in the February through May timeframe of 2010 and 2011 with further prototyping to ongoing in 2012. The pilot effort has been fostered by CEOS to facilitate international efforts to promote satellite sensor data interoperability. In particular, the group has been making use of a technology effort call SensorWeb being developed at NASA which leverages Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to facilitate various satellite and ground sensor interoperability.

2017462,21349,11104,A novel method for filling the depressions in massive DEM data,2007,"It has been universally recognized by the previous researches that depressions in DEM data are the major obstacle of determining hydrologic flow directions, so numerous methods were proposed to address this problem. However, when massive DEM data, such as SRTM and GTOPO30, become available through internet, the conventional approaches are too time- consuming and inefficient in dealing with such massive data for hydrologic analyses. A new innovative approach, unlike all existing methods that process DEM data straightforward without utilizing the topographic features implied in them, was proposed in this study to improve the DEM-processing efficiency. The new approach has two steps: first, classify the initial DEM data into eight groups according to the elevation values using the quantile classification method, and set each category cell values to its quantile and store them in a transient matrix. Second, scan the transient matrix from the minimum category to the maximum one, restore its initial value if its initial value is larger than or equal to its neighbors', else set its value to the minimum of its neighbors' if its quantile is larger than its neighbor's, and repeat this process until all the depressions are filled. Furthermore, unlike the traditional method, which have to scan all the DEM cells in each loop, the new one only scan the data needed to be further processed by storing their location information into two stacks. As a result, the total cells and scanning times are dramatically decreased due to stack's nature of first in last out, and the location information of depressions is all stored in one of the two stacks, which facilitate the subsequent hydrologic analysis. DEMs of various sizes were used for testing and evaluating the new method. The results show the new method is thousands of times faster than the famous Jenson and Domingue's (1988) method and is over seven times faster than Planchon and Darboux's on average The new algorithm is fully detailed and pseudo-codes are provided in this paper."
1129697,21349,11104,Quantifying the results of wind and rain on ifsar tree height estimation,2010,"The horizontal and vertical (3D) structure of Earth's forested ecosystems are of great significance to their ecological functioning and societal uses. An IfSAR approach is one methodology whereby a forest's structure and height in particular can be successfully estimated. Critical to the successful estimation is a high correlation between multiple SAR images. Regardless of a forest's location on the Earth, wind and precipitation can significantly alter a forest's appearance to a SAR system operating in either the L or C bands and so too decrease this necessary correlation. In order to investigate and quantize the decorrelation induced by factors such as wind and rain, we have developed a model for the repeat-pass interferometric SAR response of a forest including the application of a wind field and / or a rain storm. The simulation consists of multiple interconnected parts including the generation of fractal tree geometries, a wind simulator to apply apply variable wind forces to the generated trees, an electromagnetic model to allow us to calculate a Single Look Complex value for the SAR return of the combined target, an image forming technique based on antenna array theory, and an image processing algorithm. Results present polarmetric coherence as a function of platform look angle, wind speed, and moisture content. An important feature of this research is the usage of a physically based realistic wind model that is based on measurements of wind effects on trees as well as realistic models of fluid flow and simple harmonic branch segment resonators. Allowing branches to bend and move out of the plane of the incident wind field enables our model to capture numerous features of a physical tree blowing in the wind. This realistic model is necessary for a realistic simulation of the effects that wind has on a given InSAR imaging system as expressed in this study by the interferometric coherence."
718369,21349,11104,Water for Food Production - Opportunities for Sustainable Land-Water Management using Remote Sensing,2008,"Adaptation to global climate and environmental change in the context of the water-food nexus will require both understanding the nature of change of freshwater resources (e.g. where does precipitation fall, and how much there is?), and the engineering of regional strategies to manage water harvesting and water use (natural storage in aquifers and in the critical soil zone, and manmade alternatives including land-use/land-cover manipulation such as rainfed agriculture), leading to maximal resilience. In a world of increasing population, achieving and maintaining food security is a fundamental challenge for human development in the 21st century. Food security and sustainable agriculture go hand-in hand. The basis for sustainable agriculture is hydroecological resilience, which implies the Integrated Management of Land and Water Resources (a land-use decision is a water decision, Malin Falkenmark 2001). IMLWR requires systematic monitoring of the pathways by which joint space-time organization patterns of landform, precipitation, recharge (groundwater), distribution and storage (runoff) interact, and ultimately impact the so-called green water stocks critical for crop production (i.e. soil moisture in the unsaturated zone that is directly available to meet vegetation photosynthetic needs). IMLWR is ideally suited for a remote-sensing based monitoring and analysis framework. Here, an interpretive study is presented using a wide variety of remote sensing data (clouds, rainfall, and vegetation) from multiple satellite platforms to assess the condition of freshwater stocks (rainfall) and hydroecological resilience in NW India, specifically the state of Punjab. Finally, the notion of hydrometeorological audit is proposed as a strategy for anticipating modes of failure in water resource systems, and to inform policy in the context of sustainable land-water management and food production."

Its objective is to provide global and frequent soil moisture (SM) and sea surface salinity (SSS) maps. SMOS' single payload is the Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) sensor, an L-band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer. To help in the retrieval process, auxiliary data will be used in combination with the brightness temperatures measured by MIRAS. In the salinity retrieval case, the main data sources are the sea state, the sea surface temperature, and the salinity values (even at low density sampling), which would allow a more accurate retrieval and a better quality product. One of the obvious candidates of auxiliary data is the ARGO buoy array. In this study, two different algorithms are proposed to use the ARGO salinity measurements in the retrieval procedure and provide coherent SSS maps with these measurements: The first algorithm is referred to as the external brightness temperature calibration [1] and aims at eliminating the bias introduced by the instrument errors and the image reconstruction process at the brightness temperature level; The second algorithm is referred to as the external salinity calibration, and aims at correcting the biases introduced by the retrieval algorithm [2] as well, due to an imperfect dielectric constant model and an imperfect sea state parameterization in the emissivity model. Using the SMOS End-to-end Performance Simulator (SEPS) [3] as a source of SMOS-like brightness temperatures and the ARGO data as the source of auxiliary parameters, a series of simulations have been performed both in open ocean, and in coastal regions using a SMOS Level 2 Processor Simulator (L2PS) developed by the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC). The performances of both algorithms are compared, and simulation results are presented and discussed."
2194848,21349,11104,MODIS seasonal and inter-annual responses of semiarid ecosystems to drought in the Southwest U.S.A,2004,"High temporal frequency observations with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra Earth Observing System platform offer unique opportunities to study climate- and anthropogenic-induced land transformations in the temporal domain. Shifts in vegetation type and physiognomies alter biologic activity and responses to climate patterns in unpredictable ways. Increases in insect populations (e.g. bark beetle) and fire associated with a multi-year drought in the Southwest U.S.A have greatly impacted the health of its native ecosystems from pinyon-juniper, Ponderosa pine, and mixed conifer forests to the savanna, grassland, and desert shrub ecosystems. In this study, MODIS time series data combined with AVIRIS overflights were analyzed for detection and evaluation of the causes, severity, and extent of changes in ecosystem health. We used the 16-day MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) product and a normalized difference water index (NDWI) to analyze the seasonal, inter-annual, and spatial patterns of vegetation activity over a wide range of land cover types across eco-climatic and elevational gradients and through the winter and variable monsoon rainfall `pulses'. The temporal dynamics of vegetation were found to be highly sensitive to both anthropogenic and climatic forcings found in the semiarid and arid Southwest with seasonal and inter-annual profiles varying markedly with land cover type and land surface disturbance (e.g., drought, insects). All land cover types and eco-climatic gradients from desert shrub to montane forest were significantly affected by the drought, with grasslands most impacted. Tree mortality variability could also be assessed and we found that combined MODIS-AVIRIS data offer the potential of ecosystem health and risk assessment"
2516482,21349,11104,A two-parameter exponential function approach to simply and accurately characterize spatial regime of topographic index for land-surface parameterizations,2007,"The concept of topographic index (TI), for characterizing the likely distribution of variable source areas within a watershed, has been successfully incorporated into some land-surface processes parameterizations and climate models. Representing the spatial distribution regime of TI accurately and simply is a crucial issue for those topography-based land- atmosphere interactions studies. In this paper, a simple but effective method, named as two-parameter exponential function, was developed to solve such problem. Since the important runoff generation mechanism occurs chiefly in lowland areas of a catchment or a simulating grid unit, it is not necessary to accurately capture the distribution where the TI values are less than the mean TI value (corresponding to upland areas). As a special case of the three-parameter gamma distribution, the two- parameter exponential function is used to fit only the part of the actual discrete CDF where TI is larger than its mean value so that it performs better than the previous gamma distribution does. In this exponential function, two significant parameters, the maximum fractional saturated area (F max ) and the exponential coefficient (Cs) should be determined by topographic characteristics. So we investigated the relationships of these two important parameters with the mean value of TI, lambda m . Fortunately, it was found that the value of F max  (0.35-0.55) can be derived directly from actual CDF curve, and the exponential coefficient, Cs (0.58-0.68), can also be obtained from a simple equation of Cs =0.04/lm +0.21. Fifty 0.5deg X 0.5deg DEM blocks of 90- m resolution, which were chosen randomly to represent a wide range of terrain complexity, were clipped from STRM DEM3 datasets covering the central part of China to verify the validity of this exponential function approach. The experimental results suggested that the two-parameter exponential function agrees fairy well with the actual cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves in lowland part of those grid cells located at mountainous areas, where the general three-parameter gamma distribution fails to fit the discrete distribution of TI, as well as at flat areas. The two-parameter exponential function approach, which can accurately and simply characterizing spatial regime of TI in lowland areas under different topographic conditions, improves the expression of fractional saturated area and the parameterization of topography-based land-surface processes."
2282684,21349,11104,Statistical agreement between observed microwave satellite radiances and NWP hydrometeors including hexagonal plates and rosettes,2005,"Accurate global observation of precipitation for all latitudes and seasons, and for all land, sea, and ice surfaces remains an elusive goal. One major obstacle to progress is lack of reliable global ground truth on horizontal and vertical scales consistent with those observed by satellite. For example, radar and scatter-dependent radiometric techniques respond to precipitation aloft, not on the ground, and can be unduly sensitive to large hydrometeors. On the other hand, rain gauges are excessively sensitive to local rainfall inhomogeneities and wind, and well-instrumented sites are rare. This paper quantitatively compares satellite observations with mesoscale numerical weather predictions of microwave brightness temperatures at those millimeter wavelengths most sensitive to hydrometeor structures and to the physics of precipitation. Only such models with high horizontal and vertical resolution allow comparisons of different sensors in detail. A Mesoscale Model, MM5, and a forward radiance program, TBSCAT, have been used to simulate radiances that would be observed from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A and AMSU-B) aboard the NOAA-16 satellite for twenty-four globally representative storm systems, including /spl sim/28,200 AMSU-A and 255,640 AMSU-B footprints, spanning a year. Good agreement has been obtained between histograms of coincident MM5-simulated and observed AMSU-A and AMSU-B radiances by adjusting ice parameter values in TBSCAT. Ice parameter values are consistent with the scattering for ice habits observed aloft, as computed using a Discrete Dipole Approximation program, DDSCAT6.1. These results suggest the potential use of MM5 as a rich new statistical form of ground-truth that will permit development of better precipitation estimators and improved understanding of precipitation itself, particularly in the more problematic areas of the globe."
2501367,21349,11104,Generating a long-term land data record from the AVHRR and MODIS Instruments,2007,"The goal of NASA's land long term data record (LTDR) project is to produce a consistent long term data set from the AVHRR and MODIS instruments for land climate studies. The project will create daily surface reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products at a resolution of 0.05deg, which is identical to the climate modeling grid (CMG) used for MODIS products from EOS Terra and Aqua. Higher order products such as burned area, land surface temperature, albedo, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction, leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR), will be created. The LTDR project will reprocess global area coverage (GAC) data from AVHRR sensors onboard NOAA satellites by applying the preprocessing improvements identified in the AVHRR Pathfinder II project and atmospheric and BRDF corrections used in MODIS processing. The preprocessing improvements include radiometric in-flight vicarious calibration for the visible and near infrared channels and inverse navigation to relate an Earth location to each sensor instantaneous field of view (IFOV). Atmospheric corrections for Rayleigh scattering, ozone, and water vapor are undertaken, with aerosol correction being implemented. The LTDR also produces a surface reflectance product for channel 3 (3.75 mum). Quality assessment (QA) is an integral part of the LTDR production system, which is monitoring temporal trends in the AVHRR products using time-series approaches developed for MODIS land product quality assessment. The land surface reflectance products have been evaluated at AERONET sites. The AVHRR data record from LTDR is also being compared to products from the PAL (pathfinder AVHRR land) and GIMMS (global inventory modeling and mapping studies) systems to assess the relative merits of this reprocessing vis-a-vis these existing data products. The LTDR products and associated information can be found at http://ltdr.nascom.nasa.gov/ltdr/ ltdr.html."
1791610,21349,11104,Automatic extraction and cartographic generalization of settlement feature from SPOT imagery,2005,"s—The purpose of the paper was to find the solution to automatic acquisition and renewal of settlement feature from SPOT imagery. The solution consists of the following: one is feature extraction from imagery, the other is the cartographic generalization of the extracted features. Firstly, the extraction of residential area from SPOT image based on a decision tree model in combination with the analysis of characteristics of settlement and other land-use types on the image was discussed. Secondly, In terms of characteristics of extracted residential patches, a series of structuring elements were designed to remove the holes within patches, which were generated by complicated pixel grouping. Structuring elements were also designed for the morphological generalization of patch's corners and sides. Finally, based on point cluster simplification, a new method for residential patch selection was adopted, in which not only the requirements of selection count, spatial relationship between patches and their density contrast could be satisfied, but also the geometric feature of patches were considered. The result showed that the method discussed in the paper could be applied to rapid automatic extraction of vector geographical information on rural settlement and the information could meet the requirements of cartography. make cartographical generalization. Two steps must be done in the generalization of the settlement patches. One is the morphological generalization of settlement patch edge; the other is the selection of patches according to the scale, patch size and their spatial distribution (3-6). In this study, Jiangning county of Nanjing in China was taken as a case study area. Part of the test area is shown in Fig.4. The test area is typical of low mountains and hills and of complicated landscape. The image data of January 21, 1999 of SPOT-4 (XI) was used, which has 4 bands in total, two visible bands B1 (0.50~0.59µm), B2(0.61~0.68µm), one infrared band B3(0.78~0.89µm)and one short-wave infrared band SWIR(1.58~1.75µm)."
2626635,21349,11104,Wind and wave measurements using complex ERS-2 SAR wave mode data,2000,"A global dataset of complex synthetic aperture (SAR) images is processed from wave mode raw data acquired by the ERS-2 satellite. Using these data, different algorithms for wind and wave measurements recently developed in view of future ENVISAT ASAR data are analyzed on a statistical basis. Different aspects of complex SAR wave mode processing with the DLR processor BSAR are discussed and global statistics of processing parameters are presented. Single-look complex (SLC) imagettes give the opportunity to apply multilook techniques in range as well as in azimuth. Such methods are used to reduce speckle noise or to analyze the time evolution of the ocean surface cross section during SAR integration time. A global analysis of different new algorithms for wind and ocean wave measurements, taking advantage of SLC data, is given. Wind speed is estimated with the azimuthal cross-correlation algorithm (CCA). As a modification of the existing CCA, range multilooking is used to deal with the speckle bias. Homogeneity of the imagettes is considered. Wind speed is derived from mean SAR image intensities taking into account wind direction (CMOD algorithm). Comparison with collocated ERS-2 scatterometer data shows reasonable agreement with the CCA and good agreement for the CMOD approach. Using imagettes instead of image power spectra allows us to study ocean surface features caused by natural slicks, sea ice, or atmospheric processes. The impact of these phenomena on SCAT measurements is considered. Cross spectral methods are used to derive the ocean wave propagation direction from complex imagettes on a global basis. Comparison with model data provided by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), Reading, U.K., shows good agreement."
1169118,21349,11104,Calibration of SMOS geolocation biases,2007,"The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission aims at observing two variables critical for a large scientific community, from biosphere dynamics to climate monitoring. The mission should also provide information on root zone soil moisture and vegetation and contribute to significant research in the field of the cryosphere. The original design, 2D interferometric radiometer at L-band, and principle of measurement makes SMOS a challenge at various technical levels. Moreover, stringent requirements on the estimated variables make the complete processing of SMOS data even more challenging. One of these requirements is concerned with the ability to accurately localize all the footprints of the instrument on the surface of the earth. Based on simulation and sensitivity studies with respect to the final retrieval of soil moisture, this accuracy requirement has been established so that the localization error on each footprint presents a zero mean and a standard deviation of 400 m. This high accuracy is mainly due to the need for knowledge of open water within a footprint, not to bias soil moisture estimation. This accuracy is highly challenging and unprecedented for sensors of this class and resolution. The on board devices that will help characterize the geolocation of the SMOS products include stellar sensor and gyroscopes, which can achieve an accuracy consistent with the requirements in terms of standard deviation. But the overall localization budget is also contaminated by an important bias, due to the mechanical deployment of the instrument antenna arms after launch, and to the launch shift that impacts all the alignments on the satellite (mechanical shift of stellar sensor due to shocks and vibrations, moisture desorption in mechanical brackets...). The purpose of this study is to characterize these biases, obviously inaccessible to on ground measurement and expected not to evolve once in orbit, so that they can be accounted for in the ground processing prior to initiate the soil moisture retrieval."
774279,21349,11104,Earth observing system (EOS) data and information system (EOSDIS) — evolution update and future,2007,"NASA develops and utilizes a variety of large and small scale data systems to meet its Earth science objectives. Generally, the data systems are considered Core Capabilities providing the basic infrastructure needed to capture data from space-borne instruments as well as process, archive and distribute science data products to the user community. The Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS) is an example of NASA's Core Capabilities. Another class of capabilities, which may be called Community Capabilities, is generally selected through peer review to support NASA's Earth science programs. Both Core and Community Capabilities are necessary not only to serve the basic needs of the broad and diverse community of over 200,000 users of NASA's Earth science data but also to improve and enhance the science insight for a variety of research and science applications. As information technology changes at a quick pace and new capabilities become readily available, users' expectations increase as well. Data systems' organizations need to be dynamic and adapt to these changes. While both Core and Community Capabilities must be adaptive, the pace at which adaptation occurs generally differs between the two. Core Capabilities typically have stricter operations and performance requirements serving a large community. These systems tend to be slower in changing whereas the Community Capabilities can be early adopters of new technologies since any impacts affect a much smaller community. Evolution of EOSDIS, based on a NASA-established vision for circa 2015 has been in implementation since early 2006. The vision emphasizes increased end-to-end data system efficiency and operability; increased data usability; improved support for end users; and decreased operations costs. Due to concurrent operations, the transition of operations to newer systems is being carried out incrementally. This paper provides a summary of the implementation, transition to operations and the lessons learned."
493172,21349,11104,A compact high-resolution radar for determining snow accumulation rates,2004,"Rising sea level has important humanitarian and economic implications. Scientists are rigorously investigating the contribution of glacial ice sheets to sea-level rise. Knowledge of the mass balance of the ice sheets is important in understanding their dynamics. The accumulation rate of snow on ice sheets is an important variable in determining this mass balance. The accumulation rate is currently determined using ice cores and pits. This is a tedious method to obtain coverage over the entire ice sheet due to the limited number of samples that can be acquired. The only practical means of obtaining coverage over a large area would be by means of remote sensing. We have developed a wideband radar to map the isochronous layers in the ice sheet This will help reduce the uncertainty associated with sparse sampling of the ice sheet. We built a compact FM-CW radar that operates from 500 to 2000 MHz with range resolution of about 10 cm. Both the transmitter and receiver were housed in a single Compact PCI chassis. We used a YIG oscillator to generate the FM signal. The performance of an FM-CW is usually degraded by the nonlinearity of the source. We linearized the sweep of the YIG oscillator by means of a phase-locked loop (PLL). We have successfully tested the radar in the lab and we will be performing tests during the 2004 summer field experiments at the Summit camp in Greenland. We successfully tested a connectorized version of this radar during the 2003 field experiments at the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) camp. We were able to map the internal layers up to a depth of about 150 m over a 5-km transect. We also conducted detailed snow pit studies at several spots over the transect for correlating the visually determined layers with the radar determined layers. We will present the radar design, laboratory test results of its performance, results from the experiments at Summit and a comparison of the radar data with information derived from ice cores and snow pits."
1905751,21349,11104,Study of estimating directional vegetation fractional cover using remote sensing method,2004,"As an important index of measuring vegetation's density, vegetation fractional cover (VFC) has been an important subject of vegetation remote sensing. It is useful not only in land use mapping and supervising environmental change but as a input parameter, it is of great significance for transpiration model and land surface temperature model. There are two factors that we must take into account when we retrieve VFC by means of remote sensing. One is land surface reflectivity and the other is vegetation spectrum. However, these two factors are all extremely influenced by vegetation structure, solar zenith angle and view angle, etc. So in some cases, we must consider the changes of VFC which are caused by the change of solar angle, view angle and vegetation itself. We call this VFC as directional vegetation cover. The study of directional VFC will improve the precision of relevant models and will contribute to multi-angle vegetation remote sensing. An intensive experiment was carried out in 2003 in YuCheng experimental station. In our experiment, directional digital pictures of maize with four distribution (north-south row, edge, center, equality) were required at five viewing angles of 45,60,90,120,135 from east horizontal direction by a digital camera. At the same time, vertical reflectance from nadir direction and leaf area index (LAI) was also required. Vertical vegetation covers were estimated by using the existing models. In contrast with the true values which were got from our digital pictures worked, we found the better model estimating vegetation fractional cover. In our work, because it was difficult in differentiating between shadowed vegetation and shadowed soil with traditional supervised classification method, the true VFC values were obtained from digital pictures which were disposed of by Adobe Photoshop and the absolute precision were limited within five percent In addition, we analyzed some influencing parameters of directional vegetation cover including LAI, view zenith angle and vegetation distribution. In a word, our study only was the primary study of directional vegetation cover. It still was affected by some other factors and needed further research"
2308732,21349,11104,Evaluation of the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index,2004,"The medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS), one of the payloads on Envisat, has fine spectral resolution, moderate spatial resolution and a three day repeat cycle. This makes MERIS a potentially valuable sensor for the measurement and monitoring of terrestrial environments at regional to global scales. The red edge, which results from an abrupt change in reflectance in red and near-infrared wavelength has a location that is related directly to the chlorophyll content of vegetation. A new index called the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) uses data in three red/NIR wavebands centred at 681.25 nm, 705 nm and 753.75 nm (bands 8, 9 and 10 in the MERIS standard band setting). The MTCI is easy to calculate and can be automated. Preliminary indirect evaluation using model, field and MERIS data suggested its sensitivity, to notably high values of chlorophyll content and its limited sensitivity to spatial resolution or atmospheric effects. As a result this index is now a standard level-2 product of the European Space Agency. For direct MTCI evaluation two different approaches were used. First, the MTCI/chlorophyll content relationship were determined using a chlorophyll content surrogate for sites in southern Vietnam and second, the MTCI/chlorophyll relationship was determined using actual chlorophyll content for sites in the New Forest, UK and for plots in the greenhouse. Forests in southern Vietnam were contaminated heavily with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. The contamination level was so high that it led to a long term decrease in chlorophyll content within forests that have long since regained full canopy cover. In this approach the amount of Agent Orange dropped on to the forest between 1965 and 1971 was used as a surrogate (inverse) for contemporary chlorophyll content and was related to current MTCI at selected forest sites. The resulting relationship was negative. Further per pixel investigation of the MTCI/Agent Orange concentration relationship is under way for large forest regions. In the second approach MTCI was related directly to chlorophyll content at two scales and the initial resulting relationships were positive. Further plans involve the evaluation of the MTCI at local, regional and eventually global scales"
1120045,21349,11104,High resolution D-INSAR measurement for land subsidence,2010,"TerraSAR-X is German first national remote sensing satellite. Compared to other European satellites, ERS-1/-2 and Envisat, TerraSAR-X data are more suitable for land subsidence monitoring due to its high resolution (strip-mode, 3 m) and short repeat acquisition cycle (11 days). It is well known, the major cause of the surface subsidence phenomenon is over-exploitation of groundwater, while the contribution of tectonic settlement was found to be very small. The traditional measurement method, differential leveling, can draw the spatial-temporal relationship between the real distribution of land subsidence and groundwater drawdown, their time series curves are similar, but the survey results shown the land subsidence centers don't overall match the groundwater depression cones, namely local deviations, and land subsidence always lags behind groundwater level decline, with different lag time at different sites. Some documents think that land subsidence centers shift from the corresponding groundwater depression cones to the sides with thicker accumulated clay layers and the shift strongly depends on the different physical properties of clay soils. In this paper, a study area of subsidence in the city of Taiyuan has been investigated using TerraSAR-X high resolution data and D-INSAR technique. In order to determine the accurate location and shape of each subsidence center, a time series of differential interferograms has been first generated and applied to preliminary location determination and rough subsidence rate estimation for each subsidence center, then the time series analysis of persistent scatterers including single point objects and highly coherent surface pieces for each subsidence center has been used for accurate positioning of subsidence center and precise subsidence rate estimation. In fact, the second step is a problem of parameter estimation based on a subsidence modeling. An important parameter, e.g. parameter limit estimation for phase or displacement rate must be preset in advance, this is done usually based on experience. In this paper, this parameter limit has been estimated through stacking a series of phase-unwrapped interferograms with corresponding time-weighted average. The results of the study using TerraSAR-X data for land subsidence measurement in Taiyuan represent that the high resolution TerraSAR-X interferometry may provide more details of the subsidence phenomenon, and help to determine the accurate location and shape of each subsidence center. In addition, the results of the study indicate that the misfit and shift of the subsidence center from groundwater drawdown measured by traditional leveling should be caused by inaccurate positioning of subsidence center, not by different thickness of the accumulated clay layers."
1890484,21349,11104,Spatiotriangulation with multisensor VIR/SAR images,2004,"The objectives of this research study was to evaluate the spatiotriangulation applied to multisensor satellite images, which enabled the simultaneous geometric processing of a large number of images and strips together to reduce the control point requirement. The spatiotriangulation is based on the three-dimensional physical models developed for multisensor images at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada and on a least squares block bundle adjustment process with orbital constraints. The spatiotriangulation was applied to 49 images in six blocks (Landsat-7 ETM+, panchromatic SPOT-4 HRV, multiband ASTER, multimode radar RADARSAT-1, and ERS-1) acquired over the Rocky Mountains, Canada, from different viewing/look angles. The first results of least squares block bundle adjustments showed that the same error residuals (around 20 m) were obtained with the different image blocks whether independently or simultaneously processed. In addition to ground control points (GCPs), elevation tie points (ETPs), with a known elevation value, instead of normal tie points were used in the overlaps because the viewing/look-angle differences of overlapping images were generally small (8/spl deg/). The second and most important results were related to simultaneous bundle adjustments of the largest master Landsat-7 block (600 km /spl times/ 500 km) using 25 GCPs in the two outer strips and the smallest slave block(s) using no GCP but only ETPs. The errors, verified by a large number of independent check points (ICPs) in the slave blocks, were between 15-35 m (1.5-2 resolutions), depending on the slave block. However, the combined image pointing and map errors of ICPs (25-30 m) are included in these 15-35-m error results, and the internal accuracy of the blocks should, thus, be better (around one resolution). The research study demonstrated, thus, the possibility to use the largest block with a reduced number of GCPs to simultaneously adjust single image(s)/strip(s) or smallest block(s) with only ETPs, and with no degradation in the accuracy."
2408611,21349,11104,GIFTS SM EDU data processing and algorithms,2007,"The geosynchronous imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (GIFTS) sensor module (SM) engineering demonstration unit (EDU) is a high resolution spectral imager designed to measure infrared (IR) radiances using a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS). The GIFTS instrument employs three focal plane arrays (FPAs), which gather measurements across the long-wave IR (LWIR), short/mid-wave IR (SMWIR), and visible spectral bands. The raw interferogram measurements are radiometrically and spectrally calibrated to produce radiance spectra, which are further processed to obtain atmospheric profiles via retrieval algorithms. This paper describes the processing algorithms involved in the calibration stage. The calibration procedures can be subdivided into three stages. In the pre-calibration stage, a phase correction algorithm is applied to the decimated and filtered complex interferogram. The resulting imaginary part of the spectrum contains only the noise component of the uncorrected spectrum. Additional random noise reduction can be accomplished by applying a spectral smoothing routine to the phase-corrected blackbody reference spectra. In the radiometric calibration stage, we first compute the spectral responsivity based on the previous results, from which, the calibrated ambient blackbody (ABB), hot blackbody (HBB), and scene spectra can be obtained. During the post-processing stage, we estimate the noise equivalent spectral radiance (NESR) from the calibrated ABB and HBB spectra. We then implement a correction scheme that compensates for the effect of fore-optics offsets. Finally, for off-axis pixels, the FPA off-axis effects correction is performed. To estimate the performance of the entire FPA, we developed an efficient method of generating pixel performance assessments. In addition, a random pixel selection scheme is designed based on the pixel performance evaluation."
1867926,21349,11104,An overview of the JERS-1 SAR Global Boreal Forest Mapping (GBFM) project,2004,"Boreal ecosystems play an essential role in global climate regulation. Forests constitute pools of terrestrial carbon and are generally considered as global sinks of atmospheric CO/sub 2/, contributing to attenuating the greenhouse effect. Large amounts of carbon are also stored in boreal lakes, bogs and wetlands, partially released as CH/sub 4/ and other trace gases to the atmosphere during the spring and summer months. Human activities in the forest zone are however reducing the size of the carbon pool and climate change is triggering shorter winters and earlier thaw onset, changing the natural equilibrium. Given its global importance, there is a need to map and monitor the boreal zone, and as the changes occur on all from local, regional to global scales, fine resolution information over vast areas is required. The Global Boreal Forest Mapping (GBFM) project is an international collaborative undertaking initiated by NASDA in 1996, as a follow-on to the tropical-focused Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) project [A. Rosenqvist et al., (2000)]. Utilising the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1). one of the main objectives of the GBFM project is the generation of extensive, pan-boreaL SAR image mosaics, to provide snap-shots of the forest wetland and open water status in the mid-1990's. Mosaics over Canada, Alaska. Siberia and Europe have been generated, available on the Internet and on DVD free of charge for research and educational purposes. The GBFM project also entails research activities in North America, Siberia and northern Europe, aimed at advancing scientific applications of L-band SAR data in the boreal zone."
1066512,21349,11104,Quality of orthorectified TerraSAR-X products,2007,"Summary form only given. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed the TerraSAR-X Ground Segment. One part is the geocoding system that provides orthorectification capability for multi- resolution, multi-polarisation and multi-frequency data. Besides an ellipsoid corrected product a new product called Enhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC) will be offered that considers digital elevation models (DEM) of a moderately coarser resolution then the 1 up to 3 m resolution of the TerraSAR-X modes. SRTM/X-band DEMs with approximately 25 m spacing will be the backbone for this operational and fully automated service. As optional product an geocoded incidence angle mask (GIM) is available providing information about the incidence angle of the radar beam, as well as about layover and shadow areas. High precision terrain correction using high resolution DEMs, tie-pointing and image adjustment will be implemented in an experimental processor. This paper gives detailed information on the image quality, which is examined in detail based on the first available geocoded TerraSAR-X products. Therefore radiometric and geometric aspects will be investigated. It is to be shown that the orthorectification step does not tamper the original radiometric properties. The geometric accuracy of the orthorectification mainly depends on the quality of the used DEM. Besides the SRTM/X-band DEM additional elevation data like SRTM/C-band, ERS-derived and GLOBE data are used for EEC generation. The achieved pixel location accuracies will be presented. The quality characteristics of the Geocoded Incidence Angle Mask - depending also on the used DEM - are described. Moreover the high precision orthorectified image (called geocoded terrain corrected - GTC) will be examined with regard to pixel location accuracy. A high resolution laserscanning DEM, tie-points and image adjustment will be used for this analysis. Furthermore information regarding processing performance will be given."
1789668,21349,11104,Analysis of Urban Land Use Pattern Based on High Resolution Radar Imagery,2006,"The actual process of rapid urbanization is associated with various ecological, social and economic changes in both the urban area and the adjacent natural environment. To keep up with the effects and impacts of this development, effective urban and regional planning requires accurate and up-to-date information on the urban dynamics. Recent studies have proven the applicability of high resolution optical satellite data for the acquisition of some of the requisite spatial and socio-economic information. Although radar data is more reliably available than optical imagery, high resolution radar imagery has barely been employed for urban applications so far. This fact is mainly due to a lack of civil space borne radar systems featuring a ground resolution which is suitable for the analysis of urban structures. Additionally significant difficulties concerning the interpretation of according data over highly structured urban areas occur. The german TerraSAR-X system will provide radar imagery with a spatial resolution comparable to actual high resolution optical platforms. This study investigates the potential use of high resolution radar data in the context of urban applications. Thereby a concept - that was developed on the basis of SAR data recorded by DLR's airborne E-SAR system - will be adapted to an analysis of TerraSAR-X imagery. It introduces a temporally and spatially robust approach towards an automated analysis of the urban structure. For that purpose data sets of single-polarised X-band imagery are analysed by means of an object-oriented classification. This study includes the development of an improved image segmentation procedure in order to create meaningful spatial entities. Moreover, it contains the definition and application of a rule base for the detection of built-up areas, the derivation of the urban land cover and the generation of additional value-added information related to the urban structure."
2207717,21349,11104,Regional MODIS analysis of abandoned agricultural lands in the Kazakh steppes,2004,"The institutional consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 have been greatly underestimated as a significant forcing on the boundary layer through changes in land surface phenology. Upon independence, Kazakhstan lost the centralized agricultural planning, crop subsidy system, and access to international markets that the Soviet Union had been providing. These institutional changes led to substantial decreases in livestock populations, especially sheep, and in arable land area cultivated, especially rain-fed spring wheat in northern Kazakhstan. As a result the fallow fields reverted to weedy species and idle pastures produced denser grass cover. In this case study we used MODIS imagery from three consecutive growing seasons (2001-2003) to study the processes that occur after arable land has been abandoned, a process that is often underestimated in carbon cycle modeling, but which is especially important in central and northern Eurasia. We selected two study regions in northern Kazakhstan: one in the Kazakh forest steppe ecoregion and another in the Kazakh steppe ecoregion. Within each region we visually determined a spring wheat area, and an area with other land cover. We then constructed land surface phenology models based on MODIS imagery from March 2001 through October 2003 and accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) calculated from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data. Comparisons among these phenology models provide insight into the land cover change trajectories that have occurred since large areas of arable land have gone fallow. Furthermore, we determine the change in parameters based on different land cover percentages. We have shown that abandoned arable lands green up before croplands that are plowed for planting in the last week of May. This may explain, in part, the greening trend that has been observed over northern Eurasia by other investigations"
2346879,21349,11104,Complex vegetation cover classification study of the Yellow River Basin based on NDVI data,2004,"In order to better reflect the response of natural geographical environment factors, such as hydrology, climate and soil, to the changes of land use/land cover, land cover classification using multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing observation data has been an effective technique. This paper adopts a multi-dimension classification method to classify the vegetation cover of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China by using NOAA/AVHRR remote sensing image as data source. Better classification resolution, which Mill provide scientific basis to study on increasingly prominent ecological-environmental problems, hydrology and water resources of the YRB, is acquired by this complex classification method. With the support of geography information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this paper makes use of principal component transformation (KL transformation) to classify the vegetation cover using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of NOAA/AVHRR remote sensing image as data source with spatial and temporal resolution at 1 km times 1 km and a vegetation growth cycle. Principal component transformation is first carried out on 3 normalized images of bio-temperature (BT), potential evapotranspiration rate (PER) and annual precipitation (P) which are the controlling factors on vegetation distribution pattern and the first principal component is chosen as the first classification vector of the digital image of the vegetation cover classification of the YRB. Because the basin topography is complex and underlaying surface condition has great impact on vegetation growth, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) image of the YRB became the second classification vector. Then, the first 3 principal components from the time series of the 12 monthly NDVI images are combined with the first and the second classification vectors to consist of the integrated image with 5 bands. After integrating the multidimension information, the vegetation cover of the YRB is finally classified into two grads with iterative self-organizing data analysis technique A (ISODATA) and unsupervised classification method, including 8 vegetation types and 25 vegetation subtypes"

These regions are praised as the resources bank of biological species and China's water tower. But now, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is suffering from ongoing land desertification and Qinghai Lake area is the most severely place among these regions. Based on field investigation and land desertification classification, applied remote sensing image processing software system ARC/INFOR and ARCVIEW, and utilized a 1: 50,000 land-use map of this area, two phases Landsat TM/ETM remote sensing data obtained in 1986 and 2005 were compared in this paper. Studies show that ecological environment in Qinghai Lake area is in continued deterioration. Land desertification is developing rapidly and desertified land is expanding at an annual rate of 2.72%. Land desertification in this area have been caused by warming and drying climate, rat-caused damages and the damages from pest, unreasonable human activity such as irrational constructing of infrastructure, improper grassland management, etc. The eco-environmental deterioration has resulted in negative influence to local society and economy, such as sharply decreased livestock carrying capacity, lowered living standard, more and more ecological refugee, serious social problems, etc. Such critical problems urge the authors to search for approaches of ecological alleviation in the Qinghai Lake area. So the following countermeasures are put forward: to implement ecology emigrating project and set up ecological compensative mechanism; to carry out restoration of grassland eco-system by eliminating rat and pest-caused damages; to establish scientific research bases for developing and spreading new-high applicable technologies; to establish the management system so as to make reasonable use of the grassland."

The Kendrapara district of Orissa state hit by a tropical cyclone on 30th October 1999 is considered as study area and for this area, pre event (October 11, 1999) visible- near IR image and pre (October 11, 1999) and post event (November 2, 1999 and November 4, 1999) Radarsat images were procured. The pre event IRS ID LISS III (resolution = 22 m) image of Kendrapara district was geometrically corrected and classified into several landuse and landcover classes. Supervised classification technique was used for landuse/landcover classification. This landuse/landcover map is assumed to be accurate and is used as a base map in the present study. Pre and post event Radarsat-SAR images were also geometrically corrected. Further preprocessing included speckle noise removal, data calibration and incidence angle adjustment. Based on literature, a threshold of -16.5 db (DN value =100) was chosen to classify each pixel in pre Radarsat-1 SAR image as water or non-water. The landuse/landcover map was used to identify the rice regions in the pre and post-event Radarsat images. Application of the threshold allows for the determination of the submerged rice areas. To determine the validity of a single threshold, water pixels in pre event Radarsat-1 SAR images were extracted corresponding to the base map. A histogram of these values suggests that a single value threshold approach may not be fully accurate. To overcome these limitations, two alternative approaches, namely image histogram and change in db were formulated. For both approaches, the rice pixels in pre and post event Radarsat- SAR images were extracted corresponding to base map rice pixels. In case of image approach, a histogram was plotted for the DN values of the pre and post Radarsat-1 SAR rice pixels. This allows the qualitative identification of the submerged rice areas. Using change in db approach, pixel-to-pixel change in db in pre and post event Radarsat-1 SAR images in rice pixels was calculated. Analysis of these values allows for the identification of different effects of submergence on the rice area. This type of analysis will help policy makers in determining the extent of submergence and could serve as a tool for rapid assessment of damage and help expedite release of relief funds and aid proper allocation of funds to the affected areas/people."
1940339,21349,11104,"Potential retrieval of biophysical parameters from FLORIS, S3-OLCI and its synergy",2012,"The main objective of FLEX is the measurement of vegetation chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) from space and the exploitation of this signal to better understand the carbon cycle. FLuORescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) is the main instrument of the FLEX mission concept. ESA's Earth Science Advisory Committee recommended the investigation of the FLEX concept as an in-orbit demonstrator to be flown as a tandem mission with Sentinel-3 (S-3). S-3 is amongst others equipped with the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). When flown in tandem these instruments are expected to provide an accurate characterization of key atmospheric and surface parameters to facilitate Fs retrieval for FLORIS. In this work the performance of FLORIS and S3-OLCI sensors and their synergy was evaluated on their capability of retrieving relevant biophysical parameters using simulated top-of-atmosphere radiance data (L TOA ). For both sensors, L TOA  data were simulated across a wide range of vegetation, atmospheric and geometry parameters by coupling leaf, canopy and atmospheric radiative transfer models. The pursued analysis was to train for each retrievable parameter (here: Chl, LAI, soil type and F total ) a regression model using the simulated datasets and then evaluate its performance. Two regression types were chosen, a conventional linear regressor and a more advanced nonlinear regressor, and two types of training/validation strategies were followed: a local strategy (at least 2 parameters fixed) and a generic strategy (uniform random subset of the complete dataset). The simulation study led to the following conclusions: 1) FLORIS is well equipped for accurate retrieval of biophysical parameters; 2) however, advanced nonlinear regressors may be needed to achieve robust results, and 3) the large number of bands can lead to redundancy in the nonlinear regressors which can be overcomed by band optimization strategies. Finally, 4) it was demonstrated that a synergy of both FLORIS and S3-OLCI datasets leads to improved biophysical parameter retrieval."
1962563,21349,11104,The TerraSAR-L basic product tree,2004,"The TerraSAR-L system, currently being designed in a Phase B definition study, provides ESA with its most powerful radar-imaging programme to date. The platform is optimized for and built around the 11 mtimes2.9 m active phased array antenna of the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (L-SAR). The L-SAR features, on top of standard Stripmap and ScanSAR operations, full polarimetric capabilities, repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry and a Wave Mode. Specification of the L-SAR has been guided by a careful analysis of the product requirements resulting in a robust baseline design with considerable margins. Besides, a major contribution to applications in areas of climate change and oceanography, the TerraSAR-L design responds specifically to requirements from interferometric applications. One key element of the TerraSAR-L operations strategy is a long-term systematic and repetitive acquisition scenario to ensure consistent data archives and to maximize the scientific and commercial exploitation of this SAR system. The other important factor is a systematic processing of all acquired data to Single-look Slant-range Complex (SSC) products to facilitate higher level product generation and services based on these products. This paper describes the TerraSAR-L basic product tree and explains the rationale behind. The nominal TerraSAR-L imaging modes are introduced and their performance characteristics are described. The generation concept of multi-look detected products based consistently on complex products - generated either at an intermediate stage during ground segment processing or serving as input product into a stand-alone tool - is introduced. A modular SAR processor design using the same complex product generation algorithms as far as possible independent of the underlying imaging mode is addressed"
594219,21349,11104,Inventory survey of conversion farmlands to forest by Landsat TM and field survey in upstream of Yangtze rivers in China,2005,"In 1998, the Chinese government established the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP). The NFCP was applied to 18 provinces and autonomous regions, which emphasize the upstream regions of major rivers' drainage area, specifically the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers where had have suffered massive ecological degradation and deforestation in the past 50 years. One of the most important tasks of NFCP was to mandatory conversion of marginal farmlands to forest where topographical slope gradient was more than 25 degree. It has been four to five years since mandatory conversion of farmlands to forest was implemented. But how about the effect of the implementation? Aiming at Jiulong county, Sichuan province, a portion of Yangtze Rivers upstream, we surveyed the effect of farmlands reforestation in support of RS (remote sensing) ,GIS (geographical information system) and GPS (Global Positional System) technology, and attempted to apply RS technology to the special ravine terrain region where the proportion of farmland is extraordinarily small (0.6%). According to the survey results from different periods of remote sensing datum (1999 and 2003) and field research, it could be concluded as follows: (1) In order to get more public subsidy of reforestation or regrassation, the local government registrated farmland area was much more than actual reforested area in practice. In our research region, only average 20.1% (the bias of estimation is -15.4%o) farmlands area had been reforested actually, however, the local government registrated that was 84.6%o. (2) and the most serious problems in the reforestation are: selection of canopy forest species only (most of them are climax species) in reforesting, planting of few pure tree species in the whole region and neglect of the adaptation of variation ecotype to local environmental conditions. The paper also analyzed that how to make use of some theories of ecology and theirs applications to reforestation supported by the GIS technology in local region."
2213138,21349,11104,Improved beat frequency estimation in the MLBF Doppler ambiguity resolver,2005,"Among the current Doppler ambiguity resolvers, the Multi-Look Beat frequency (MLBF) algorithm proves to be the most reliable one, especially in high contrast areas. The existing MLBF algorithm uses FFTs to measure the central frequency of the beat signal but the estimation accuracy is limited by quantization errors. This paper proposes an improved method of estimating the beat frequency in the MLBF algorithm that is based on phase increments. In our work, we examined five established frequency estimators and found that the Iterative Linear Prediction (ILP) method has the best performance. The experimental results on RADARSAT-1 data show that the new MLBF algorithm using ILP can obtain the correct ambiguity number in a higher percentage of blocks and that the RMS error of the results is less than half that of the existing method. I. INTRODUCTION In high quality SAR data processing, the estimation of the Doppler centroid frequency is an essential procedure for good image focus. Due to the fact that the azimuth data are sampled by the PRF, the Doppler centroid estimate is observed in two parts: the baseband Doppler centroid and the Doppler ambiguity. In the estimation of the baseband part, algorithms such as the Spectral fit and Average Cross Correlation methods can give reliable estimates in most cases (1). A number of algorithms have been developed to find the Doppler ambiguity number, such as Look Misregistration (2), Multiple PRF (3), Wavelength Diversity (WDA) (4), Multi-look Cross Correlation (MLCC) and Multi-look Beat frequency (MLBF) (5) algorithms. However, the accuracy and robustness of the Doppler ambiguity estimate still needs to be improved to satisfy the current high quality SAR processing requirements. The Multi-look Beat frequency (MLBF) algorithm proposed in 1996 (6) takes advantage of the differences between the azimuth frequency of two range looks to estimate the Doppler centroid. It has good performance in medium and high contrast areas. It also avoids estimating the offset frequency due to the antenna characteristics, as required in the WDA and MLCC algorithms. However, because the existing MLBF algorithm uses FFTs to estimate the central frequency of the beat signal, the estimate accuracy is affected by quantization errors, which are related to the FFT length. In addition, the algorithm using FFTs cannot be applied directly to burst mode data, such as ScanSAR data (6). In this paper, an improved beat frequency estimation method is presented that uses frequency estimators based on phase increments of the beat signal. Experimental results with RADARSAT-1 data show that it has a significantly better performance than the existing method of estimating the beat frequency. II. THE EXISTING MLBF ALGORITHM A. The principle of the beat frequency The MLBF algorithm is based on the fact that the Doppler centroid frequency can be derived from the azimuth frequency difference of radars operating at two different center frequencies. In this algorithm, the range compressed signal, s(η), is divided into two range looks, s1(η) and s2(η). Then, by multiplying (beating) the signal of one look with the conjugate of the other look, a beat signal results for a point target:"
2340824,21349,11104,Altimetric calibration experiences in the Western Mediterranean,2007,"Since many years, space borne radar altimeters have brought a powerful contribution in monitoring the dynamic sea surface topography, and in understanding better the ocean circulation and its impact on the earth system. Today, altimetric satellites are observing the whole oceans, measuring the sea surface height with a rms precision of 3-4 cm at 1 Hz sampling, as demonstrated by TOPEX/POSEIDON, launched in 1992, by Jason-1, launched in 2001 and by ENVISAT, launched in 2002. Such a high level error budget was achieved thanks to the tremendous improvements which have been obtained in radar performances as well as in precise orbit determination. Indeed, applications of altimetry in oceanography and geodesy requires very precise measurements of the satellite-sea level range, along with appropriate environmental corrections, but also an accurate knowledge of the satellite position with respect to the Earth reference. One campaign has also been made in June 2003 at the Ibiza island area (Martinez-Benjamin et al., 2003). The marine geoid has been used to relate the coastal tide gauge data from Ibiza and San Antonio harbours to off-shore altimetric data. A technical Spanish contribution to the calibration experience has been the design of GPS buoys and GPS catamaran taking in account the University of Colorado at Boulder and Senetosa/Capraia designs. We present a synthesis of the sea level results results obtained from the altimeter calibration campaign at Ibiza island on June 2003 using the direct measurements from GPS buoys and the derived marine geoid. The main objective of the marine campaign was to check the value of Ibiza Island as a permanent calibration site in the western Mediterranean Sea, to complement the Corsica site in the network of altimeter calibration sites."
1784880,21349,11104,Study on village pattern evolution in the middle region of Huang-Huai-Hai plain,2007,"Based on the data obtained from face-to-face interview and the measurements using global positioning system (GPS) and geographical information system (GIS) technology, the village pattern evolution of the WL village in the middle of the Huang-Huai-Hai plain was studied. The main results are shown as follows. Firstly, the WL village goes through a series of evolution pattern including the absolute tardiness development before the establishment of People's Republic of China in 1949, the relative tardiness development before the implementation of the economic reform in 1978, the rapid expansion in the 1980s, the steady scale in the 1990s and the recessionary development in the early 21st century. In the meantime, the roads and ponds in the village have also been changed correspondingly. The village scale changed little before the implementation of reform and opening- up in 1978, the dilation of it was prominent from 1978 to the 1990s, and the empty and abandoned houses have increased largely since about 2000. Secondly, main factors influencing the village pattern evolution include the economic improvement, the change of society structure, urbanization and the effect of national policy, while population variation is still the decisive factor. Thirdly, the previous village expansion attributed to four aspects as follows: No family planning after the national liberation in 1949 resulted in population increasing enormously; the economic development enabled people to improve their habitations; the status of nuclear families (namely a family consisting of few people which only include husband, wife and their children in general.) was enhanced step by step; farmers were not conscious of the importance of protecting plantations. Finally, the urbanization and market economy develop further, the profit of planting grains is too small and the fast increase of population has been successfully controlled by the policy of family planning since the 1980s. All these drive the abandoned houses increasing and the village hollowing at present."
1994785,21349,11104,Flood Simulation with Distributed Hydrological Approach Using DEMs and Remotely Sensed Data,2006,"The spatial variability of both meteorological and geographic features has a great influence on rainfall runoff process. When making flood forecasting, the influence of this variability on runoff should be considered. In this paper, the distributed hydrological modeling technique was adopted to simulate flood discharge with consideration of spatial variability using DEMs and remotely sensed data. In our approach, the grid based digital elevation data was used for the presentation of watershed discretization and deriving flow path system and parameters. The infiltration and rainfall excess on each hillslope grid cell were calculated using the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. Soil lateral flow was estimated based on Darcy's law and continuity equation, overland and channel flows were calculated by using one-dimensional kinematic wave equations on hillslope and channel grid cells respectively. The land use and land cover data derived from remotely sensed images was used for the determination of Manning's roughness coefficients. The soil type data was used for deriving soil hydraulic parameters needed for calculation. The approach was applied in Jiaokou Watershed with area of 259 km 2 , a sub-basin of Yongjiang River in Zhejiang Province, China. The data collected for this study included land cover processed from Landsat TM images, soil type distribution from the soil maps, and 100-m spatial resolution DEMs produced from digital topographic maps. Spatial distribution of rainfall for each flood event was calculated by using distance inverse interpolation methods. Nine flood events were simulated, two of which were used for calibration, and the others for validation. The simulated hydrographs at basin outlet showed good agreement with observed ones for both calibrated and validated flood events, and average coefficients of efficiency were 94% for calibrated flood events and 92% for validated flood events."

1208342,21349,11104,Spectral Behavior of the Ocean Surface Backscatter and the Atmospheric Boundary Layer at C- and Ku-band under High wind and Rain Conditions,2006,"During the NOAA/NESDIS 2005 Hurricane Season (HS2005) and the 2006 Winter Experiment, the University of Massachusetts (UMass) installed two instruments on the NOAA N42RF WP-3D research aircraft: the Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (IWRAP) and the Simultaneous Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR). IWRAP is a dual-band (C- and Ku), dual-polarized pencil- beam airborne radar that profiles the volume backscatter and Doppler velocity from rain and that also measures the ocean backscatter response. It simultaneously profiles along four separate incidence angles while conically scanning at 60 RPM. SFMR is a C-band nadir viewing radiometer that measures the emission from the ocean surface and intervening atmosphere simultaneously at six frequencies. It is designed to obtain the surface wind speed and the column average rain rate. Both instruments have previously been flown during the 2002, 2003 and 2004 hurricane seasons. For the HS2005, the IWRAP system was modified to implement a raw data acquisition system. The importance of the raw data system arises when trying to profile the atmosphere all the way down to the surface with a non- nadir looking radar system. With this particular geometry, problems arise mainly from the fact that both rain and ocean provide a return echo coincident in time through the antenna's main lobe. This paper shows how this limitation has been removed and presents initial results demonstrating its new capabilities to derive the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind field within the inner core of hurricanes to much lower altitudes than the ones the original system was capable of, and to analyze the spectral response of the ocean backscatter and the rain under different wind and rain conditions."
919044,21349,11104,ADM-Aeolus: The first space-based high spectral resolution Doppler Wind Lidar,2007,"The 'Living Planet Programme' of the European Space Agency (ESA) is gaining momentum. Six Earth Explorer missions are currently being implemented including ADM- Aeolus, ESA's Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) mission. The Aeolus mission will demonstrate the capability of a space- borne high spectral resolution DWL to accurately measure wind profiles in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere (0- 30 km). The Mission thus addresses one of the main identified deficiencies of the current Global Observing System (GOS). From the backscattered frequency-shifted laser light it will be possible to obtain about 3,000 globally distributed horizontal line-of-sight (HLOS) wind profiles daily. The accuracy of the Aeolus winds, in cloud-free regions and above thick clouds, is expected to be comparable to that of radiosonde wind measurements. Additional geophysical products that will be retrieved from the Aeolus measurements are cloud and aerosol optical properties. Aeolus HLOS wind profiles will find wide application in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate studies, improving the accuracy of numerical weather forecasting, advancing our understanding of tropical dynamics and processes relevant to climate variability and climate modelling. Impact experiments, assimilating synthetic Aeolus wind data into operational NWP models, have already been performed. One focus has been the forecast performance in regions known to be particularly sensitive to the accuracy of the initial conditions. The tentative results show that the largest benefits from Aeolus HLOS winds can be expected over the oceans and in the Tropics. In view of other lidar missions in space, the potential of a long-term database of cloud and aerosol optical properties is being studied. An additional topic is the potential benefit of wind profile observations in the lower stratosphere. Ground-based and airborne campaigns are being prepared for the validation of the Aeolus Airborne Demonstrator (A2D) - a high spectral resolution DWL instrument with technology very similar to Aeolus. This paper provides an overview of the Aeolus mission, the science and application activities being performed in support of the mission and the potential benefit of such observations in a wider context."
2904422,21349,11104,Impacts of aerosol scattering on the short-wave infrared satellite observations of CO 2,2016,"Global climate change is one of the most challenging issues facing the world today. Atmospheric aerosols and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), as two key factors driving the global climate change, have earned enormous attention from scientist around the world [1]. One challenge for the satellite measurements of CO 2  using this SWIR wavelength range (∼1.6µm) is the impact of multiple scattering by aerosols and cirrus [2]. Since the rapid economic growth and associated increase in fossil fuel consumption have caused serious particulate pollution in many regions of China [3], remote sensing of CO 2  using SWIR band in China needs to pay more attention to the scattering properties of aerosol particles and the multiple scattering. Considering the complexity of morphological and chemical properties, aerosol particles are grouped based on a large number of TEM/SEM images, and then their scattering properties at 1.6µm band are calculated by the T-matrix method [4] and GMM method [5]. In this study, the Monte Carlo method is used to solve the multiple scattering problem by simulating photons transport in the scattering media. We combined this multiple scattering model with the LBLRTM [6] as a forward radiative transfer model for studying the impact of aerosol scattering on the satellite observations of CO 2  using SWIR band. Finally, based on the GOCART aerosol component products, AERONET aerosol size distribution products, CALIPSO aerosol profile products, and MODIS aerosol optical depth and surface albedo products, the monthly variability of errors in CO 2  concentrations over China were calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that AOD and surface albedo are two of most important factors for the satellite observations of CO 2 . For low surface albedo, the retrieved CO 2  columns are undervalued when aerosol scattering is neglected. While for moderate and high surface albedos, the retrieved CO 2  columns are overvalued. As shown in Fighre 1, CO 2  concentrations are overestimated in western regions of China, especially in desert areas (a maximum of ∼7.08% in September), and those are underestimated in eastern regions (a minimum of ∼−6.9% in June)."

The mission is expected to extend through 2007, when the NASA/NOAA/CNES follow-on mission, OSTM, will be launched with the wide-swath ocean altimeter on board. This unprecedented resource of valuable ocean data is being used to map sea surface height, geostrophic velocity, significant wave height, and wind speed over the global oceans. Altimeter data products are currently used by hundreds of researchers and operational users to monitor ocean circulation and improve our understanding of the role of the oceans in climate and weather. Ocean altimeter data has many societal benefits and has proven invaluable in many practical applications including: (1) Ocean forecasting systems, (2) Climate research and forecasting, (3) Ship routing, (4) Precision marine operations such as cable-laying and oil production, (5) Fisheries management, (6) Marine mammal habitat monitoring, (7) Hurricane forecasting and tracking, (8) Debris tracking. The data has been cited in nearly 2,000 research and popular articles since the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, and almost 200 scientific users receive the global coverage altimeter data on a monthly basis. In addition to the scientific and operational uses of the data, the educational community has seized the unique concepts highlighted by these altimeter missions as a resource for teaching ocean science to students from grade school through college. This presentation will highlight societal benefits of ocean altimetry data in the areas of climate studies, marine operations, marine research, and nonocean investigations."
2079528,21349,11104,Impact of spectrally dependent gain errors in hyperspectral data on the determination of chlorophyll concentrations in vegetation,2007,"In support of Phase A work on the proposed Hyperspectral Environment and Resource Observer (HERO) mission, the sensitivity of chlorophyll concentrations derived from vegetation red-edge analysis to a spectrally dependent error in the radiometric calibration of the hyperspectral data is investigated. A typical ground-based reflectance spectrum taken from a boreal forest Aspen leaf is converted to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance using the MODTRAN atmospheric correction model as implemented in the Imaging Spectrometer Data Analysis System (ISDAS). The resulting spectrum is then subjected to a randomly generated Spectral Gain Error (SGE). This process is repeated a statistically significant number of times to produce a simulated data set. By varying the magnitude of the SGE, several simulated data sets are produced representing different levels of relative calibration accuracies in the spectral domain. The simulated TOA data sets are then converted back to ground-based reflectance, once again using MODTRAN. For each pixel in the resulting data sets, red-edge parameters are determine using an Inverted Gaussian (IG) technique (red-edge inflection point - lambda p , reflectance minimum - lambda o , and sigma = lambda p -lambda o ) as well as a couple of commonly applied Vegetation Indices (R 740 /R 720  and R 710 /R 760 )- Each of these parameters results in a distribution of results, the width of which is dependent on the magnitude of the SGE applied to the data set providing the relationship between the parameters and the SGE. In order to tie these results to chlorophyll concentration levels, the PROSPECT Vegetation Model is used to invert the original spectrum. The sensitivity of each of the indices to the chlorophyll concentration is determined by varying its value in the PROSPECT model while holding the other three model parameters constant. Using these relationships, the sensitivity of the chlorophyll concentrations to the SGE is determined. A specification of the acceptable error in the chlorophyll concentration levels would then dictate the required level of accuracy in the spectral gain calibration. The relationship between the SGE and the chlorophyll concentration retrieval based upon any of the five investigated red-edge parameters is shown to be directly proportional."
1856934,21349,11104,Intercomparison of inversion algorithms to retrieve rain rate from SSM/I by using an extended validation set over the Mediterranean area,2004,"The capability of some inversion algorithms to estimate surface rain rate at the midlatitude basin scale from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data is analyzed. For this purpose, an extended database has been derived from coincident SSM/I images and half-hourly rain rate data obtained from a rain gauge network, placed along the Tiber River basin in Central Italy, during nine years (from 1992 to 2000). The database has been divided in a training set, to calibrate the empirical algorithms, and in a validation one, to compare the results of the considered techniques. The proposed retrieval methods are based on both empirical and physical approaches. Among the empirical methods, a regression, an artificial feedforward neural network, and a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) inversion have been considered. Three algorithms available in the literature are also included as benchmarks. As physical algorithms, the MAP method and the minimum mean square estimator have been used. Moreover, in order to test the behavior of the algorithms with different kinds of precipitation, a classification of rainy events, based on some statistical parameters derived from rain gauge measurements, has been performed. From this classification, an attempt to identify the type of event from radiometric data has been carried out. The purposes of this paper are to determine whether the use of an extended training set, referred to a limited geographical area, can improve the SSM/I skill in rain detection and estimation and, mainly, to confirm the validity of the physical approach adopted in previous works. It will be shown that, among all the estimators, the neural network presents the best performances and that the physical techniques provide results only slightly worse than those given by empirical methods, but with the well-known advantage of an easy application to different geographical zones and different sensors."
1546336,21349,11104,Improving national greenhouse gas inventories for forestry and land use change using open-source software,2015,"National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories are essential for public policy planning to mitigate GHG emissions. They provide critical information and enhance environmental integrity in planning and development of GHG mitigation policy. The characteristics of a high quality inventory are that it follows good practice according to the IPCC guidelines. The key components of good practice are that the inventory is transparent to others, has accurate and complete emissions estimates for all gases, sources and sinks; has consistent application of methods across time; and is comparable to inventories from other countries [1]. While developed countries struggle with implementation of good practice, most can produce reasonably high quality inventories [2]. However, the task is more challenging in low lying pacific island countries. Some of the specific challenges include: lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities of agencies in preparing inventories; small teams with limited resources; difficulty in retaining expertise; incomplete or non-existent activity data; inconsistent data between inventories; absence of an archiving system for previous inventories; no QA/QC plan [3]. As part of the UN-REDD Programme project on “Strengthening Regional Support to National Forest Monitoring Systems for REDD+ in the Pacific” a Regional Monitoring System has been developed to support low lying pacific island countries (Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, Tonga, Republic of Kiribati, and Federated States of Micronesia). Using the Republic of Palau as a case study, we present this system and focus on four main challenges; 1) improving activity data compilation through systematic land use assessment 2) application of simple land use mapping algorithms 3) application of a regional geo-spatial portal to support improved data management 4) application of open-source land use analysis systems to help manage and analyze inventory data."
2133642,21349,11104,Application of flood monitoring from satellite for insurances,2005,"Flood monitoring from satellite data provides the opportunity to quickly and precisely overview flooded areas. The extent of the flooding and affected areas can be delivered to water authorities, civil protection agencies or insurances. Evaluations include information to facilitate damage assessment, to better estimate risk in future, and to prepare protection measures. For demonstrating the potential of satellite based evaluations, results for the Elbe flood that occurred in central Europe in August 2002 are presented. This flood had a geographical and economic large impact. In order to identify the affected areas, a strip of 450 km along the river Elbe was investigated. Satellite data of different sensor systems (Landsat, SPOT, ERS) had to be analyzed to derive a complete flood extent data set. For different river sections satellite data of different dates were used to perform the best fit to the flood peak along the river. Damage assessment can be supported using the flood extent overlaid with a city map in high resolution. Maps of complete Dresden have been requested by a German insurance company to support their damage assessment. The evaluation of flooded areas further allows improvements for planning as e.g. the declaration of risk areas. Observed flood extents can serve as validation source for simulations of inundations using hydrodynamic models. The combination of additional information to the flood extent layer opens up various applications. Landuse classified in industrial areas, settlements, agriculture, and forest, which were derived from up-to-date satellite images, are intersected with the inundated areas. This intersection results into the detection of affected areas (and economic values), which have to be protected against flood events in future.

2455939,21349,11104,A Semi-Decadal Multi-Sensor Gridded Data Record of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from Aqua,2008,"Launched on May 4, 2002, Aqua carries two well calibrated independent infrared (IR) instruments, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro- radiometer (MODIS), which together could provide a precise decadal measurement across the IR electro- magnetic spectrum from 3.7 um to 15um to form a fundamental climate data record. According to the National Academy of Science - Nation Research Council report,the notion of a fundamental climate data record (FCDR) is defined as a time series of measurements of sufficient length and continuity to determine climate variability and change from sensor data (e.g., calibrated radiances, brightness temperatures (BT), radar backscatter) that have been improved and quality controlled over time. AIRS and MODIS have been continuously returning upwelling IR spectral radiance measurements while maintaining a nominal grid precision of ~0.2 - 0.4 K BT [2] with quality controlled calibration improvements for more than five years. Based on the Aqua senior Project Review of available flight fuel, power and orbital maneuvers, the assessed life span of the satellite Aqua is estimated to be 2013. AIRS and MODIS instrument teams also expect their passive radiometers to continue providing self-calibrating measurements with the same precision through the year 2013. With these assumptions, we show in this paper that with these two independent sensors on the same platform with on orbit relative validations, this data record would be of sufficient length and continuity to meet the FCDR definition to observe and determine the decadal variability of seasonal to interannual climate processes. In addition, NPOESS preparatory project will launch satellite systems carrying instruments similar to AIRS and MODIS which will enable production of an FCDR record for additional decades."
2562061,21349,11104,"The Tracking, Occultation and Ranging (TOR) instrument onboard TerraSAR-X and on TanDEM-X",2007,"TerraSAR-X, to be launched at the end of May, 2007, carries the tracking, occultation and ranging (TOR) Category A payload instrument package. The TOR consists of a high-precision dual-frequency GPS receiver, called integrated GPS occultation receiver (IGOR), for precise orbit determination and atmospheric sounding and a laser retro-reflector (LRR) serving as target for the global satellite laser ranging (SLR) ground station network. The TOR is supplied by the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) Germany, and the Center for Space Research (CSR), Austin, Texas. The objective of the German/US collaboration is twofold: provision of atmospheric profiles for use in numerical weather predictions and climate studies from the occultation data and precision SAR data processing based on precise orbits and atmospheric products. GFZ also supplies the TOR instrumentation for the follow-on mission TanDEM-X. For the scientific objectives of the TanDEM- X mission, i.e. bi-static SAR together with TerraSAR-X, the dual- frequency GPS receiver is of vital importance for the millimeter level determination of the baseline between the two spacecrafts. In the following, the TOR instrumentation is characterized by the features of and accuracies achievable with the GPS receiver and the LRR. The data flow is shown, as GFZ operates a high latitude data receiving station for fast data access, and runs a data system for preprocessing, archiving and retrieval. With this data system, higher level products are generated for TerraSAR- X, including near real-time orbits by GFZ and post-processed precise science orbits by GFZ and CSR. In the case of TanDEM- X, GFZ operationally determines the inter-satellite baseline on the millimeter level. CSR produces calibration orbits to support the GFZ operational activity. Orbit results in terms of latency and accuracy from current missions are given and achievable results for TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X are discussed."

CReSIS is the only NSF Science and Technology Center dedicated to developing techniques and technologies for determining the contribution of ice sheets to sea level rise. CReSIS is led by the University of Kansas with Elizabeth City State University,University of Pennsylvania,The Byrd Polar Center at Ohio State University,Haskell Indian Nation and The University of Maine as partners. In addition to its strong research and science mission,CReSIS education and outreach efforts are designed to impact the entire educational pipeline. The purpose of the CReSIS Education Program is to prepare future generations of scientists and engineers who are capable of assuming responsibility for our future work. These future leaders in polar science and engineering should more closely mirror the diversity in our world. Because our primary goal is to train our own replacements, our first priority is the graduate students who are most likely to begin supporting CReSIS' work in the nearterm. As a logical extension of that notion, our secondary focus is on generating a diverse pool of talented undergraduates to begin filling graduate student roles in Centeractivities. Thirdly, we must continue to provide opportunity, motivation, and focused supplemental content for K-12 students in order to create larger pools of STEM-capable and interested students at the college level. CReSIS engages directly with students in the classroom or through informal educational opportunities, letting them see firsthand what our researchers do and participate in project- based investigations and authentic research.

1974560,21349,11104,Study on hybrid inversion scheme under Bayesian network,2005,"A hybrid inversion scheme for estimating surface variables of vegetation is proposed under Bayesian Network(BNet) theory,and then is used to estimate chlorophyll content of winter wheat leaves(Cab) and Leaf Area Index(LAI) of canopy.A coupled physical model named PROSPECT+SAIL was chosen to generate simulation data set,which means that the SAIL model uses the leaf reflectance and transmittance derived from PROSPECT model to simulate canopy directional reflectance.Results derived from simulation data and SHUNYI Experiment in 2001 data show that both LAI and Cab can be estimated with an appreciated accuracy under the proposed scheme,except that there are about 10% of total points falling into failure inversion.Then an uncertain data handling method,which considers the measured data as the random variables obeying Gaussian distribution,is employed to solve the failure problem.As a result the failure points are removed successfully though the RMSE of estimated the two variables is larger slightly.The presented hybrid inversion scheme is a knowledge-based inferring mechanism in principle,so the updated information content in the inversion process is quantitatively calculated thanks to the concept of entropy introduced from thermodynamics.Contrasting to the conditional entropy,the posteriori entropy calculated according to our proposed probability revision algorithm is not a descending parameter.This property can give some indications in estimating the information content parameters and the currently used data,that is to say,if the data are consistent with the previously derived information of estimated parameters,then there is descending entropy,otherwise,it is ascending.In the last section of this paper,some discussions are presented about the problem on how to estimate and control the information stream,especially when the inversed physical model is nonlinear."

This project aims to develop a system, based on satellite data, able to support operationally the activities of users like Italian Civil Protection Agencies or Fire Dept. involved in fighting wild fires. In particular, the system should be able to support all the phases in which a fire fighting activity can be distinguished, namely: Territory management and resources dislocation (fire risk indices), fires detection and monitoring, damage assessment (burned areas and emissions in atmosphere). This paper presents the results obtained in the process of assessing the quality of a fire hazard forecast based on a fire potential index especially designed for the Mediterranean areas. This quality assessment is carried out comparing the daily computed indices with the fire distribution obtained by using a fire detection algorithm based on SEVIRI/MSG images.In fact, using a fire detection algorithm (SFIDE, System for Fires Detection), recently proposed by the authors, a despite of its low spatial resolution,the SEVIRI system is able to reveal, at latitudes corresponding to Italy,fires covering an area of the order of 0.1 ha. The fire potential index (FPI) is one of the most suitable to be computed by using satellite data even if ancillary information are still needed. The computation of this index requires the estimate of the relative greenness, the evaluation of the leaves humidity, the preparation of vegetation fuel maps. Among the parameters needed to compile this index the fuel type map is particularly crucial. In fact, accurate maps of this kind are not available for the Italian territory. Then, first of all, using Corine Land Cover and other available vegetation maps, medium resolution satellite images and in situ observations CRPSM carried out the development of these maps for a couple of Italian regions where the summer wild fires problem has higher incidence."
1942129,21349,11104,Study on land cover change detection method based on NDVI time series batasets: change detection indexes design,2005,"The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series database, derived from NOAA/AVHRR, SPOT/VEGETATION, TERRA or AQUA/MODIS, is increasingly being recognized as a valuable data source for extracting land cover and its change information at global, continental and large regional scale. However, existing approaches, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and change vector analysis (CVA) present considerable difficulties in taking full advantage the NDVI dataset for land cover change detection. Based on the assumptions that different land cover types have different NDVI temporal profiles and that the NDVI profile curve can be regarded as a spectrum in which an NDVI value for a certain date corresponds to on band value of this spectrum, we analyzed the existing change detection indexes and develop a new land cover change detection method based on Lance distance and a cross correlogram spectral matching (CCSM) technique. The new method was validated in the simulation experiments and a case study area of Beijing. From the results, we have demonstrated that the new method takes the shape and value features of NDVI profile curve into consideration. The relatively better performance of the new method can be attributed to two advantages: (1) the new method can discriminate long-term land cover changes form other changes by excluding false changes caused by vegetation phenology changes, climate events, atmospheric variability and sensor noise; (2) it is similarly sensitive to all kinds of land cover changes no matter where the changes have occurred. The better results compared with the CVA method suggest that the new method is effective and has potential for land cover change detection using an NDVI time-series dataset. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the method can not only be applied to NDVI datasets but also to other index datasets reflection surface conditions sampled at different time interval. It can also be applied to datasets for different satellites without the need to normalized sensor differences."
2017932,21349,11104,"Climate, vegetation phenology and forest fires in Siberia",2007,"A time series of 18 years of fAPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green parts of vegetation) data from the NOAA AVHRR instrument series was analyzed for interannual variations in the start, peak, end and length of the season of vegetation photosynthetic activity in Central and East Siberia. Variations in these indicators of seasonality can give important information on interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere. A second order local moving window regression model called the camel back method was developed to determine the dates of phenological events at subcontinental scale. The algorithm was validated by comparing the estimated dates to phenological field observations. Using spatial correlations with temperature and precipitation data and climatic oscillation indices, we postulate two geographically distinct mechanisms in the system of climatic controls of the biosphere in Siberia: Central Siberia is controlled by an Arctic oscillation/temperature mechanism while East Siberia is controlled by an El Nino/precipitation mechanism. While the analysis of data from 1982 to 1991 indicates a slight increase in the length of the growing season for some land cover types due to an earlier beginning of the growing season, the overall trend from 1982 to 1999 is towards a slightly shorter season for some land cover types caused by an earlier end of season. The Arctic Oscillation tended towards a more positive phase in the Eighties leading to enhanced high pressure system prevalence but towards a less positive phase in the Nineties. We suggest that the two mechanisms also control the fire regimes in Central and East Siberia. Several extreme fire years in Central Siberia were associated with a highly positive Arctic Oscillation phase, while several years with high fire damage in East Siberia occurred in El Nino years. An analysis of remote sensing data of forest fire partially supports this hypothesis."
1967247,21349,11104,Parametrization of integrated hydrological model of Nam Co lake catchment on Tibetan Plateau using synergy of SAR and optical data,2009,"Understanding of exchange processes over Tibetan Plateau including hydrological cycle is becoming increasingly important since their influence on the formation of the Asian monsoon system is known. Tibetan Plateau is source area for main Asian rivers that are of crucial importance for downstream communities of China, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and SE Asia. Accurate and up-to date information of the characteristics and the current trend of these changes, provided by modern satellite systems like TerraSAR-X, are thus needed. The study area is delimited by the watershed of Nam Co basin on Tibetan Plateau in Tibet Autonomous Region of China approximately 100 km NNW from Lhasa. The no-outlet basin of the lake offers an excellent example of landscape unit characteristic for Tibetan Plateau where all exchange processes between land and atmosphere can be studied. Hydrologic modeling of Nam Co basin will be supported by complex interpretation of TerraSAR-X data that will provide whole set of hydrologic parameters. The TerraSAR data will be processed in synergy with other available microwave and optical remote sensing data sets. Basic extracted variables will be thus transformed into meaningful hydrological parameters. Data evaluation will take into account various aspects of landscape qualities with respect to water cycle. Variability of lake level, seasonal changes of soil moisture, influence of wetlands, lake icing and snow melt will be estimated. The synergetic approach to interpretation of TerraSAR-X data will benefit from major advantages of the high spatial resolution, the fast repetition cycle and the full-polarimetric capabilities in combination with high resolution optical data (RapidEye, QuickBird, Kompsat-2, ASTER. Landsat etc.) and digital elevation models."

2426277,21349,11104,Mapping land surface fluxes using microwave and optical remote sensing data under high vegetation cover conditions during SMEX02/SMACEX,2004,"A two-source (soil + vegetation) energy balance model using microwave-derived near-surface soil moisture has been successfully applied in areas of relatively low vegetation cover. The utility of this approach in areas with high vegetation cover is explored and compared with a two-source scheme using thermal infrared data. The investigation used data collected over areas of high corn and soybean cover in central Iowa during the Soil Moisture Experiment in 2002 (SMEX02) and the Soil Moisture Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX). Maps of near-surface soil moisture data were obtained from the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR) observations, which provided 800 m resolution for the regional area. Fractional vegetation cover and leaf area index were estimated from the Landsat data, which also provided surface temperature. These data, along with local meteorological data, provided inputs for a two-source model. The model output using microwave data were compared with tower-based flux measurements in the watershed area. The model computed reliable estimates of net radiation and soil heat flux, yielding a root-mean-square-difference (RMSD) of around 20 Wm -2 . However, the model generally underestimated latent heat flux, LE, and overestimated sensible heat flux, H resulting in RMSD values of ~70 Wm -2  for LE and 45 Wm -2  for H respectively. The larger discrepancies in heat fluxes are due in part to the mismatch in model output resolution (800 m) versus source area contributing to the tower fluxes (~100m). The comparison between the model output of surface temperature and Landsat indicates that the temperature estimation is reasonable agreement with a RMSD 1.4degC. A comparison of fluxes mapped over the regional area using the microwave-based and thermal-infrared based model is made and factors contributing to the differences between model outputs are discussed"
1946867,21349,11104,Determine the location of a thermal front in the Iroise Sea by using HF radar data and tide model results,2007,"The Iroise Sea is a shallow sea, located on the North West European Shelf close to Western Brittany (France) and North of the Bay of Biscay. Due to strong gradients in the bathymetry close to the coast and strong local winds, tidal currents can reach up to 3.5 m/s during spring tide and induce a strong vertical mixing along the coast. During summer, solar radiation and thus warming of the sea surface, together with mixing along he coast, and thus colder temperatures in this area, leads to a formation of a thermal front, where the differences between the sea surface temperatures on both sides can reach up to 3degC. During the SURLITOP experiment, that took place from August to November 2005, two HF radar stations have been installed at the French coast. Both stations were working simultaneously at a working frequency of 12.4 MHz and a measurement cycle of 12 min. The surface current fields processed from the radar data have been interpolated to a regular 2times2 km grid. For the same period, tide model simulations (MARS 2D) have been processed with the same temporal and spatial resolutions. Because the model has been run under barotropic conditions, the location of the front, which is induced by density gradients, can not be reproduced. In contrast to the model, the radar measures the total circulation including the baroclinic signal, so that the difference between radar data and model results can be exploited to find the location of the thermal front. To validate this result, satellite remote sensed sea surface temperature data have been used. The result is very promising, as the region of highest differences between radar data and model results coincide with the location of the thermal front. The location of the front itself can be determined by the narrowness of the isotherms. Also the structures of the front isotherms and the strongest gradients of the currents are very similar. Thus it is possible, to determine the location and dynamics of a thermal front by using HF radar data in combination with model results, if the model is working under barotropic conditions."
2059993,21349,11104,Adjustment of cross-track dependence of TRMM Precipitation Radar observation,2007,"The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is NASA's first mission dedicated to observing and understanding tropical rainfall and its effects on global climate. The Precipitation Radar in TRMM is the first spaceborne instrument designed to obtain three-dimensional maps of precipitation reflectivity. Such measurements yield information on the intensity and distribution of rain, rain type and storm depth. An advantage of space radar is that the scattering volume has similar size at any location. However, it has been a challenge to compare data to the one that is collected from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) for varying scan angles. Intercomparisons between ground radar and spaceborne radar on a point-by-point basis can be a difficult task. Errors result from the mismatch between ground radar and spaceborne radar resolution volume, spatial alignment, and operating frequencies as well as the limited number of the data set collected instantaneously by both instruments. Differences in viewing aspects and resolution that result from the measurement of return signals from different volumes of the precipitation medium contribute to the intercomparison error. A study of the characteristics of the region of the bright band from TRMM-PR vertical profile measurements on a global scale indicates that while bright band height varies widely, the distribution of bright band structure does not vary around the globe. The results show that the average profile of the bright band vertical profile using bright band height as a reference point around the globe has unique profile and do not changes around the globe for large data set. This unique profile can be used to adjust the radar observation error due to different parameters. The TRMM-PR vertical resolution becomes poorer with increasing distance of the TRMM-PR samples from the nadir. Studying the model profile at the nadir profile and other profiles that are off-nadir ray can be used to build the statistical model that can be used to adjust the effect of the scanning cross-track at angle far from the nadir-ray, and the results are presented."
1892156,21349,11104,The GBFM radar mosaic of the Eurasian Taiga: selected topics on geo-location and preliminary thematic products,2004,"In the context of the Global Boreal Forest Mapping project (GBFM), an initiative of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), a continental scale radar mosaic of the Eurasian Taiga was compiled. The mosaic is composed of some 520 strip-images (typically covering 80 km by 2500 km each) acquired in 1997-98 by the L-band SAR aboard the JERS-1 spacecraft. The mosaic was assembled in two phases. Coverage in the first stage included the area between the Ural Mountains in the west, Bering Strait in the east, Arctic Ocean in the north and the Korean Peninsula in the south. In the second phase an extended version was produced that comprises the European part of the Boreal ecosystems west of the Ural Mountain and up to the European Union region. Pixel spacing of the high resolution final products is 100 m and map projection is Albers equal-area conical. In this paper selected topics are presented related to a revision of the mosaic geometry. This step was called for to improve the internal consistency and assure proper absolute geo-location of the mosaics with respect to reference data sets. It consists of: i) a data representation (virtual frames) for handling the strip-images in smaller units that are more effective for dealing with local distortions; and ii) inclusion of control points derived from the Landsat GeoCover data sets. Results characterizing the mosaic geometric accuracy in terms of root mean square residuals are reported. Finally, we present, as a first thematic result, a vegetation map at coarse resolution (900 m) derived by a combination of the Global Land Cover 2000 map and the GBFM radar mosaic"
1115855,21349,11104,Spatial and temporal varying thresholds for cloud detection in satellite imagery,2007,"A new cloud detection technique has been developed and applied to both geostationary and polar orbiting satellite imagery having channels in the thermal infrared and short wave infrared spectral regions. The bispectral composite threshold (BCT) technique uses only the 11 mum and 3.9 mum channels, and composite imagery generated from these channels, in a four-step cloud detection procedure to produce a binary cloud mask at single pixel resolution. A unique aspect of this algorithm is the use of 20-day composites of the 11 mum and the 11-3.9 mum channel difference imagery to represent spatially and temporally varying clear-sky thresholds for the bispectral cloud tests. The BCT cloud detection algorithm has been applied to GOES and MODIS data over the continental United States over the last three years with good success. The resulting products have been validated against truth datasets (generated by the manual determination of the sky conditions from available satellite imagery) for various seasons from the 2003-2005 periods. The day and night algorithm has been shown to determine the correct sky conditions 80-90% of the time (on average) over land and ocean areas. Only a small variation in algorithm performance occurs between day-night, land-ocean, and between seasons. The algorithm performs least well during the winter season with only 80% of the sky conditions determined correctly. The algorithm was found to under-determine clouds at night and during times of low sun angle (in geostationary satellite data) and tends to over-determine the presence of clouds during the day, particularly in the summertime. Since the spectral tests use only the short- and long-wave channels common to most multispectral scanners, the application of the BCT technique to a variety of satellite sensors including SEVERI should be straightforward and produce similar performance results."

1022284,21349,11104,The vegetation phenology detection in Amazon tropical evergreen forests using SPOT-VEGETATION 11-y time series,2012,"In tropical regions, the seasonal phenology and the interannual variability of carbon fluxes remain poorly understood, and its representation in global vegetation models highly simplified. However, previous field studies have explored the temporal dynamics of Amazonian vegetation and have shown unexpected and significant seasonal pattern in this ecosystem. Moreover, as a major component of the global terrestrial carbon cycle, the phenological behaviour of this tropical rainforest can significantly influence global dynamics of carbon fluxes and climate. In this context, it is crucial to detect the vegetation phenology in this region. However, field studies are rare and provide local information. By contrast, satellite data from medium resolution sensor offer the advantage of spatial and temporal resolution well adapted to phenological studies. Here, we explore the seasonal characterization of leaf phenology in the Amazon basin through vegetation indices, using a long time series of SPOT-VEGETATION data (2000–2010) at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The analysis is performed locally at a fluxtower site (Santarem) and at the basin scale. Temporal profiles are preliminary analyzed concerning potential artifacts on the cycle observed such as aerosols contamination or BRDF effects. The results indicate that the EVI is better suited than the NDVI to follow the vegetation dynamics in this region. An increase of this index is clearly observed during the dry season, suggesting a higher photosynthetic capacity as it matches higher gross primary production values measured from the fluxtower. Comparing with climate conditions, it is suggested that trees tend to produce new leaves in the dry season to optimize access to light and maximize the carbon uptake."
2220391,21349,11104,DOMEX 2004: an experimental campaign at dome-C Antarctica for the calibration of space-borne low-frequency microwave radiometers,2005,"Satellite data are the most suitable tools for monitoring time and spatial variations of snow covered areas and for studying snow characteristics on a global scale. Current knowledge of the microwave emission from the deep ice sheet in Antarctica is limited by the lack of low-frequency satellite sensors and by their inadequate knowledge of the physical effects governing microwave emission at wavelengths exceeding 5 cm. On the other hand, in addition to the interest related to climatic changes and to glaciological and hydrological applications, there is growing interest, on the part of the remote sensing community, in using the Antarctic and, in particular, the Dome-C plateau where the Concordia station is located, for calibrating and validating data of satellite-borne microwave and optical radiometers. This is because of the size, structure, spatial homogeneity, and thermal stability of this area. With a view to the future launches of two new low-frequency spaceborne sensors Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission and Aquarius, an experiment was carried out at Dome-C, thanks to financial support from European Space Agency, aimed at evaluating the stability and the absolute value of the L- and C-band brightness temperature Tb. This paper presents a report on the experimental campaign, the characteristics of the radiometric measurements, and on the main results. The C-band Tb data indicated a diurnal cycle amplitude of a few kelvin. It was confirmed that this takes place as a consequence of observed variability in the physical temperature of the top 4 m of the snowpack around the mean surface value of -24°C. In contrast, the L-band data indicated extremely stable Tb values of 192.32 K (1σ = 0.18 K) and 190.77 K (1σ = 0.57 K) at 0 = 45° and θ = 56°, respectively."
2394344,21349,11104,Calibration and performance validation of optical elements in a photoelastic modulator-based polarimetric camera,2008,"As part of NASA's Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), we have been developing enabling technologies for the Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI), a candidate instrument for the Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosytem (ACE) mission. ACE is one of several satellite concepts identified in the 2007 National Research Council Earth Sciences Decadal Survey. MSPI is a multiangle, multispectral, high-accuracy polarization imager, and is envisioned to contain multiple cameras pointed at different viewing angles, with intensity imaging in several spectral bands between the ultraviolet and shortwave infrared, and accurate polarimetric imaging in a subset of the bands. To achieve a degree of linear polarization (DOLP) uncertainty of 1%, we temporally modulate the linear-polarization component of the incoming light at a rapid rate, enabling each detector within a focal-plane array-combined with polarization analyzers-to measure the relative proportions of the linear Stokes components Q or U to the total intensity I. Our system uses tandem photoelastic modulators (PEMs) within a reflective camera design. We report on the status of our prototype camera development, with particular emphasis on theoretical and experimental work on the required and measured performance of optical elements within the system including: the spectropolarimetric filters, quarter wave plates, and tandem PEMs. We also report on the end-to-end measurement and calibration of camera polarization aberrations using a custom polarization state generator (PSG). Careful design and control of scattered light enables the PSG to generate polarization states between DOLP of 0.07% and 40% with an uncertainty of 0.05%, making it a precision tool for polarimetric calibration and validation of MSPI."
2105668,21349,11104,"Volcano-seismic signal detection and classification processing using hidden Markov models. Application to San Cristóbal volcano, Nicaragua",2009,"We present a method for automatic seismic event detection and classification, focusing on volcanic-seismic signals by means of the validity of the hidden Markov modeling (HMM) method in active volcanoes. Recordings of different seismic event types are studied at one active volcano; San Cristobal in Nicaragua. We use data from one field surveys carried out in February to March 2006. More than 600 hours of data in San Cristobal volcano were analyzed and 1098 seismic events were registered at short period stations. These events were manually labelled by a single expert technicians and identified three types classes of signals (S1, S2, S3) and tremor background seismic noise (NS). The method analyzes the seismograms comparing the characteristics of the data to a number of event classes defined beforehand. If a signal is present, the method detects its occurrence and produces a classification. From the application performed over our data set, we have demonstrated that in order to have a reliable result, a careful and adequate segmentation process is crucial. Also, each type of signals requires its own characterization. That is, each signal type must be represented by its own specific model, which would include the effects of source, path and sites. Once we have built this model, the success level of the system is high. Extensive performance evaluation is conducted to derive the optimal configuration of the different parameters Correct classification rates of up to 80% are achieved. The high success rates obtained imply that the method is fully able to detect, isolate, and identify seismic signals on raw seismic data. These results imply that, once an adequate training process has been used, the present method is particularly appropriate to work in real time, and in parallel to the data acquisition."
1967567,21349,11104,"UHF riversonde observations of cowlitz river flow velocity at Castle Rock, Washington",2004,"A UHF RiverSonde system, operating at a frequency of approximately 350 MHz, has been in operation on the Cowlitz River at Castle Rock, Washington since October 2003. The system uses SeaSonde electronics developed over many years for measuring ocean surface currents in salt water at HF. A three-Yagi antenna system designed using a genetic algorithm optimization procedure replaces the conventional crossed-loop HF array. The antennas, located on one bank of the river, are directed across the river at three different azimuths and are separated by approximately one-half wavelength, allowing both amplitude and phase differences to be used for MUSIC direction finding. Scattering from the fresh water surface is dominated by Bragg scattering as it is at HF, but the data processing algorithms are modified to accommodate flow velocities which can be several times the deep-water phase velocity of the Bragg waves. Data are processed in real time on a portable laptop computer and are available through a dial-up modem. The radar data provide hourly estimates of mean flow and cross-channel variations in the flow. Mean values of the radar flow profile track very closely continuous  in situ  stage height measurements. River flow velocities of 0.8-3.5 m s -1  were observed in the first five months of the experiment, with a nearly linear relationship between radar-inferred flow velocity and stage height of 9-14 m. The radar velocity also appears to have a weak correlation with the local wind and several tidal frequencies. The strong correlation between surface velocity and stage height suggests that - with refinement - surface velocity could replace stage height in river gaging, as well as offering additional flow information"
1520977,21349,11104,Validation of satellite precipitation product at an arid-semiarid basin with complex terrain properties,2013,"Satellite based High Resolution Precipitation Product (HRPP) (generally with a temporal resolution of 3h and spatial resolution of 0.25°×0.25°) is a valuable data source in global and regional hydroclimatologic applications. However uncertainty information for most of the satellite-based HRPPs is unavailable up to present. This paper presents a statistical evaluation study of daily TMPA research time precipitation products at an arid-semiarid basin with complex terrain properties in the northwest of China. Both local scale and regional scale evaluation studies are conducted utilizing gauge based datasets. Total 15 evaluation indices are selected for this study including 5 traditional quantitative statistical indices (CC, RMSE, ME, MAE and BIAS) and 5 categorical statistical indices (POD, FAR, PFB, CSI, and ETS) as well as 5 indices for bias/error decomposition evaluation(HB, MB, FB, RMSEs and RMSEr). New findings about the uncertainty characteristics of TMPA research time precipitation products can be concluded into the following three aspects: (1) both local and regional evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of daily TMPA products is climatology-dependent. For the middle-upper reaches of Heihe river basin, better performance is observed at the southern mountainous area where the climatology is wetter even with consideration of significant terrain effect which is caused by complex topographical variation there. Different bias/error characteristics would appear in different climatology. For the study basin, TMPA products overestimate precipitation in wetter region while make underestimation estimation in drier area. This implies nonuniform bias correction schemes for TMPA products may lead to accuracy improvement. (2) Performance of TMPA products is much worse in snowfall estimation than rainfall estimation and thus one should be cautious to use TMPA daily products in cold region or winter time. (3) little improvement in the performance of TMPA products on daily scale has been made by transition from version 6 to version 7. This study can serve as a reference of the uncertainty in TMPA research time precipitation products in hydrometeorogical applications on watershed scale."
2028972,21349,11104,Validation of an X-Band SAR Wind Algorithm by SIR-C/X SAR Data,2007,"Space borne radar systems are capable of providing wind field information over the ocean. Radar instruments are of high value for operational applications because of their all weather and daylight capabilities. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments as flown on the European satellites ERS-2, ENVISAT or the Canadian platform RADARSAT are of particular interest for applications where high resolution two- dimensional information on the near surface wind field is needed. All these operate in C-band. The respective wind field algorithm CMOD was tuned to this wavelength. New research focussed on high speed cases to be able to measure wind speeds above 20 m/sec and on the W to HH polarisation ratio. For future missions like TerraSAR-X, to be launched in May 2007 new wind field algorithms tuned to X-band are needed. The TerraSAR-X instrument has a spatial resolution of up to 1 m and additional features like multi polarisation which make it a very interesting tool for oceanographic applications. In this paper a new X band wind field algorithm, XMOD1.0 is introduced. The algorithm is based on the detection of wind streaks in the SAR images and scatterometer measurements of [1]. Data from the SRTM mission flown on the shuttle in February 2000 and SIR C/X SAR in 1994 are used to test the algorithm. Results are validated against in situ data and model data from ECMWF. The potential of SAR measurements to support the optimal siting, the design, as well as the operation of offshore wind parks is shown. Applications for offshore wind farming of the TerraSAR-X mission will be discussed. The platform FINO 1 was chosen as a primary test site to calibrate and validate wind fields for X band satellite images. For the development, optimisation and validation of the retrieval algorithms comparisons with in situ data, e.g., acquired at the FINO platform will be carried out. The respective calibration and validations strategies will be summarized."
1767473,21349,11104,Emissivities of rough surface over layered media in microwave remote sensing of snow,2007,"The rough surfaces in Greenland are exhibited as sastrugi. The roughness heights are less than 8 cm for much of the year except in late winter and spring, when they increase to 25 cm or less. Roughness profiles were also related to snow and firn ventilation. WindSat, launched in January 2003, was the first spaceborne polarimetric radiometer to measure all 4 elements of Stokes vector, viz., the vertical polarized brightness temperatures, the horizontal polarized brightness temperatures, and the real and imaginary part of the cross-correlations of the vertical and horizontal polarizations. It was shown by Tsang (1984, 1990) that azimuthal asymmetry will create nonzero third and fourth Stokes parameter in passive microwave remote sensing. Thus the third and fourth Stokes parameters contain information of the azimuthal structure. Usually the third and fourth Stokes parameters are quite small between 0.5 K to 1 K over land and less than plusmn2.5 K over ocean. However, measurements of third and Stokes parameters over Greenland show surprising values of 10 K for the third Stokes parameter and between -10 K and 20 K for the fourth Stokes parameter. In this paper, we use physically based electromagnetic model to study the passive polarimetric remote sensing of snow in Greenland by consider the scattering and emission from a random rough surface over multi-layered media. We consider the random rough surface varied in only one horizontal direction so that azimuthal asymmetry exists in the 3-D problem. Dyadic Green's functions of multilayered medium (Tsang et al., 2000) is used to formulate the surface integral equation so that the polarization dependence of emission and scattering is accounted for systematically. The surface integral equations are solved by using the method of moments in conjunction with fast numerical algorithms such as the multilevel UV method. Numerical results of brightness temperatures are illustrated for all four Stokes parameters to demonstrate the signatures of sastrugi in passive microwave remote sensing. To account for the large third and fourth Stokes parameters, we also consider the case of anisotropic scatterers in volume scattering. Full multiple volume scattering are studied with numerical solutions of the radiative transfer equations for non-spherical scatterers with preferred orientation."
1540942,21349,11104,Evolution of the Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS),2006,"The earth observing system (EOS) data and information system (EOSDIS) has been serving a broad user community since 1994. Most of NASA's Earth science data are currently being archived, managed and distributed by EOSDIS. Also, EOSDIS commands and controls EOS spacecraft and instruments, captures data from the instruments and processes them into a set of standard products. As of March 2006, the archives of EOSDIS held over 4.3 petabytes of data from over 90 instruments and over 2000 distinct science products. The distribution of data to end users amounts to approximately 2 TB a day. The community receiving data from EOSDIS is on the order of 200,000 distinct users from a diverse set of organizations and scientific disciplines. While EOSDIS is effectively managing a large amount of data and successfully serving a broad user community, it is a system whose design and development originated more than 10 years ago during which many advances have occurred in information technology. Although there has been an on-going process of technology infusion, incremental improvements in processing and performance, and new functionality added in areas of user access, distribution, and archive management over the years, the underlying design has remained essentially the same. During this time frame, data volumes have grown dramatically and the science community has gained considerable experience in processing and analyzing their data. More recently, through examination of current operations and a series of lessons learned, there has been a desire to re-examine current operations for significant improvements in a variety of areas. The overall objectives of the EOSDIS evolution are to: increase end-to-end data system efficiency and autonomy while decreasing operations costs, increase data interoperability and usability by the science research, application, and modeling communities, improve data access and processing, and ensure safe stewardship."
1935353,21349,11104,Automatic cloud detection on high resolution images,2005,"Remote sensing optical images are often cloudy and then partially unusable. Thus, cloud detection can optimize the image acquisition loop and the end-user image selection. The current pre-processing of SPOT images includes an automatic cloud and snow detection algorithm based on neural networks and fuzzy logic, which globally provides correct cloud masks but with a perfectible confidence. This process must be improved in order to avoid systematic manual re-notation. For Ple/spl acute/iades high resolution (HR) satellite, CNES experiments an innovative cloud detection method based on correlation and stereoscopic effect (B/H ratio) between images. Thanks to the quasi-simultaneous acquisition of the five spectral bands (panchromatic, red, blue, green and near infrared), this new method can be systematically applied, in addition to a radiometric one. This paper focuses on the new detection algorithm for high resolution images, which includes six main steps: (1) generation of 20 m resolution preview images in both multispectral and panchromatic bands, (2) estimation of the misregistration between panchromatic and multispectral previews using a geometric model, a global DTM and an image matching algorithm, (3) computation of the residual parallax consisting in the difference between prediction model and image matching, (4) cloud detection through high parallax value thresholding (5) radiometric analysis for snow and low altitude clouds detection, (6) masks fusion and confidence status computation. This method, still under assessment over various SPOT5 and Quickbird images, seems to be very promising. The results, presented in the paper, show that the method is efficient even for Quickbird images, in spite of the very low B/H ratio value (0.002) close to Ple/spl acute/iades one."
2230382,21349,11104,Emissivity Calculations for two-dimensional ocean Surfaces with the improved Integral Equation Model IEM2M,2006,"The Integral Equation Model (IEM) was developed originally by Fung and Pan (1986). The assumptions inherent to the model were amended in later publications but there were several important points that remained unclear and that propagated across all subsequent versions of the model. One of the authors of this paper proposed an improved IEM, called IEM2M (Alvarez-Perez, 2001), which removed these unnecessary assumptions and unified the small perturbation model (SPM) and the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) for bistatic scattering. This model was first criticized by Fung (2002) but later adopted by him and co-workers in 2003 and renamed as AIEM (advanced IEM). In contrast to other versions of IEM, IEM2M (integral equation model for second-order multiple scattering) is fully consistent with the SPM. This limit arises naturally from the second-order scattering terms when they produce an extra first-order contribution due to the local non-flatness, and therefore non-Kirchhoff character, of the surface. A central role in the IEM2M is played by a rigorous use of the Weyl representation of the retarded Green function through a homogeneous medium as well as a more physically based selection of the Fresnel coefficients. A further assessment of the model is its implementation for the problem of emissivity calculation. The difference between emissivity from a flat surface and a rough sea-like surface is very small and therefore demands an accurate description of the scattering coefficient, which must be integrated for all angles. Whereas an accuracy of 25% or 1 dB is sufficient for active remote sensing, passive remote sensing calculations require that energy conservation has to be typically within 0.3% error, which is the order of the aforementioned difference for flat and rough, sea-like surface emissivities."
1890285,21349,11104,Estimation of Surface Velocity from Infrared Image Using the Global Optimal Solution to an Inverse Model,2008,"We address the problem of obtaining ocean surface velocities from sequences of thermal (AVHRR) space-borne images by inverting the heat conservation equation (including sources of surface heat fluxes and vertical entrainment). We demonstrate the utility of the technique by deriving surface velocities from actual AVHRR images from one day. Typical formulations of this tracer inversion problem yield too few equations at each pixel, which is often remedied by imposing additional constraints (e.g., horizontal divergence, vorticity, and energy). In contrast, we propose an alternate strategy to convert the under-determined equation set to an over- determined one. We divide the image scene into many sub-arrays, and define velocities and sources within each sub-array using bilinear expressions in terms of the corner points (called knots). In turn, all velocities and sources on the knots can be determined by seeking an optimum solution to these linear equations over the large-scale, which we call the Global Optimal Solution (QOS). We test the accuracy of the GOS by contaminating the model output with up to 10% white noise, but find that filtering the data with a Gaussian convolution filter yields velocities nearly indistinguishable from those without the added noise. Application of the technique to a sequence of five NOAA AVHRR images yields a velocity field, which we compare with that from a Coastal Ocean Dynamics Radar (CODAR) array. We find that the GOS velocities generally agree more closely with those from the CODAR than they do with those from the MCC. Specifically, the root mean square error obtained by differencing GOS and CODAR velocities is smaller than that from the similar calculation with MCC velocities. The magnitude of the complex correlation between GOS and CODAR is larger than that between MCC and CODAR. The phase of the complex correlation indicates that both MCC and GOS on average yield velocity vectors biased in the clockwise direction relative to the CODAR vectors for the period examined."
1785762,21349,11104,Optimal siting of hydrological monitoring stations with respect to remote sensing-based geo-environmental patterns,2004,"The management of sustainable and dependable water resources in a semi-arid coastal watershed in South Texas, such as the Choke Canyon Reservoir Watershed (CCRW), is deemed critical because of complex relationships among ecosystems, social development, human health, and economic progress. To retrieve key hydrological information constrained by a limited budget, a set of hydrological monitoring stations in support of investigation of drought and flood impacts in the CCRW were identified by a grey integer programming (GIP) approach under uncertainty. The area of interest is divided into eight hundred cells in GIS for the 15,000-square-kilometer watershed area. Each cell size is 4-by-4 kilometer. The cells are assigned weights that could quantify monitoring values in terms of soil permeability, precipitation rate, evaporation rate, predicted soil moisture, evapotranspiration rate, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). RADARSAT and LANDSAT satellite images are acquired in support of determination for part of the weighted values, such as soil moisture and vegetation index, in the hydrological cycle. The weights are aggregated as coefficient matrices in a GIP model that help identify the most suitable locations. Fifteen cells are chosen out of eight hundred candidates and are ranked consecutively. Eventually, only five sites were selected after a site investigation based on site accessibility and practical uses of the selected sites. It may help collect a vital database at strategic locations, including wind speed, wind direction, soil moisture, ambient temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity periodically for drought and flood management in the future"
515588,21349,11104,A forward scattering model for foliage camouflaged complex targets,2004,"Detection and identification of hard targets inside vegetation canopies are among the challenging problems in remote sensing. The two challenging problems are (1) computation of the field propagation through and scattering from foliage; (2) characterization of the scattering from the target illuminated by the attenuated incident field and scattered field from foliage. An accurate hybrid method is proposed to characterize the effects of scatterings from forest components and their near field interactions with the hard target. Electromagnetic (EM) scattering from vegetation canopies can be simplified in terms of problems of scattering from individual dielectric cylinders and thin dielectric disks, modeling branches and leaves, arranged in a semi-deterministic fashion. The coherent summation of all the scattering contributions is considered in order to accurately compute the total field at a given point with in the forest canopy. The total field is composed of the mean field and scattered field and the mean field is derived, using Foldy's approximation. The total field is used as the excitation to illuminate the hard target which may have complex geometry and material properties. In order to have some level of accuracy and computational efficiency, physical optics (PO) approximation, is proposed as a solution for the problem of scattering from electrically large objects. It is shown that reciprocity theorem can be effectively applied to derive the back scattered field from the induced PO currents on the target. By this, the interactions of target and foliage on both illumination and scattering are taken in to account. The challenging step in this process is to determine lit and shadowed points on the target, considering the very complex geometry of the target and very large number of the scatterers around the target, which act as a source of illumination for the target. A powerful technique is proposed to accurately and effectively calculate the induced current on the target including the effects of shadowing. This model has been applied to a simple geometry' of PEC box and the reciprocity theorem is used to estimate the back scattered field from the object."
1986710,21349,11104,Performance of region-based matching techniques to compute the ocean surface motion,2007,"The study of the ocean circulation is the central core of all dynamical oceanography. The routine derivation of sea surface temperature or infrared brightness temperatures has been used to estimate the surface circulation by calculating the motion of the thermal features (coastal upwellings, filaments and eddies) in successive images. To that respect, a number of authors have developed different methodologies to recover the motion field, but the most straightforward methods match patterns (points, borders or regions) in all possible subwindows of one image with those in the next image. The maximization of the normalized cross- correlation coefficient, known as the Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) technique, is the most popular region-based matching metric applied to compute ocean circulation. In this paper a careful analysis of different region matching techniques has been conducted and the performance achieved for each approach is presented. The assessment methodology uses a database of synthetic sequences, real sequences and in-situ speed measurements. After the qualitative and quantitative analysis, we can conclude that the best performance is achieved by ZSAD, ZSSD, NZSSD and NCC metrics. These metrics achieve, when applied to synthetic sequences, mean angular errors around 30deg and magnitude errors around 30% for the worst case. In general the flow field recovered by the 4 previous metrics, perfectly models the motion of the structures in real sequences. Finally, results obtained with comparison with ground-truth data suggest an underestimation in the computed velocity between 35%-45% but with a higher angular accuracy, achieving global errors around 30deg-50deg. To conclude, it is important to emphasize that the prevalent MCC method provides acceptable results but with more errors when compared with the four previous metrics over the three databases."

The instrument is based on the exploitation of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and their augmentation systems (WAAS, EGNOS). The emitted signals provide an exceptional source of opportunity for passive remote sensing of the Earth. The use of GNSS reflections (GNSS-R) for sea-surface monitoring is a bistatic radar technique only requiring a receiving system. The concept has already been implemented for coastal platforms (few meters above the water), aircraft (1km to 10 km) and is being studied for space platforms (LEO, orbiting at 500-1000 km). The potential applications include sea-state, sea-surface altimetry and surface roughness, both for scientific and operational oceanography. We report on a recent long-term experimental and demonstration campaign, carried out at the Oceanpalreg Coeli station in the Barcelona Port during the period 2004-2007, with a real time web-based service. This campaign has been made possible through collaboration with the Barcelona Port Authority Environmental Monitoring Department (APB). The instrument was installed on a breakwater near the main entrance of the port, at 23 m over the sea-surface. We describe in this paper the successful long-term comparison between the data obtained by Oceanpal instrument and the observables recorded by two nearby buoys. Data used for this analysis cover a period of over one year, allowing a definitive evaluation of the performances of this GNSS-R based coastal instrument for SWH retrieval. We also review results from a weeklong phase altimetry campaign at the port of Vilagarcia."
2435814,21349,11104,Relating a Spectral Index from MODIS and Tower-Based Measurements to Ecosystem Light Use Efficiency for a Fluxnet-Canada Coniferous Forest,2008,"Hyperspectral reflectance data collected diurnally from an instrumented tower were examined in conjunction with the eddy correlation fluxes and meteorological measurements made throughout a growing season at a mature Douglas fir forest in British Columbia, Canada (DF49). Here we present 2006 in situ results relating the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI 551 ) to photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE). Canopy structure information was used to partition the forest canopy into sunlit and shaded fractions. At each observation period, the PRI 551  was examined for the sunlit, shaded, and mixed sunlit/shaded canopy segments as defined by their instantaneous position relative to the solar principal plane (SPP). We show that the PRI 551  clearly captures the differences in leaf groups on sunny days. We also examined PRI 551  from MODIS ocean band imagery acquired over DF49 during a five year period (2001-2006) from both Terra (late morning) and Aqua (early afternoon) platforms. The MODIS observations from Terra and Aqua were acquired in different viewing planes above the landscape over a range of view zenith angles, and sampled the backscatter (sunlit) and forward scatter (shaded) sectors of the forest's bidirectional reflectance distribution function. When tower-based bulk canopy LUE from 2006 was recalculated to estimate foliage-based values for the three foliage groups under their incident light environments, a strong linear relationship with PRI 551  was demonstrated (r 2 ~0.80). A similar relationship between the MODIS PRI 551  and tower-based bulk LUE was obtained from satellite observations (r 2 ~0.62), but only for the backscatter observations obtained at high light levels (APAR, >1500 mumol m -2  s -1 ). The MODIS observations, while not ideal in terms of spatial resolution (> 1 km 2 ) or optimal viewing configuration, nevertheless provided a means to monitor forest under stress using narrow spectral band indices and off-nadir observations."
2102192,21349,11104,Retrieval of vegetation understory information fusing Hyperion and panchromatic QuickBird data in the method of Neural Network,2007,"Vegetation cover is of great significance in understanding climate change process due to its vital role in controlling water and carbon cycles. The properties of vegetation's surfaces are usually estimated by remotely sensed data through regression models or physical-based models, which simulates the interactions of solar radiation with the vegetation medium. In real domain, the spectral responses measured by the sensor in forested area are strongly influenced by the different understory natural conditions that limit the possibility of applying both retrieval methods to predict overstory vegetation parameters. Understory information is therefore needed for estimating trees' parameters; moreover from a biodiversity point of view and perspective of forest management, understory represents a critical component of forest ecosystem that needs a better characterization. An experiment has been conducted using hyperion and panchromatic QuickBird data to explore the status of different vegetation's understory under a sparse forest in the Longmenhe Nature Reserve, China. Understory vegetation information of study area is classified into five classes. The novel aspect of the method is the integration of spectral (hyperspectral) domain fusion and spatial domain fusion techniques within a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network model. Real data from the experiment on a limited ground as well as hyperion and QuickBird data are used as input dataset. A nonlinear artificial neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 80% despite the presence of co-occurring mid-story and understory vegetation. The achieved results show that this method is able to identify the different vegetation information under the tree canopy. Our studies suggest that it is necessary to incorporate the geographic and vegetation community prior information to further improve the accuracy in order to monitor understory vegetation."
1916552,21349,11104,Effect of DEM Uncertainty on the Distributed Hydrological Model TOPMODEL,2006,"TOPMODEL is a semi-distributed hydrological model in which the distributed predictions of catchments response to rainfall are made. In this process of simulation, digital elevation models (DEM) is required to provide the values of parameters, such as topographic index, cumulative area of catchment and distance from catchment outlet; thus DEM play a dominant role in TOPMODEL implementation. Generally, DEM has inherent errors, referred to as DEM uncertainty. Lacking of knowledge about DEM errors, DEM data is often used in hydrological applications by using TOPMODEL without quantifying the effects of DEM uncertainty. In fact, the uncertainty of DEM may strongly influence the simulation results produced by TOPMODEL. Unfortunately, this effect is largely ignored in many empirical researches. This study aimed to examine the impacts of DEM uncertainty on the simulation results of TOPMODEL from the study area - Jiaokou watershed, a sub- basin with an area of 259 km 2  of the Yongjiang River in southeast China. This paper mainly discussed the effects in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. First, DEM uncertainty was simulated using the Monte Carlo method, and for every realization of the DEM, the topographic index, cumulative area of catchment and distance from catchment outlet were calculated. Second, TOPMODEL was tested and the results saved as the four statistical indices of the simulation: EFF (the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency criterion), SSE (Sum of squared residuals over all time steps), SLE (Sum of squared log residuals over all time steps) and SAE (Sum of absolute errors over all time steps) under the condition of seven storm events. Third, the statistic results - min, max, range, standard deviation, and Mean Value, of the four indices from the simulated DEM were compared in each case of flood and Mean value of the four indices were picked up to evaluate the effect of uncertainty of DEM on TOPMODEL. Finally, the simulation hydrographs were compared with the hydrographs using the original DEM under each flood event. The biggest errors for the indices of EFF, SSE, SLE, and SAE were 0.0169, 2.3x10 -5 , 1.1375, and 0.0033 respectively, which showed that the effect of DEM uncertainty on TOPMODEL was inconsiderable and could be ignored in the model's application."
2959988,21349,11104,Monitoring peat subsidence and carbon emission in Indonesia peatlands using InSAR time series,2016,"The tropical peatland is one of the largest terrestrial carbon stores. However, deforestation, drainage, fires and conversion development have progressed all over this region. Through both legal and illegal logging, and conversion to agricultural use over the period of 1985∼2006, about 12.1 M ha of peatland was deforested and drained in Southeast Asia, of which 1.5 M ha were tropical peat swamp forests in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia [1]. Those progressions result in decomposition of the surface peat and losing carbon to the atmosphere as CO2, which results in reducing their strength as a current C store and their capacity for future soil C storage. However, related quantitative estimation of CO 2  emission is limited. Using field-based surveying to monitoring peatland surface height changes over the large areas typical of drained in the past, is challenging such that measurments are more likely to describe a small area and be only a snapshot in time. Upscaling and understanding the rate of change in surface height trough time may be overcome using remote sensing approaches. Our objective is to investigate the peat subsidence and carbon emission by Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series. Here we present data on the change in peatland surface height in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, detected using the Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Small BAseline Set (SBAS) approach[2, 3]. Using data from December 2006 to September 2010, we have generated a map of the rate of change of mean height, and time series of change in drained peatland. To do this we used two independent ALOS L-band tracks SAR images, as there is a lack of ground data for validation, correlation in output provides confidence the results are representative. Our analysis to date shows that (Figure 1): 1) the rate of change in surface height (decrease) can vary; 2) the decrease in surface height can be up to −7.65 cm/year; 3) the largest decrease in surface height observed was 25 cm."
1816828,21349,11104,MODIS based continuous fields of tree cover using generalized linear models,2004,"Knowledge about the land cover over huge area is important for monitoring and modeling of ecological and environmental processes. Considerable efforts have recently resulted in the development of global continuous fields for different land cover types at small spatial scales based on NOAA-AVHRR and TERRA-MODIS data. Researchers have applied a range of techniques to depict the sub-pixel fraction of land cover types from remotely sensed data. As a result, such products have a high potential to accurately monitor land cover change overtime. In this study, a methodology is described for deriving and optimizing continuous fields of tree cover for complex topography at the regional scale of the European Alps using generalized linear models (GLM) which are commonly used in ecological research. The presented study is carried out in Switzerland a central part of the European Alps with a complex topography and a highly fragmented landscape. MODIS data (MOD09) at a spatial resolution of 500 m are used as explanatory variables and Landsat TM based data of fractional tree-cover are used as target variable to calibrate the GLM. For purpose of evaluation we calculated different accuracy measures of the resulting continuous fields of tree cover, and we compared the model output with two available global data sets: (1) TERRA-MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product (MOD44), and (2) the NOAA-AVHRR vegetation continuous fields. Our regionally optimized GLM model produces higher accuracies compared to MOD44- and AVHRR-products. The GLM model achieve an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.093, while the average MAE of the MOD44 and the AVHRR products are 0.205 and 0.200, respectively. We conclude that GLM's are appropriate for deriving fractional tree cover for complex topography at the scale of the European Alps. Regional calibrations of vegetation continuous fields may offer significantly improved predictions compared to globally calibrated models. Such regionally calibrated and optimized models may serve as valuable tools for regional monitoring of land cover pattern and its temporal change."

1985605,21349,11104,Meso-Scale Variability of Soils and Forest Canopy Properties is Connected to Geomorphologic Features in Eastern Amazonia,2006,"In this study we investigated the relationships between landscape features such as terrain elevation and slope with two variables that drives forest productivity, soil texture and leaf area index (LAI). The study was carried out at the Tapajos region in Para State, eastern Amazonia. Twenty-four 0.25 ha plots were sampled along a ~150 km north-south transect in October 2002. Soil samples were collected (0-10 cm) in three random points in each plot for texture analysis. LAI was measured at 25 points regularly distributed in each plot. The geomorphologic attributes for each plot were extracted from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data linearly resample to 10 m spatial resolution. Terrain slope was linear and negatively related to the soil clay content (r 2  =0.73). Soil sand content had an expected opposite pattern (r 2  =0.72). The soil content of clay and sand along the elevation gradient can be strongly explained by a cubic polynomial curve (r 2  =0.82 and 0.81, respectively). LAI showed to be a logarithmic function of slope (r 2 =0.61), excluding plots located in the Valley regions. Moreover, LAI showed a linear and positive relationship with soil clay content (r 2  =0.52). Similarly to the relationships found between terrain elevation and soil texture, the 3rd order polynomial could explain 64% of the LAI variability over the Tapajos. Therefore, we concluded that topography is a major driver of the patterns of soil texture at the landscape scale and the combined effect of topography and soil can largely explain the patterns of LAI over the Tapajos. The combination of SRTM data and field-based information has the potential to increase the accuracy of ecosystem scale estimations of forest productivity in the Amazonia."
2528398,21349,11104,An angular-dependent split-window equation for SST retrieval from off-nadir observations,2007,"An angular-dependent split-window equation is proposed for determining the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at any observation angle, including large viewing angles at the image edges of satellite sensors with wide swaths. The proposed equation takes into account the angular dependences of the atmospheric correction and also the emissivity correction. An explicit dependence on the SSE is considered in an independent term. The inclusion of such a term is not common in the current operational SST algorithms but we consider it appropriate taking into account the non-blackness of the sea surface emission for large angles and also the dependence on wind speed. The equation has been adapted to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on board EOS-Terra and EOS- Aqua, with at surface observation angles up to 65deg, and to the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board MSG, with even larger observation angles. Angular- dependent coefficients were estimated for the atmospheric and emissivity terms using synthetic data generated from a series of cloud-free, latitude-equally distributed radio sounding profiles. The use of the proposed expression requires as input data: at- sensor brightness temperatures for the split-window bands, the observation angle at each pixel, an estimate of the water vapor content and accurate SSE values for both channels. A comparison of the results of the equation for MODIS with in-situ measurements gathered from different NOAA ships and buoys placed around the world showed an accuracy of about plusmn 0.3 K for any observation angle, including off-nadir viewings, while the MODIS operational algorithm leaded to an error of plusmn 0.7 K at large angles. The proposed technique is mainly recommended to retrieve SST from observations at large viewing angles, since similar values are obtained by the current operational algorithms for nadir viewings."
741279,21349,11104,"A High-precision Method for Fractional Wheat Area Mapping based on SMA and Optimal Temporal Endmember Selection----A Case Study in Luancheng, North China Plain",2006,"A high-precision method for mapping the fraction of wheat Area in Luancheng County, North China Plain is presented and validated. The method is based on a spectral mixture analysis model and a optimal temporal TM image election where six main endmembers (greenhouse , soil, wheat, roof, nursery garden, shadow), constitute the observed pixel reflectance from the satellite. Given the reflectance observation, the fractional wheat area(FWA) is solved from the spectral mixture analysis(SMA) model. The high-precision estimation for six endmember SMA can be expected at an optional temporal range, which is the last ten days of March month every year. The simple landcover in March month specifies the effect of best simulation on the FWA of TM image pixels while no disturbed vegetations have grown green leaves. This approach enables operational wheat planting area mapping for extensive areas with an almost 95% classification precision to sub-pixel level. Our study area covers 346 km2. comprising whole Luancheng County of Hebei Province. Applying SMA to Landsat/TM cloud-free data acquired on March 21th, 2004, we estimated the areal fraction of wheat cover for the whole County field. The validation against statistical data from the Luancheng County Statistic Bureau indicates that with finite SMA, 92.3% accuracy is gained. Better results were also obtained from the validation against statistical information, for example, 95.8% of wheat-covered area were recognized when heavy haze area-free TM image is applied. A general formula for deriving the fractional wheat planting area mapping provided by SMA is presented, too. It can be concluded that wheat planting area to sub-pixel level in NCP can been operatively monitored with limited endmember SMA in a good precision."
2179168,21349,11104,"Monitoring of vegetation changes using multi-temporal NDVI in peripheral regions around minqin oasis, northwest china",2007,"Minqin Oasis encircled by the Badain Jaran Desert in north and Tengger Desert in east to south lies in the lower reach of Shiyang River Watershed, Northwest China. The peripheral desert ecological system around the oasis is quite important and absolutely necessary to the oasis economic systems in terms of protecting the oasis from desertification and ensuring sustainable development. However, the peripheral eco-system disturbed by human activities has been changed greatly since 1960s, bringing the great attention to the environment deterioration problems. In this study, Time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from seven Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite images were used quantitatively to monitor the vegetation change in peripheral regions around the Minqin Oasis. Based on field observation and re-adjustment, the TM-based NDVI values from 0 to 0.21 were classified as natural and artificial vegetation such as herbage, desert shrub, and landscapes such as semi-fixed sand dunes, fixed sand dunes and sand dunes, while the NDVI values more than 0.22 as the crops and shelter belt beside the crops. The variations of NDVI values less than 0.21 indicating the natural and human planted vegetation were analyzed. Results show that the areas of NDVI values ranging from 0.09- 0.14 indicating semi-fixed sand dunes planted perennial herbage and desert shrub have decreased gradually. The human planted shrubs (NDVI 0.15-0.21) have reduced in short time occurring during 1987-1991. While the areas indicating shifting sand dunes and inter-dunes planted annual or perennial herbages and scrubs (NDVI less than 0.09) fluctuated. The correlation analysis between NDVI and annual precipitation shows that NDVI is statistically correlated with the variations in the annual precipitation, implying that the precipitation-controlled natural vegetation coverage in the margins of the Minqin oasis has overshadowed the made-planted vegetation in dominating the ecological landscape since late 1980's."
2422437,21349,11104,Application of optical remote sensing imagery for detection of red tide algal blooms in Korean waters,2005,"The present study involves analyzing chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from SeaWiFS data collected over the period 1998-2002 to better understand the spatial and temporal aspects of red tide algal blooms created by Cochlodinium polykrikoides species in the enclosed and semi-enclosed bays of the South Sea of Korea. NOAA-AVHRR data is analyzed for sea surface temperature (SST) to elucidate physical factors affecting these aspects and abundance of Cochlodinium.p blooms. The time series Chl-a give an impression that recent red tide events with higher concentrations appear to have spanned more than 8 weeks in summer and fall seasons and were widespread in most of the South Sea coastal bays and neighboring ocean waters. The Chl-a estimates from SeaWiFS data appeared to be useful in demonstrating spatial and temporal aspects of these blooms, but uniquely identification of Cochlodinium.p from non-bloom and sediment dominated waters remains ineffective with these data. Thus the classical techniques such as Forward Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) and Minimum Spectral Distance (MSD) are attempted on both low spatial resolution SeaWiFS ocean color image data and high spatial resolution Landsat-7 ETM+ data. In September 2000, when an exchange of water masses took place off the southeastern coast, dense and mixed phases of the Cochlodinium.p blooms were conspicuous in the spectrally transformed SeaWiFS image. The existence of these phases inferred from SeaWiFS imagery was verified with both the atmospherically corrected and in-situ radiance spectra collected from these regions. Findings show that the application of SeaWiFS to uniquely identify Cochlodinium.p bloom from mixed and turbid plume was not feasible, but it was very effective with Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery detecting intricate and filament-like patterns of the Cochlodinium.p blooms and its dynamics owing to numerous physical mechanisms as determined by sea surface temperature from AVHRR infrared data."
1296340,21349,11104,Terrestrial total water storage dynamics of Australia's recent dry and wet events,2015,"Australia recently experienced a long-term continental drought (“big dry”, 2001–2009) followed by an anomalous wet two-year period (“big wet”, 2010–2011). Despite the significance of the two extreme events, continental-wide information regarding the effects of the high and low precipitation conditions on the hydrological components, stress and recovery is not available. In this paper, we use terrestrial total water storage changes (ATWS) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spanning from 2002 to 2013, where ATWS represents the main source of water available for human consumption, agriculture and natural ecosystems. We rely on a combination of temporal trend analysis and spatial statistics methods in order to evaluate the terrestrial total water storage (TWS) dynamics and the relationship between TWS and rainfall during the “big dry” and “big wet” events. Here we report the occurrence of hydrological cycle intensification during the study period in Australia which exhibited strong spatial variations: the wet areas (the northern and northeast regions) got wetter while the dry areas (the west and interior of the continent) became drier. By contrast, in southeastern Australia TWS changes over time showed sudden extreme responses to both events. Our results constitute a step beyond quantifying droughts/anomalous wet years that rely solely on precipitation data. This work demonstrates the ability of TWS observations as a significant indicator of hydrological system performance during hydroclimatic events and also an important tool for understanding continental-wide and regional spatial and temporal patterns of water availability."
2027074,21349,11104,"Evaluation of the altimetric information from RADARSAT-1, ASTER and SRTM data for topographic mapping in the Amazon Region",2007,"Brazilian Amazon is a vast territory rich in natural renewable and non-renewable resources. Due to the adverse environmental condition (rain, cloud, dense vegetation, poor access), topographic information is still poor, and when available needs to be up-dated or re-mapped. In this paper, the feasibility of using altimetric information for topographic mapping through orbital stereoscopic (ASTER, RADARSAT-1) and interferometric (SRTM-3) DEMs (digital elevation models) was investigated for two regions in the Brazilian Amazon: Tapajos National Forest (flat terrain) and Serra dos Carajas (mountainous relief). The quality of information produced from these data was evaluated regarding field altimetric measurements. Precise topographic field information acquired from differential global positioning system (DGPS) was used as Ground Control Points (GCPs) for the modeling of the stereoscopic DEMs and as independent check points (ICPs) for the calculation of altimetric accuracies of the products. The investigation has shown that the accuracy of the altimetric information derived from Fine RADARSAT-1, ASTER and SRTM-3 DEMs met the requirements for a semi-detailed (1:100,000-map) scale as requested by the Brazilian standard for cartographic accuracy. Furthermore, SRTM-3 DEM was more accurate than stereoscopic DEMs. The additional great advantage of using SRTM-3 is the free access data. However, up-dated planimetric information is also necessary for cartographic production. Thus it is suggested a combination of altimetry derived for SRTM-3 and planimetry from high-resolution SAR (Fine RADARSAT-1, PALSAR) or if possible optical data (ASTER, SPOT) for topographic mapping at semi-detailed scale in similar environments of the Brazilian Amazon, where terrain information is seldom available or presents low quality."
642303,21349,11104,New methods for landslide identification and mapping using SAR polarimetry obtained during the PacRim 2000 mission in Taiwan,2005,"Abstract : We reanalyze PacRim 2000 L-band AIRSAR polarimetry collected over the western foothills of central Taiwan a year after the September 20, 1999 ChiChi earthquake, which produced more than 10,000 landslides. The objective is to explore the utility of SAR data, particularly polarimetry, for identifying and mapping natural hazards like landslides that essentially resurface landscapes. An overall goal of this research is to exploit the operational advantages of radars over optical instruments for rapid assessment and response to natural hazards and disasters. Three flightlines of XTI1 AIRSAR were acquired over the two largest landslides, Tsaoling and Mt. Juo-feng-err, as well as hundreds of smaller slides generated by the ChiChi main and aftershocks. We first looked at the relative utility of single channel (co-polarized) SAR, dual polarimetry (co- and cross-polarized channels), and full polarimetry for landslide identification. We found that landslides are very difficult to recognize in fixed polarization SAR data. On the other hand, recognizing hillsides cleared of vegetation by landslides is relatively easy with dual and fully polarimetric data by using cross-polarized and co-polarized cross-sections to provide radar vegetation indices. Radar target decomposition methods applied to the L-band polarimetry allowed us to explore the changes in scattering mechanisms induced by the action of landsliding on forested hillslopes, and to use derived polarimetric parameters to identify landslides. Application of speckle reduction filters does not degrade the resolution with which small landslides can be mapped. Finally, we explored unsupervised classification methods for efficient mapping of landslides under a rapid response mode of operation."
2504583,21349,11104,A description of the data-driven SAR data workflow in the TerraSAR-X Payload Ground Segment,2004,"TerraSAR-X is a national German satellite providing a high-resolution X-Band SAR instrumentation featuring StripMap, ScanSAR and SpotLight imaging modes in various polarizations. The experimental full polarization mode is carried out using a dual receive antenna capability. An active lifetime of five years is anticipated, the launch is expected in 2006. The TerraSAR-X mission serves both commercial and scientific needs. It is implemented in the frame of a public-private partnership between EADS Astrium GmbH (providing the TerraSAR-X Space Segment) and the German Aerospace Center DLR (providing the TerraSAR-X Ground Segment). The commercial product exploitation rights are with Infoterra GmbH, the scientific ones remain at DLR. The Infoterra business concept foresees the inclusion of a Direct Access Service through which TerraSAR-X data may be directly received by stations either for the sole purpose to produce geo-information products for their own and private applications or to generate and distribute commercial products. Essential tasks of the TerraSAR-X Payload Ground Segment developed (and later operated) by DLR are the SAR payload data reception, their archiving and processing, and the distribution of the generated SAR products to users. This paper summarizes the TerraSAR-X Payload Ground Segment design. It describes the SAR data workflow ranging from the payload data reception at the Neustrelitz Ground Station to the long-term data archiving in the multi-mission Product Library at the German Remote Sensing Data Center. Supplementary data as provided by the TerraSAR-X Mission Operation Segment and used during the data-driven generation of the SAR level 0 products are described together with their dissemination concept. The adaptability of the chosen approach for the operation of a Direct Access Station is addressed"
1128458,21349,11104,Hydrometeor classification for X-band dual polarization radar on-board civil aircrafts,2015,"Polarimetric techniques applied to radars on-board civil aircraft can improve the estimation of risk zones due to dangerous weather during flight. Usually, X-band weather radars are installed at the nose of civil aircrafts. This band is affected by strong attenuation in case of intense precipitation (liquid or mixed phase). The current systems do not compensate backscattered power measurements for attenuation caused by propagation through precipitation, while dual-polarization radars are able to compensate effectively this source of error and to discriminate hydrometeors. In this work, a classification algorithm based on support vector machines (SVM) is proposed. Training is driven by the output of a Fuzzy Logic (FL) classification algorithm (typical classification approach used for ground-based weather radar). SVM high performance in terms of time processing and its flexibility of configuration using all type of inputs variables are important characteristics to be included in some avionic specific equipment, such as the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). Two datasets have been used to test the SVM classification algorithm. The first dataset is composed of simulated radar polarimetric observations at X-band and the second one is composed of actual dual-polarization radar measurements collected during the Special Observation Period (SOP) 1.1 of HYdrological cycle in MEditerranean EXperiment (Hymex) campaign by the C-band Doppler dual-polarization weather radar (Polar 55C) installed at ISAC-CNR in Rome. Good performance are obtained for SVM classificator. The comparison with FL output shows a good agreement (up to 90%) both in qualitative comparison maps by maps and using a quantitative approach which metric is based on the confusion matrix."
2342142,21349,11104,Elevation and Freeboard Changes of Ross Sea Ice and Ice Shelf using Icesat,2006,"In this paper, ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite)-based estimates of sea ice and ice shelf elevation change and the sea ice freeboard changes in the Ross Sea Region of west Antarctic were studied. To process the data, a 3-step procedure was developed. ICESat datasets of three releases were used for the study: laser 1 and laser 2A (2003) and laser 3D (2005). It was found that all of them have suspect elevation data and extensive quality control was needed to remove the suspect points before a bias-free surface could be generated. Also obtained sea-ice freeboard from ICESat elevation data showed unusual negative results. Simple, universe, and ordinary kriging interpolations as well as inverse distance weights interpolation were tested and evaluated. It is found that the ordinary kriging method based on an unknown mean performed the best and achieved the smallest RMS prediction error (< 1 m) based on cross-validation technique. Seasonal elevation changes of the two complete datasets (laser 1 and laser 2A) have been analyzed and results indicate that (1) the mean elevation of sea ice increased about 0.89 m, with a mean increase of 0.55 m for the sea ice/ice shelf transition zone; (2) the mean elevation of the ice sheet decreased about 0.17 m; (3) maximum elevation of sea ice increased 1.13 m; (4) maximum elevation of ice shelf increased 5.36 m; (5) the transitional region has the largest elevation change: ~60 % of the region shown 48 to 20 m decreases, only small portions shown 20- 40 m increases. Inter-annual elevation changes obtained from laser 2A and laser 3D for sea ice indicate that (1) minimum surface elevation has decreased as 5.27 m with increase of mean surface about 0.12 m; (2) maximum surface elevation from Austral spring 2003 to spring 2005 has decreased as 12.69 m. It is suggested that the freeboard directly resulted from ICESat data has large negative values and needs better geoid or mean sea surface."
2207221,21349,11104,Operational airborne hyperspectral remote sensing for global geothermal exploration,2004,"Airborne hyperspectral technology' has progressed to global implementation possibilities for geothermal exploration and assessment. This work describes the unique capabilities of hyperspectral imagers as they pertain to the mapping and characterization of geothermal regions including both geological and biological material mapping. Many of the geological processes, phenomena and products (such as alteration) associated with regions of high geothermal gradients can be imaged, measured, geospatially placed and identified accurately and precisely over large, contiguous areas in virtually any region of the globe by aircraft-mounted imaging spectrometers such as HyMap. For example traditional drilling and field surveys provide extensive mineralogical data at depth and over very small areas. Such activities are considered mandatory in any geothermal exploration program. However hyperspectral remote sensing has the capability to accurately map continuous surface mineralogy over very large areas at small spatial scales (eg. siliceous sinter, travertine or alunite distribution). While resource satellites such as Landsat and ASTER do provide global coverage of basic geology at relatively low spatial resolutions (15-30 m) and low spectral resolutions (40-700 nm), directed high spatial and spectral resolution airborne surveys with HyMap (3-5 m spatial and 13-17 nm spectral) afford incomparable material map generation capabilities. These include not only the specific mineral identification maps discussed above, but also mineral chemistry measurements, proxy temperature estimates and associated geobotanical measurements and distribution maps (that include not only types of vegetation but also relative physiological state)."
2236099,21349,11104,Science Data Products for Public Health Decision Support,2006,"The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering an enhanced syndromic surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the southwestern United States based on assimilating Earth observation (EO) data from NASA experimental satellites. There is a rich literature describing the roles and benefits of using EO data in public health, but most of the documentation is based on anecdotal inferences derived from traditional image interpretation. For several reasons, public health communities cannot rely on evidence of this type because: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that can deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly. In PHAiRS, several data sets are being assimilated as replacement parameters in the Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM) to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement as governed by hourly weather variables available in a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP/Eta) model. On-going simulations from DREAM measure hourly, daily and weekly model improvements from individual EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c) develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a reliable respiratory public health syndromic surveillance system that can be translated into routine uses of EO data from future NPOESS sensors."
2345425,21349,11104,Spatial temporal geographic ontology,2007,"Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being. Ontology is currently used by philosophers, information scientists and psychologists. A sharing ontology is required for communicating between the communicating participants. And the formal description of ontology is fundamental to data exchange standards. In recent years, ontology has been used by geographers. Many researchers have recognized the importance of geographic categories, and the relationships and interactions between geographic categories. Geographic objects are intrinsically tied to space and exist at some time. In the geographic realm, cognitive categories expose certain special features of geographic objects at surveyable scale. And that these features denote the specific ontological characteristics of geographical objects. At the same time, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of time, and time has been an integral part of geographical information science. Thus, the research of geographic ontology must involve a fully spatio- temporal view of our world, in other words, it is about spatial temporal geographic ontology. In this paper, firstly, it reviews the recently research of geographic ontology of many experts. And it mainly explores that what is the geographic ontology and what are the research contents of geographic ontology, and how to construct an geographic ontology? The domain of geographic ontology contains objects, relations, boundaries, events, processes, qualities, and quantities of all sorts. Geographic objects are typically complex, and they will in every case have parts. An adequate ontology of geographic objects must therefore contain a theory of part and whole, or mereology. And that an adequate ontology of geographic objects must contain also a topology, a theory of boundaries and interiors, of connectedness and separation, that is integrated with a mereological theory of parts and wholes. Secondly, the paper investigates the three levels of reality: the spatial reality, the cognitive reality and geographic reality. Then it considers that geographic cognition is the key factor of geographic category. Geographic categories are related to natural, cultural, and fiat element, et al. Thirdly, in this section, the research is about an spatial temporal geographic ontology that contains space and time. The paper discusses the spatial classification and the temporal categories of geographic phenomena. Spatial objects based on object or field, which are continuants or discrete, must be represented suitably by geographic ontology. Temporal analogue of objects: there are events and processes of various kinds. Processes and events are the key elements that describe dynamic action of spatial temporal geographic objects. With the introduction of time, the requirement to take heed of the manifold interconnections between the spatial and the temporal must be proposed. The geographic phenomena can be represented as spatial or temporal, and as continuants or discrete, and as events or processes. These categories are not exist in isolation from one another. Spatial and temporal are restricted each other and represent the dynamic geographical phenomena all together. Lastly, the paper concludes that spatial temporal geographic ontology must take heed of the manifold interconnections between the spatial and the temporal and in the future a technical infrastructure be needed to provide a basis for GIS."
1597877,21349,11104,Development of microwave vegetation index from multi-sensor observations,2013,"Microwave Vegetation Indices(MVIs) are newly developed vegetation indices using microwave remote sensing data (SMOS, WindSat, and AMSR-E, respectively). SMOS operates at L-band, in dual polarization and a range of viewing angles. WindSat is a satellite-based multi-frequency and multi-angle polarimetric microwave radiometer with the same transit time as SMOS. Establishing a synergetic vegetation index with WindSat and SMOS data will provide multi-angle and multi-frequency information in vegetation monitoring. As the deducations of previous indices are based on single senor configuration, it is necessary to demonstrate the applicability of the synergy for these two sensors. From the previous research, we found that bare soil emissivities at adjacent frequencies or angles exhibited a good linear relationship under Gaussian correlation function. Whether this relationship exists for L-band and C-band and for Exponential correlation function has to be deeply explored. With this objective, we have built a simulation database using the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) at L-band (SMOS, 1.4GHz, multi-angle) and C-band ( WindSat, 6.8GHz, 53.5°) in dual-polarization (v and h), respectively. The relationships of the surface emissivities are significantly different, while the fresnel reflectivity exhibits linear relationship. Hence, we consider using fresnel reflectivity to establish the bridge between different sensors. The radiation of vegetated land surface can be described by a 0th-order radiative transfer model. The total emission from ground can be rearranged into a linear model with the vegetation emission component as the intercept and the vegetation transmission component as the slope. With this linear relationship, the Fresnel reflectivity at one frequency can be expressed as a linear function of that at another frequency. And the intercept and the slope are the newly derived vegetation indices. They are mainly affected by vegetation properties and have a consistent spatial pattern with NDVI."
1876443,21349,11104,"A study of dense medium scattering and its applications in sea ice research in ross island, antarctica",2011,"This paper summarizes the study of dense medium scattering and its applications towards sea ice research in Ross Island, Antarctica. Based on the Radiative Transfer Theory and earlier work by Tjuatja and Fung, an improvement to the phase matrix to account for the near field effects of electrically dense media was developed, called the Dense Medium Phase and Amplitude Correction Theory (DM-PACT). An analysis on the scattering of discrete scatterers in an electrically dense medium was carried out and a backscattering model based on the iterative solution of Radiative Transfer Theory, incorporating both the DM-PACT and the IEM model to characterize for rough surface was later developed. With the concern on climate change, the study shifted towards the application of dense medium scattering on sea ice and ice shelf. Using ground truth measurement data collected from Ross Island, Antarctica to compute the backscattering coefficient with the developed forward model, a good matching was obtained between the model predictions and the satellite measurements from RADARSAT. The model was then extended to incorporate multiple layers to take into account the effect of the snow layer on top of the sea ice. A good matching was obtained between the multi-layer model, the Matrix Doubling Method and the CEAREX measurements. From here, the research moved towards the development of inverse models for the purpose of sea ice thickness retrieval due to the parameter's importance in the study of climate change. For active remote sensing, the Radiative Transfer Inverse Scattering Model (RTISM), utilizing the RT-DMPACT forward model and Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization Algorithm was proposed. Initial results with the model showed good matching between measurement data and model predictions. For passive microwave remote sensing, two models were proposed for sea ice thickness retrieval: the training of neural networks using the RT-DMPACT forward model and the use of Genetic Algorithm for sea ice thickness retrieval. Both methods showed promise and the results were encouraging."
2508840,21349,11104,WindSat validation datasets: an overview,2004,"Since the January 6, 2003 launch of the Naval Research Laboratory satellite Coriolis, the WindSat instrument onboard has provided over a year of unprecedented polarimetric microwave measurements of the globe. The WindSat radiometer has five operating frequencies at 6.8, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 37 GHz, with the 10.7, 18.7, and 37 GHz channels providing fully polarimetric signals. The primary mission of Coriolis is to exploit the unique information provided by WindSat's polarimetric capabilities to retrieve the complete ocean surface wind vector (speed and direction), though the retrieval of numerous other environmental parameters is being actively pursued as well. As part of a pre-NPOESS risk reduction effort, the NOAA/NESDIS/Office of Research and Applications has been collaborating with the Naval Research Laboratory's Remote Sensing Division in the calibration/validation of WindSat in preparation for the release of WindSat data products to the scientific and operational communities. An extensive overview is presented of the WindSat calibration/validation effort being put forth at NOAA/NESDIS and the associated comparison databases constructed for that purpose. These databases include data of WindSat measurements collocated with measurements from oceanographic buoys, ships, other satellites, and global data assimilation models. The strengths and limitations of these various datasets will be discussed in detail. This includes a synopsis of the colocation strategies used in matchup database construction for comparing WindSat measurements with other satellite based measurements, focusing particularly on similar orbit SSM/I data and its use in brightness temperature calibration. In addition, the use of NCEP's Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) as a powerful source of plentiful comparison data is explored, particularly with regard to WindSat model function development"
2950018,21349,11104,Data fusion of sea surface height anomaly from HY-2A AND Jason-2,2016,"Altimeter provides a unique perspective to observe global ocean frequently which is never happened before. Whereas the altimeter measures the ocean in a narrow track, it is inconvenient in studying the ocean structures such as Kuroshio and Gulf Stream, let alone the mesoscale structures which are important ways to transport mass and energy. These ocean structures determined by sea surface topography (SST) can be estimated using altimeter data. In this study, we present a fusion result of altimetry data by combining HY-2A and Jason-2. The merged data, generated using optimal interpolation (OI), present a detailed description for mesoscale structures in Kuroshio area. In this study, (1) altimetry data for both HY-2A and Jason-2 employed to determine sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) are corrected using collected independent source including European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data, TPXO ocean tide model etc. (2) in order to further enrich the details of mesoscale structures, altimetry data from other ongoing mission including Cryosate-2 and SARAL/Altika are take into account. (3) to ensure accuracy of the fusion, observation bias of sea surface heights from HY-2A are corrected to align with the reference mission Jason-2 using cross-calibration, since Jason-2 have been calibrated stringently. The relative biases for HY-2A, SARAL/Altika and Cryosate-2 are 37.36cm, −4.54cm and − 72.5cm and the corresponding standard deviations are 5.58cm, 5.26cm and 5.02 cm respectively, which suggest accurate observations and reliable reprocessing. (4) optimal interpolation is used to perform the interpolation, thus generate SSHA with grid format which are easy to distinguish the mesoscale structures. (5) more details are introduced from multi-missions rather than one."
2549194,21349,11104,Microwave remote sensing: a perspective from the last few field experiments,2004,"There have been numerous field experiments which have tested the effectiveness of microwave remote sensing, both active and passive under varied land surface conditions. The Southern Great Plains Experiment 1999 (SGP99) was held in Chickasha Oklahoma where winter wheat and rangeland was the predominant land surface type whereas at the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) in Walnut River watershed in Ames Iowa it was a mixture of corn, and soyabeans. In the SMEX03 (Soil Moisture Experiment in 2003) in Little River Watershed, the land surface was a mixture of peanuts, vegetables, cotton and pasture and for SMEX04 (Soil Moisture Experiment in 2004) in Walnut Gulch, Arizona, the land surface cover is primarily brush and grass covered rangeland vegetation. Given that microwaves have low sensitivity to soil moisture in the presence of vegetation, these field experiments offer an opportunity to examine observations of sensitivity in the presence of varied (and varying with time) vegetation densities. In addition, in each of these experiments, there were different instruments on aircrafts and satellite sensors that were deployed. In SGP99, we had observations from the PALS (Passive Active L and S band Radar and Radiometer), PSR (Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer) from the C130 aircraft and the TMI (TRMM Microwave Imager) and SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) from space. In SMEX02, we had PALS, PSR, AIRSAR (Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar) from the aircraft platforms and in SMEX03 PSR only. Satellite sensors in SMEX02 and SMEX03 included AMSR (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer), TMI, and SSM/I. In the recently concluded SMEX04, PSR was used from the aircraft and AMSR, TMI and SSM/I satellite observations were available. We will use these sensors and observations in the microwave channel in conjunction with ground observations of vegetation characteristics and soil moisture to study the sensitivity of microwaves to soil moisture under varied land surface conditions."
2529469,21349,11104,Derivation and application of dyadic Green's functions for planarly layered biaxial media,2004,"Derivation of the electric field dyadic Green's function for layered anisotropic media has been a subject of interest for decades. Methods employed include state space techniques, spectral representations, eigenvector function expansions, and various combinations of these techniques. In general the solutions are complex and require the representation of an integral kernel in terms of an appropriately defined dyadic or matrix. Interface boundaries are typically aligned with Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates in order to take advantage of the known basis functions for the geometries. Initially Lee and Kong and subsequently Mudaliar and Lee presented formulations of the unbounded dyadic Green's functions that were derived using a symmetric dyadic integral kernel that utilized the electric field vectors present in the media. Once the dyadic Green's functions are determined, one can apply convolution to determine the electric field in the field region. The resulting triple integral can be reduced by 1) assuming a Hertzian dipole excitation and by 2) applying any one of the asymptotic analysis techniques available, such as the method of steepest descent or the stationary phase method to reduce the integral to a simple vector equation. In the present work, we develop closed form expressions for the radiation pattern of a Hertzian dipole placed above both a single isotropic-biaxial interface as well as a two layer isotropic-biaxial geometry for those points not too close to the interface. The Green's function presented by Mudaliar and Lee is used in the two layer analysis. A dyadic Green's function for the half space geometry is also derived. The solution and the numerical calculations 'were verified by comparing the half space transmission and reflection coefficients as well as the radiation pattern data with reflection coefficients and electric field pattern data obtained by Ergolu and King and Sandier for uniaxial and isotropic planarly layered geometries, respectively. The results showed excellent agreement"
2466495,21349,11104,Recent Advances in Polarimetry and Polarimetric Interferometry,2006,"Radar polarimetry radar Interferometry and polarimetric SAR interferometry represent the current culmination in 'microwave remote sensing' technology, but we still need to progress very considerably in order to reach the limits of physical realizability. Whereas with radar polarimetry the textural fine-structure, target orientation, symmetries and material constituents can be recovered with considerable improvement above that of standard 'amplitude-only' radar; by implementing 'radar interferometry' the spatial (in depth) structure can be explored. With polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar (POL-IN-SAR) imaging, it is possible to recover such co-registered textural and spatial information from POL-IN-SAR digital image data sets simultaneously, including the extraction of digital elevation maps (DEM) from either polarimetric (scattering matrix) or interferometric (dual antenna) SAR systems. Simultaneous polarimetric-plus-interferometric SAR imaging offers the additional benefit of obtaining co-registered textural-plus-spatial three-dimensional POL-IN-DEM information, which when applied to repeat-pass image-overlay interferometry provides differential background validation and environmental stress-change information with highly improved accuracy. Then, by either designing multiple dual polarization antenna POL-IN-SAR systems or by applying advanced POL-IN-SAR image compression techniques, will result in 'POL-arimetric TOMO-graphic' (multi-interferometric) SAR or POL-TOMO-SAR imaging. By advancing these EWB-D-POL-IN/TOMO-SAR imaging modes, we are slowly but steadily approaching the ultimate goal of eventually realizing airborne and spaceborne 'geo-environmental background validation, stress assessment, and stress-change monitoring and wide-area military surveillance of the terrestrial and planetary covers'."
1388208,21349,11104,SAIRPS: A generic simulator for evaluation of synthetic aperture interferometric radiometers,2013,"ESA's SMOS mission has been a cornerstone in passive Earth Observation, since it has provided for the first time ever with global and frequent observations of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (where the mission acronym comes from). SMOS' single payload is MIRAS: the Microwave Imaging Radiometers by Aperture Synthesis in two dimensions. After SMOS' success, today, a number of instruments are planned or under study: the GeoStar instrument is the baseline payload for the Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission from NASA (USA), the Geostationary Atmospheric Sounder (GAS) instrument is under study for post-MSG operational satellites observations (Europe), and the Geostationary Interferometric Microwave Sounder (GIMS) instrument from NSSC-CAS (China). The study of the instrument performance in terms of angular resolution and radiometric performance (radiometric sensitivity and accuracy), and the optimization of this new type of instruments is a complex task that requires dedicated ad-hoc tools. In this work the SAIRPS (Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radiometer Performance Simulator) is presented. This complex simulator allows to analyze arbitrary receiver topologies, arbitrary array geometries, and includes noise injection calibration algorithms, and new external robust calibration algorithms, and image reconstruction algorithms that allow to evaluate the performance of almost any instrument. At present, the full simulator has been coded in Matlab, translated into C++, and integrated in OpenSF. This work summarizes the key aspects of the architecture of this simulator, completing the presentation made in IGARSS 2012, and presents a few examples of the simulation results using different instrument configurations."
2179747,21349,11104,Data Access Tools - Filling the Usability Gap in Cryosphere Data,2008,"The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) houses the NASA-sponsored Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), providing data and information services to the cryospheric research community. By far the most popular data served by the NSIDC DAAC are derived from Earth-observing remote sensing instruments aboard polar orbiting satellites. These instruments include Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), and Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Observations made by these Earth-observing sensors are a valuable resource for polar researchers. However, the Earth science community, and in particular the polar research community, often have problems accessing data that are suitable for a specific study. These difficulties range from accessing data from large-volume archives to effectively using the data upon delivery. NSIDC's responsibility is to facilitate the user's data acquisition experience by reducing the inefficiencies in data discovery and by providing data users with software utilities that assist the scientist with using the delivered data. NSIDC and a group of collaborators have proposed to create an advanced multi-faceted web service for data access, browse, overlay, manipulation, and delivery that integrates several important data sets for cryospheric analysis. The services we propose will directly address the several data access issues that impede progress in our under.standing of climate change in the Polar Regions."
1955659,21349,11104,Evaluation of irrigation water amount in semi-arid croplands using time series of FORMOSAT-2 images,2009,"Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water worldwide, and especially in semi-arid areas such as southern Mediterranean countries. Agricultural water use is difficult to estimate over large areas, since several irrigation networks may co-exist and since farmers operate private pumping stations. In this context, the objective of this work was to estimate irrigation through the combination of a crop/water balance model and optical remote sensing data. The methodology was tested on a 2800 ha irrigated area located in the Tensift-Marrakech plain, central Morocco. Remote sensing data consists in the time series of FORMOSAT-2 images. This sensor operates in four bands (blue to near infrared) and allows to acquire daily images at 8m spatial resolution. Images are used in conjunction with a simple crop model to monitor the nature of crops, their phenological states and the average level of water stress. This information and other ground data (soil map, climatic data) are introduced into a water balance model, to estimate irrigation at the pixel resolution. The results are evaluated over irrigation units (25 to 200 ha size) with data collected by the regional agency in charge of the distribution of dam water. At a seasonal scale, the accumulated irrigation water was found to vary between 0 and 300 mm, with accuracy of 25%. The approach may offer perspectives for a better estimate of the quantity of ground water used for agriculture. Indeed, it works without requiring any a priori data on agricultural practices. This makes it very attractive for operational application at a regional scale."
1929535,21349,11104,An fast integrated searching strategy and application in multi-source massive image database for Disaster Mitigation and Relief,2007,"Disaster mitigation and relief (DMR) has been paid much more attention from national or local governments in China. Multi-source remotely sensed data with different spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions were widely applied in DMR (e.g. disaster warning, rapid response, loss evaluation and reconstruction, etc.), and have been a main data source in the database of DMR Although some famous remote sensing image database engines have the power to organize, store and manage massive image data, their searching efficiency in massive imagery is poor because of the fact that the temporal, spatial and spectral attributes were not taken account in their image database construction procedure. Especially for the preprocessed imagery used in DMR, the common image management software packages usually store and manage them as individual scene depending upon the catalog. It leads to a low efficiency for searching and accessing images. In this study, a novel fast integrated searching strategy (FISS) was proposed and a set of grid indexes were designed to project multi-dimensional image data with multi-temporal, multispectral and multispatial resolutions to the 2-D space. The required image data at different locations for any acquired dates, spectral and spatial resolutions could be rapidly searched by different dimensional indexes. In order to improve the speed and efficiency of data access, the preprocessed images were divided into tiles and compressed. FISS makes the system be interactive and more convenient to the users. It has been used in disaster mitigation and relief database of disaster reduction in China. In this paper, the proposed searching technique was compared with traditional ones, the results showed that FISS could accelerate searching speed, shorten disaster emergency response time."
1838279,21349,11104,Post-fire vegetation phenology in Siberian burn scars,2007,"Boreal forests comprise one third of global forested area and are the largest terrestrial carbon store. Forest fires are the regions most dynamic disturbance factor, occurring mainly in Siberia, Russian Far East, Canada and Alaska, and these fires represent a globally important release of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere, via the burning of vegetation and organic soils. Currently the boreal region is believed to be a net carbon sink, but climate change predictions indicate significant boreal warming, with consequent increases in fire activity and carbon release. Ultimately, the boreal zone may become a net carbon source through forest fires and increased soil decomposition, and there is evidence that the Canadian forest may have already made this transition. Critical to estimating both direct and longer-term fire-related perturbations to boreal carbon storage is knowledge of fire extent, intensity and/or type, which has a strong control on forest fire damage, the fraction of available fuel combusted, and patterns of post-fire re-growth. These variables are currently derived from model-based assessment of often-uncertain accuracy, introducing large uncertainties to current carbon flux calculations. The post-fire re-growth process is of great importance since whilst fire releases carbon into the atmosphere, carbon sequestration through post-fire regeneration of plants and woody vegetation may help to reduce the amounts of carbon in the atmosphere. Observational data, such as vegetation indices, biophysical vegetation parameters, burnt area and fire radiative power, derived from satellite measurements are exploited to investigate post-fire regeneration and pre and post-fire temporal dynamics in the boreal forest. The relationship between post-fire dynamics and variables such as fire intensity, vegetation cover and climate are investigated. The ultimate aim of the proposed work is to improve insight into the Siberian boreal forest post-fire dynamics, leading to more realistic carbon flux quantification in the boreal biome and subsequently to a better quantitative understanding of the role of boreal forest regeneration in the global atmospheric carbon record."
2466012,21349,11104,Variable wind influence on InSAR imagery of forests,2009,"The horizontal and vertical (3D) structure of Earth's forested ecosystems are of great significance to their ecological functioning and societal uses. An InSAR approach is one methodology whereby a forest's structure and height in particular can be successfully estimated. Critical to the successful estimation is a high correlation between multiple SAR images. Regardless of a forest's location on the Earth, wind can significantly alter a forest's appearance to an L-band SAR system and so decrease this necessary correlation. In order to investigate the wind-induced decorrelation, we have developed a model for the repeat-pass interferometric SAR response of a forested area taking into account wind effects. The simulation consists of multiple interconnected parts including static tree geometry's generation, a wind simulator to apply to a static tree, and an electromagnetic model to allow us to calculate the interferometric SAR response. The static tree geometry generation process generates a pseudo-random tree based on a given DNA file which specifies a species specific structure. This geometry is then modified by the wind simulator producing snapshots of tree-geometry as a function of time. Each snapshot is then used in the interferometric SAR simulator to synthesize the wind-blown geometry's InSAR response. Results present coherence as a function of wind speed and forest structure. An important feature of this research is the usage of a physically based realistic wind model that is based on measurements of wind effects on trees as well as realistic models of fluid flow and simple harmonic branch resonators. Allowing branches to bend and move out of the plane of the incident wind field enables our model to capture numerous features of a physical tree blowing in the wind. This realistic model is necessary for a realistic simulation of the effects that wind has on a given InSAR imaging system."
1855757,21349,11104,Coverage opportunities for global ocean color in a multimission era,1998,"The international community, recognizing the importance of global ocean color observations in the global carbon cycle, has proposed or flown six global ocean color missions over the next decade: the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFs), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer-AM (MODIS-AM), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Global Imager (GLI), and MODIS-PM. Each of these missions contains the spectral band complement considered necessary to derive oceanic pigment concentrations (i.e., phytoplankton abundance). This paper assesses whether assembling and merging data from these missions can improve ocean coverage, since clouds and Sun glint prevent any single satellite from observing more than about 15% of the ocean surface in a single day, and whether new information about diel cycles of phytoplankton abundance is possible. Extensive numerical analysis, given the orbit and sensor characteristics of each mission, showed that merging data form three satellites can produce better ocean coverage in less time. Data from three satellites can improve coverage by 58% for a single day, including the obscuring effects of clouds and sun glint. Thus, observation of approximately 25% of the ocean can be provided, instead of only about 15-16% from a single satellite. After four days, approximately 62% of the ocean surface was observed, an increase from 43% observed by a single satellite. The addition of more satellites produced diminishing returns. Since the proposed missions have different orbits, the view the same location of the ocean at different times of day. This leads to the possibility of using data from the set of six missions to help understand diel phytoplankton dynamics."
625740,21349,11104,To separate mixed pixel temperature using differential coefficient of pixel mixed temperature to vegetation fractional cover,2005,"This Two-layer surface fluxes model is suitable to inhomogenous soil-vegetation surface. The key step is to separate mixed pixel surface temperature. ATSR's sensor can provide two view angles for separating the temperature. However, the areas are different between the pixel at nadir view and the pixel at forward view, which would result in some errors. Furthermore, re-sampling will reduce the spatial resolution of remote sensing data. On the other hand, remote sensing data source used widely now do not provide multi-angular data, which also limits the wide use of this method. An alternative method for separating mixed pixel temperature is proposed in this paper. A different T-m2 similar to f(2) equation is established using the derivative of pixel mixed temperature to vegetation fractional cover (dT(m)/df). Combining with original T-m1 similar to f(1) equation the mixed pixel temperature can he separated. A pixel component arranging comparing method will be used to obtain (dTm/df). The essence of the method is to obtain (dTm/df) using slopes of a trapezium. The principle of this method is similar to the multi-angular method. And the method overcomes the uncertainty due to the different area measured in two view angles. Theoretical positioning algorithm of four extreme pixel temperatures in the trapezium is presented to overcome uncertainty of previous method. We did a series of experimentsin Beijing and Yucheng remote sensing experimental stations, and the results indicated that this algorithm is suitable for the purpose. The above methods were adopted to separate mixed pixel temperature in two-layer surface flux model using MODIS data and simultaneous measurements in Dongping Lake, Shandong province of China. Distribution images of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration were obtained in North China. The method and algorithm are feasible and reasonable according to good agreements' between predicted and measured values."
1759127,21349,11104,Tandem-L: A mission proposal for monitoring dynamic earth processes,2011,"Tandem-L is a mission proposal for an innovative interferometric L-band radar instrument that enables the systematic monitoring of dynamic Earth processes using advanced techniques and technologies. The mission is science driven aiming to provide a unique data set for climate and environmental research, geodynamics, hydrology and oceanography. Important application examples are global forest height and biomass inventories, measurements of Earth deformation due to tectonic processes and/or anthropogenic factors, observations of ice/glacier velocity field and 3-D structure changes, and the monitoring of soil moisture and ocean surface currents. The Tandem-L mission concept consists of two cooperating satellites flying in close formation. The Pol-InSAR and repeat-pass acquisition modes provide a unique data source to observe, analyse and quantify a wide range of mutually interacting processes in the bio-, litho-, hydro- and cryosphere. The systematic observation of these processes benefits from the high data acquisition capacity and the novel high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging modes that combine digital beamforming with a large reflector antenna. This paper provides an overview of the Tandem-L mission concept and its main application areas. It is planned to realise the Tandem-L mission in cooperation with NASA/JPL. The mission concept was developed in detail in a joint two-year pre-phase A study and it will be further studied in the next 18 months. This will allow a cost-effective implementation, whereby each partner contributes its predevelopments and experience. According to current planning, the Tandem-L satellites could be launched in 2019."
1412979,21349,11104,TerraSAR-X pixel localization accuracy: Approaching the centimeter level,2014,The German satellites TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X are high resolution imaging SARs with a resolution in the meter and even sub-meter range. The original product specification document stated an absolute geometric pixel localization accuracy in the same order of magnitude i.e. 1 meter. It was shown by several teams that this accuracy requirement is easily met and even surpassed [1] by the operational products. During the last years the remaining residual error sources could be further studied and attributed mainly to tropospheric delay variations [2] geodynamic effects such as solid earth tides [3] and plate tectonics to refraction in the ionosphere and to technical limitations in the satellite [4]. Our team investigated all these contributions developed correction and calibration methods and validated them in experiments with corner reflectors at different locations. Furthermore we explore novel applications of this high geolocation accuracy that range from classical earth surface displacement measurements to the localization of scatterers in 3D space with a precision comparable to GNSS. This paper provides a summary of latest measurement results of our globally distributed corner reflectors which show consistently a high accuracy better than 2 cm in range and azimuth. Furthermore we report on new developments concerning tropospheric correction using ECMWF and numerical weather models (WRF). Using the best available compensation techniques we can demonstrate accurate 3D localization of corner reflectors and of other objects. Current investigations aim to further improve the orbital accuracy to sub-centimeter level by improved modelling of air-drag and solar radiation pressure on the spacecraft.
1208348,21349,11104,Development of new multi-band equatorially orbiting POLinSAR satellite sensors system configurations for varying latitudinal coverage within the tropical belt,2015,"With the relentless increase in population density, the anthropogenic expansion into natural terrestrial hazard zones has become irreversible resulting in ever more catastrophic disasters within the entire tropical belt engulfing Mother Earth. Thus not only the Indonesian-Pacific Islands, so also South America, Africa and back via the Indian Ocean Islands to Asia-Pacific, these natural events like volcano eruptions, earthquakes with emerging tsunami, cyclones and severe down pours have caused havoc, loss of lives, destruction of infrastructure and above all intentional manmade interference resulting in the deterioration of pristine tropical jungle forests. What is required is around-the-clock local and wide-area surveillance and remote sensing of the vegetative cover for which first well designed optical equatorially orbiting satellite sensors had been developed but their successful implementation failed because of the ever increasing cloud, precipitation, humidity and aerosol cover within the entire equatorial belt of +/− 12∗ per one-day revisitation, within Tropics-belt of ∼ +/− 23.7∗ latitude rendering penetration at optical wavelength mostly ineffective. Hence, we must take recourse to microwave sensing, and implement radar and synthetic aperture sensors from air and space operational at day & night independent of weather; and the sensors especially suited are the fully polarimetric POL-SAR sensors developed for satellite remote sensing by the major SAR technology development centers worldwide."

The JPSS and the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP) satellites are sun-synchronous polar orbiters with a period of approximately once every 100 minutes. The NPP satellite launched on October 28, 2011, and the scheduled launch dates for the JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 satellites are 2016 and 2022 respectively. Together with the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS), the system provides global measurements of environmental conditions by collecting, disseminating, and processing data about the Earth's weather, atmosphere, oceans, land, and near-space environment with precision and detail never before achieved by operational weather satellites. This volume of data allows scientists and forecasters to monitor and predict weather patterns with greater speed and accuracy. Official NPP data products are delivered as Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) files. The HDF5 is a general-purpose file format and library designed and developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). The HDF5 was developed to permit flexible, portable, and efficient storage and retrieval of scientific datasets. The NPP uses the HDF5 structure to implement a data model specifically for NPP data products without use of any required extensions to the native library. Some advantages of using the HDF5 include efficient storage and input/output (I/O), including parallel I/O, and the fact that free, open source software are available for use with HDF5 data on multiple platforms [1]. This paper will discuss the HDF5 methodology employed by the NPP to address the problem of efficiently storing the vast quantity of data produced by the system."
2262622,21349,11104,Analysis of the global vegetation dynamic metrics using MODIS Vegetation Index and land cover products,2004,"Climate change has important implications on the global distribution and dynamics of vegetation that, in turn, impacts the global carbon cycle. Irrespective of the forcings driving these changes, a characterization of global vegetation dynamics and the establishment of accurate metrics that can be linked to forcings are paramount to addressing questions related to climate change and its bearings on the terrestrial biosphere. Terrestrial ecosystems affect the climate through a complex system of interactions among water, carbon and energy. An increase, or decrease in these fluxes forces new equilibrium states and feedbacks to the climate system, which in turn impacts the ecosystems. NDVI-based time series analysis of satellite imagery from the NOAA-AVHRR sensor, collected during the last two decades narrates an enhanced vegetation activity over key areas of the Earth (high and mid latitudes). Most of this increase in activities has been indirectly linked to an increase in the Earth's temperature and CO2 concentration. In this study, we assessed the relationships between vegetation dynamic metrics and climate-ecosystem parameters. We analyzed 3 years of MODIS Vegetation Index (VI) data augmented by a global land cover map derived from the same sensor, and the GTOPO DEM data. Using a stratified spatial analysis, we assessed the role of the following characteristics on vegetation: 1) Latitude: to isolate temperature regimes and seasonality, 2) Elevation: to isolate land cover and precipitation distribution, 3) Land cover: to isolate phenological characteristics. A combinatorial analysis using the above stratification was applied in successive orders to generate compound results. The results yielded coherent time series profiles depicting vegetation dynamics as it relates to elevation, latitude and land cover"
2904591,21349,11104,Estimation of vertical accuracy of Digital Elevation Models over complex terrains of Indian subcontinent,2016,"Complex terrains (mountains) of varying elevations cover approximately 25% of the total global land area wherein nearly 26% of the world's population resides. Complex terrains offer difficulty in accurate owing to their inaccessibility and location constraint to carry out ground based survey. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) offers a reliable alternative to study the orography from remote sensing measurements. Mountainous surfaces and dense vegetation covers offer large DEM errors as compared to flat terrains owing to the terrain characteristics. The reliability of DEMs for watershed modeling is often hinged on their vertical accuracies. In the present study, the vertical accuracies of three DEM from three sources namely, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) and CARTOSAT are examined over the complex terrains of the Indian subcontinent. The spatial variability using geostatistics is assessed over 440 triangulated benchmark stations procured from the Survey of India Department toposheets. It is observed that the RMS error for SRTM DEM is less as compared to the other sources. The value of mean error increases continuously with the rise in the elevation showing the effect of terrain morphology on the accuracy of the DEM. The mean error for ASTER, SRTM and Cartosat is 42.75 m, 36.84 m and 37 m respectively. SRTM DEM shows better results for the morphometric analysis by generating large drainage networks over Upper Bhima Basin. For the future these results can be highly useful in various hydrological modeling over the different river basins."
2516452,21349,11104,Improved modeling of background distributions in an end-to-end spectral imaging system model,2004,"Previously, an analytical end-to-end spectral imaging system model has been developed. The model is constructed around the propagation of spectral statistics from the scene, through the sensor, and processing transformations to lead to prediction of a performance metric. In this analytical framework the description of the class statistics has been by their spectral mean vector and spectral covariance matrix (first and second order statistics). This representation is only strictly accurate when the underlying classes are Gaussian in nature. While some background classes fall into this category, many have been observed to be nonGaussian in nature. As a work-around for this limitation, we have often formed subclasses in the background, which when combined form a composite background class that can be multimodal. However, we have observed in estimates of empirical data distributions that unimodal backgrounds often have longer tails than those predicted by the Gaussian distribution. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a family of distributions, known as the elliptically contoured multivariate t-distributions, can provide an accurate depiction of empirically observed backgrounds. These distributions are parameterized by their multivariate mean vector and covariance matrix, but also by a degree of freedom parameter, M. By varying M, excellent fits to empirical distributions have been observed. Another key feature of these distributions is that the number of degrees of freedom has been shown to be invariant to linear transformations. Since the analytical model operates by performing a sequence of linear transformations on the statistics, the input value of M is preserved and can be used at any stage of the model to represent the class statistics. This paper describes an implementation of the elliptically contoured t-distributions to represent background classes in the end-to-end system model. The functional form and examples of the t-distributions are shown. Results are presented comparing predictions of target detection performance using backgrounds modeled by multiclass Gaussian distributions with the new elliptical-t distributions."
2149703,21349,11104,Analysis of densely observed TRMM/PR data during 180-degree yaw maneuver,2007,"The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite performs 180-degree yaw maneuver (yaw-around) when the solar beta angle which is the angle between the satellite orbit plane and the direction to the sun crosses the 0-degree. The yaw- maneuver is completed about 16 minutes (about 7000 km in flight length on the Earth) in the TRMM case. During the yaw-around, the precipitation radar (PR) onboard TRMM continues nominal observation (but data processing is limited to level-1 algorithms). Therefore very dense observation is realized during the yaw- around. Since nearly fixed target (rain echo and surface echo) is observed by different incident angles in a short time, new information can be obtained that cannot be obtained nominal observation. On the incident angle dependency of the sea surface echo, we can avoid the uncertainties comes from the changes in the target. Range profiles of the sea surface echo of different incident angles are compared with the long-term global average data. The same approach can be used to quantitative estimation of bright band structure such as blurring effect of the off-nadir incident angles. A case study on 24 January, 2000, which is the stratiform rainfall case over Borneo Island and the range of the incident angle is about +/- 6 degrees, shows that significant difference cannot be seen among data and that the echo strength of each height concentrate within 3-dB. However, the range profiles of the surface echo underneath the stratiform rainfall show quite different angle bin dependency from the reference echo profiles near the rain area. For convective echoes, the nonuniform beam filling (NUBF) effect can be estimated by the different incident angle data and the data which location is slightly offset from the center. More reliable path integrated attenuation (PIA) can be obtained from different incident angle data and the NUBF can be estimated both by the range profiles of surface echo of off-nadir angle bin data with an approach by Takahashi et al. (2006) and their change with the location within a footprint."
1477886,21349,11104,"FHYL: Field spectral libraries, airborne hyperspectral images and topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data for complex coastal mapping",2013,"Remote sensing of coastal ecosystems provides fundamental information for the effective assessment of valuable natural habitat. A synoptic view of the shallow submerged and emerged coastal landscape can offer the quantitative ability to obtain spatially explicit data over large and complex areas, where the heterogeneity of habitat is mixed by vegetation and sediment/soil interactions at the interface with water and atmosphere. In the present paper, by combining field radiometry with contemporary airborne hyperspectral imagery and topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data, an innovative approach with the application of Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and Multiple Linear Regression models is proposed in order to define shallow coastal seabed, beach and dune habitat at the finest scale. The implemented FHyL (Field spectral libraries, airborne Hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR altimetry) processing chain leads to an innovative mapping results obtained by an integration of multisensory data. Presence and typology of vegetated and unvegetated beach is represented as the abundance of each physical response within the hyperspectral reflectance by building multisensory and multidimensional hyperspectral - LiDAR mixture space. Mineralogical and sedimentological proprieties of the beach sediment was estimated by using field and airborne spectral libraries combined with sediment sampling in a multiple linear regression statistical model. Therefore, FHyL represents the multisensory data fusion process to classify and map vegetation presence and distribution, as well as sediment properties and geomorphology of complex coastal seabed, and beaches dunes systems. The present research is a novel input for multilayered analysis in biophysical studies and its application on multi temporal dataset modeling of coast evolution."
1588444,21349,11104,Nanosatellites for earth environmental monitoring: The MicroMAS project,2012,"The Micro-sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS) is a 3U cubesat (34×10×10 cm, 4.5 kg) hosting a passive microwave spectrometer operating near the 118.75-GHz oxygen absorption line. The focus of the first MicroMAS mission (hereafter, MicroMAS-1) is to observe convective thunderstorms, tropical cyclones, and hurricanes from a near-equatorial orbit at approximately 500-km altitude. A MicroMAS flight unit is currently being developed in anticipation of a 2014 launch. A parabolic reflector is mechanically rotated as the spacecraft orbits the earth, thus directing a cross-track scanned beam with FWHM beamwidth of 2.4-degrees, yielding an approximately 20-km diameter footprint at nadir incidence from a nominal altitude of 500 km. Radiometric calibration is carried out using observations of cold space, the earth's limb, and an internal noise diode that is weakly coupled through the RF front-end electronics. A key technology feature is the development of an ultra-compact intermediate frequency processor module for channelization, detection, and A-to-D conversion. The antenna system and RF front-end electronics are highly integrated and miniaturized. A MicroMAS-2 mission is currently being planned using a multi-band spectrometer operating near 118 and 183 GHz in a sun-synchronous orbit of approximately 800-km altitude. A HyMAS-1 (Hyperspectral Microwave Atmospheric Satellite) mission with approximately 50 channels near 118 and 183 GHz is also being planned. In this paper, the mission concept of operations will be discussed, the radiometer payload will be described, and the spacecraft subsystems (avionics, power, communications, attitude determination and control, and mechanical structures) will be summarized."
2304064,21349,11104,Evaluation of passive satellite remote sensing of cloud liquid water,2009,"We compared one year of AMSR-E Wentz and MODIS cloud liquid water path estimates in warm marine clouds. In broken scenes AMSR-E increasingly overestimated MODIS, and retrievals became uncorrelated as cloud fraction decreased, while in overcast scenes the techniques showed generally better agreement but with a MODIS overestimation. We found microwave and optical retrievals being most consistent in marine Sc clouds with correlations up to 0.95 and typical rms differences of 15 g/m 2 . The overall MODIS high bias in overcast domains could be removed, in a global mean sense, by adiabatic correction; however, large regional differences remained. Most notably, MODIS showed strong overestimations at high latitudes, which we traced to 3D effects in plane-parallel optical retrievals over heterogeneous clouds at low Sun. In the tropics/subtropics, microwave-optical differences also depended on cloud type, with MODIS overestimating in stratiform and underestimating in cumuliform clouds, resulting in large-scale coherent bias patterns where marine Sc transitioned into trade wind Cu. We noted similar geographic variations in Wentz cloud temperature errors and MODIS 1.6–3.7 μm droplet effective radius differences, suggesting that microwave retrieval errors due to cloud absorption uncertainties, and optical retrieval errors due to cloud vertical stratification might have contributed to the observed liquid water path bias patterns. Finally, cloud-rain partitioning was found to introduce a systematic low bias in Wentz retrievals above 180 g/m 2  as the microwave algorithm erroneously assigned an increasing portion of the liquid water content of thicker non-precipitating clouds to rain."
2979158,21349,11104,Soil Moisture data product generated from NASA SMAP observations with NOAA ancillary data,2016,"NASA Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) satellite was launched on January 31 st , 2015 and has been providing level-1B radiometer brightness temperature (L1B-TB) data with an official latency of 12 hours since April 2015. The primary application users of the SMAP radiometer observations include numerical weather prediction operations that require shorter data latency (e.g. less than 6 hours). With slightly simplified algorithms of the L1B-TB data, NASA SMAP project is also providing near real time (NRT) L1B-TB data to NOAA operational users with a latency ranging from 2–6 hours. With this latency NOAA NWP models could use most of those SMAP half-orbit data that arrives within the 6 hour cut-off time limit. Before a radiance data assimilation capability for NOAA NWP models is developed, NOAA NESDIS is retrieving soil moisture from the NRT L1B-TB data through its Soil Moisture Product System (SMOPS) and makes surface soil moisture directly available for assimilation into the NWP models with the shortest possible turn-around time. Unlike using NASA GEOS model surface and soil temperature and multi-year average vegetation index data, SMOPS soil moisture retrieval algorithm uses the surface temperature data from operational Global Forecast System (GFS) and the vegetation index (NDVI) data from the near real time Suomi-NPP VIIRS observations. This paper introduce the structure of SMOPS, the soil moisture retrieval algorithm for SMAP data, and validation of the soil moisture data products against in the situ soil moisture measurements collected from the Soil Climate Analysis Networks of US Department of Agriculture and the Tibetan Soil Moisture Networks of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The soil moisture data retrieved from SMAP NRT TB data through SMOPS are also evaluated against the NASA official SMAP Level 2/3 soil moisture products. Preliminary validation results indicate that the SMAP soil moisture product from the SMAP NRT TB data and NESDIS SMOPS has similar quality to the NASA official products, but has shorter latency which may be critical to NOAA NWP operations."

SCOOP is a distributed program, incorporating heterogeneous data, software and hardware; thus the use of standards to enable interoperability is key to SCOOP's success. Standards activities range from internal coordination among SCOOP partners to participation in national standards efforts. As the lead partner in the SCOOP program for both data management and data translation, the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) is developing a suite of advanced technologies to provide core data and information management services for scientific data, including the SCOOP Catalog and a suite of standards-based web services providing Catalog access. Currently under development is a web service that will export information on SCOOP data collections in a schema compliant with the Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata. SCOOP is also a participant in the OpenlOOS Interoperability Demonstration, which leverages open geospatial consortium (OGQ standards such as the Web map service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) protocols to display near real time coastal observations together with water level, wave, and surge forecasts. SCOOP partners are also active participants in several data and metadata standards efforts, including the national ocean sciences data management and communications metadata studies and the marine metadata interoperability project. Continued close cooperation between the IT and coastal science modeling communities is producing positive results toward a real-time modeling environment that will benefit coastal stakeholders through better predictive capabilities."
2274122,21349,11104,Global analysis of a 2 Year ERS-2 wavemode dataset over the oceans,2007,"Starting in 1991, the ERS-1 and (later) ERS-2 satellites have collected wavemode data over the global oceans whenever no image mode data acquisition was requested. Wave- mode data are full resolution SAR data covering small areas of size 5 km times 10 km every 200 km along the orbits thus forming a dataset giving information from all global oceans daily. In the scope of the WAVEATLAS ESA AO Project, ESA provided two years (Sep. 1998 - Nov. 2000) of raw ERS-2 wave mode data to DLR which were processed into more than one million single look complex images, so-called imagettes, using DLR's BSAR processor. The algorithms CWAVE and LISE were applied to estimate wind and wave parameters such as significant wave height, wind speed and sea surface elevation fields together with several single wave parameters. The paper presents global statistics with emphasis on wave parameters, namely significant wave height, single wave crest height, and wave height. Areal and seasonal distribution of high sea states is discussed and the relevance of the analysis for extreme sea state mapping is pointed out. As far as possible, the results are related to existing theoretical knowledge and compared to observational data (Hogben atlas) as well as model results. The outcome of this processing will be compiled into a new unique atlas on global waves and extreme events. It is planned to extend the atlas back to 1991 when ERS-1 was launched and forward to present times thus covering a more than 15 years period."
2160552,21349,11104,Spaceborne lidar calibration from cirrus and molecular backscatter returns,2001,"In order to make optimal quantitative use of multiwavelength spaceborne lidar data, it is essential that the lidar be well calibrated. Due to system gain/efficiency changes that can be expected to occur during the course of a shuttle or satellite mission, it is essential to employ a calibration approach that can be implemented on-orbit, preferably repeatable at least a few times per orbit. For wavelengths less than about 550 nm, in situ calibration can be accomplished via normalization to high-altitude nearly molecular scattering regions. However, for longer wavelengths beyond about 800 nm, particularly the popular Nd: YAG fundamental wavelength at 1064 nm, the Rayleigh normalization approach becomes questionable due to both an inherently weaker signal and a stronger, variable, and somewhat unknown aerosol scattering contribution. For lidars operating at both longer and shorter wavelengths, a viable approach is to retrieve the longer wavelength calibrations ratioed to the shorter wavelength calibrations via comparisons of spectral backscatter from known/quantifiable scatterers. Cirrus clouds are good for this purpose because they occur at high altitudes with significant frequency and provide strong nearly spectrally flat backscatter. This paper presents both the molecular normalization and cirrus spectral backscatter ratio calibration approaches, including results obtained from case studies of lidar data collected during the LITE shuttle mission. Attention is focused on developing a simple autonomous approach applicable to satellite lidar missions such as Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)."
2177524,21349,11104,A study on cyclone induced productivity in South-Western Bay of Bengal during November-December 2000 using MODIS data products,2004,"The Bay of Bengal is a semi-enclosed tropical ocean basin that is highly influenced by monsoonal winds and receives large volumes of fresh water from both river discharges and rainfall. Tropical cyclones are a major hazard in coastal regions, both in terms of loss of life and economic damage. The extensive coastal belt of India is very vulnerable to these tropical cyclones. Such cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea during the spring (April-May) and fall (October-November). The surface circulation in the Bay of Bengal undergoes seasonal reversal and forced by remote effects from the equatorial Indian Ocean in addition to monsoon winds and fresh water inputs. These circulation features had a strong influence on the primary' productivity of the Bay of Bengal. Coastal upwelling along the southern part of the west coast of India turns the coastal waters into a region of high biological productivity. The open ocean upwelling, wind driven mixing and lateral advection makes the open ocean waters of the central Arabian Sea more productive (Prasanna Kumar et al. 2001). Kumar, P et al., (2002) reviewed the reasons for less production in the Bay of Bengal compared to Arabian Sea and attributed to the presence of strong stratified surface layer, warmer SST and weak winds. The weaker winds over the Bay are unable to erode the strong stratified surface layer, there by restricting the turbulent wind driven vertical mixing. This inhibits the injection of nutrients from below mixed layer to surface layer. The storm surge activity in the Bay of Bengal is one of the mechanism for the nutrient pulsing into the well-lit surface layer, when the observed patches of high chlorophyll and productivity in coastal regions of the Bay do not bear any obvious relation to the upwelling. Also the presence of gyres and physical processes leads to high chlorophyll in the western Bay of Bengal (Gomes et al. 2000)"
573800,21349,11104,On SAR-based statistical ice thickness estimation in the baltic sea,2005,"In the Baltic Sea the annual maximum ice extent varies strongly, from the minimum (12 %) to an almost total ice cover over the Baltic Sea, the average being 40 % during the last 30 years. The occurrence of such large annual ice cover has guided the SAR based sea ice mapping work done at the Finnish Institute of Marine Research (FIMR). During the winters 2003-2005 ice thickness measurement campaigns with a simultaneous acquisition of satellite-borne SAR data have been performed. Using these data sets we can address the problem how well one can estimate ice thickness or some other quantity related to it using solely SAR data. In this paper some estimation results for a 1-dimensional data set are presented. In our other paper [1] an approach to the estimation in the two dimensional setting, a much harder problem, is described. Here we will examine the applicability of two different quantities describing the total sea ice thickness. The quantities are: total ice thickness (T ) and equivalent deformed ice thickness (Tdef ). The proposed methods use either a classification or a regression approach. The surface scattering dominates the backscattering at Cband [2]. The link between the ice thickness and the backscattering strength is surface roughness. Typically the surface of level ice becomes more rough when aging due to weathering. Hence, the radar response is, on average, stronger from older (and thicker) level ice than from newer (and thinner) level ice. A major exception for this correspondence is the fast ice area where the thickest level ice fields occur. For many reasons, e.g. for snow ice, the surface roughness and ice thickness in the fast ice field are so weakly correlated that there does not exist any functional relationship between them. Another major exception is the marginal ice zone. In the sequel we restrict our analysis only to the estimation of ice thickness in drift ice areas, excluding fast ice and marginal ice zones, see [1]. The most drastic changes in the ice thickness are associated with the deformation of ice fields, i.e. the formation of ice ridges or hummocks. Both these deformation types significantly modify the ice surface characteristics. Hence, these deformed areas can be detected by SAR, the detection accuracy being dependent on the resolution of the sensor."

EnMAP is a German imaging spectroscopy satellite mission with the declared goal to investigate the Earth's surface with a so far surpassing quality. The key scientific questions to which EnMAP will contribute are related to climate change impacts, land cover changes and processes, natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, water availability and quality, geohazards and risk management. The satellite operates in a sun synchronous orbit in 650 km height with a local time of the descending node set to 11:00 and an across tilt opportunity to improve the local revisit time. Two pushbroom spectrometers with 242 channels in total cover the spectral range from 420 nm to 2450 nm with a mean resolution of 6.5 nm in the visible and 10 nm in the shortwave-infrared. The ground nadir pixel size is 30 m and 1000 spatial pixels generate a swath with of 30 km. For the CalVal activities, the routine calibration is conducted within the ground segment of DLR, while the independent validation activities are lead by GFZ. Data is operationally processed on-ground to standardized calibrated products and delivered to the international user community [1]. Standardized data products will comprise radiance and reflectance products that make use of calibration information gained pre- and inflight. To ensure high quality standards, additional independent product validation activities are planned."
1448835,21349,11104,A Baseline for the Decadal-Survey PATH Mission,2008,"The Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission is one of 15 Earth space missions that the U.S. National Research Council recently recommended that NASA undertake in the next decade. The PATH mission will place a microwave atmospheric sounder, operating in the same temperature and water vapor bands used by the low-earth-orbiting Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU), into geostationary orbit. The objective is to enable time-continuous observations of severe storms, tropical cyclones and atmospheric processes associated with the hydrologic cycle under all weather conditions. The ultimate goal is to improve models in these areas, provide initial conditions and assimilation data for improved forecasts, and develop long time series to support climate studies. Both NOAA and NASA have long sought to develop such a sensor, but it is only recently that new techniques have emerged that enable such a mission. The Geostationary Synthetic Thinned Aperture Radiometer (GeoSTAR) is a microwave sounder concept based on aperture synthesis that has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A small proof-of-concept prototype was completed in 2006 under the NASA Instrument Incubator Program, and this demonstrator proves that the aperture synthesis method is a feasible approach for attaining the very large aperture required for adequate spatial resolution. The performance of the prototype and projections to a full-scale space version indicate that GeoSTAR, unlike alternative approaches, can meet all measurement requirements. It is therefore now considered the baseline PATH payload and is expected to be implemented by NASA in the next decade."
2498655,21349,11104,Dielectric spectroscopic model for tussock and shrub tundra soils,2007,"In this paper, the measured microwave dielectric data are presented for some soils collected in the tussock and shrub tundra area located on the North Slope, Alaska, near Toolik Lake, at N 68deg 38', W 149deg 35' with an elevation of 730 m. The measured samples represented the organic rich soil picked up from the middle and base of tussock, organic poor soil from the depth of 20 cm in the valley between tussocks, and organic rich soil from the depth of 20 cm in the shrub tundra site. The measurements were carried out in the range of frequencies from 0.5 to 16.0 GHz and temperatures from -30degC to +25degC. On the basis of that data, the spectroscopic model of complex dielectric constant was developed for the moist soils measured, using the methodology of the generalized refractive mixing dielectric model [1]. This model takes into account contributions from the organic/mineral contents of soil, soil ice, free liquid soil water, and bound soil water arising due to interaction of soil water molecules with the surface of organic/mineral and ice particles. The complex dielectric constants for all the types of soil water observed were shown to follow the Debye formulas, with a single relaxation frequency for every distinct type of soil water. The temperature dependences were obtained for the parameters of the generalized refractive mixing dielectric model, including the parameters of soil water Debye relaxation, that is, the low and high frequency limits of dielectric constant and relaxation time, as well as the ohmic conductivity relating to every component of the soil water. The previously unknown physical phenomenon of liquid soil water transformation into a transition type of bound water, instead of ice, was observed in the range of temperatures below -6degC, which appeared to arise in the organic rich soils studied. The results obtained can be considered as a substantial contribution to the soil dielectric database, to be employed in the physically based data processing algorithms for radar and radiometry remote sensing of the northern circumpolar region."
1900055,21349,11104,1.5 microns: the future of unattended aerosol lidar?,2004,"Unattended lidars for clouds and aerosols are currently deployed at tens of locations in the U.S. and in other countries. These lidars operate in the mid-visible region. The micro-pulse lidar known as MPL is a very successful instrument in terms of numbers deployed, and it is also very sophisticated, because its operating wavelength of 523 nm combines two challenges: it is at the peak of the eye's sensitivity, so eye safety can only be achieved with very low pulse energy (on the order of 10 muJ); and it is at the peak of the solar spectrum, so minimizing sky background radiation is a major problem. In order to operate during daytime, micro-pulse lidars must have an extremely narrow field of view (FOV) and a very small optical bandpass. They are consequently not inexpensive, they tend to suffers from mechanical instability, and they are not field serviceable when certain types of failures occur. In order to establish the optimum wavelength region for an unattended aerosol lidar, the spectral dependencies of eye safety standards, sky radiance, laser availability, detector performance, atmospheric optical properties, and optical materials are presented. In particular, eye safety standards allow a fluence of 1 J/cm 2  at 1.5 micron, which is 10 7  times the fluence allowed in the mid-visible. Pulse energies on the order of 10 mJ are sufficient to make daytime operation easy and low-cost. A conventional bistatic lidar configuration can then be used with a field of view on the order of milliradians, which eliminates the problem of mechanical instability, and the optical bandpass can be limited with an inexpensive interference filter. In addition, the InGaAs detectors used at 1.5 microns are much less susceptible to optical damage than the Geiger-mode Silicon APDs used in visible-light lidars"
1849545,21349,11104,Morphology and chemical composition of airborne Saharan dust during the AEROsol and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE),2011,"The morphology and chemical composition of aerosols associated with Saharan dust outbreaks between July 2006 and 2009 off-shore of the African continent above the tropical North Atlantic Ocean is investigated. Conducted aboard the NOAA research ship Ronald H. Brown (RHB). The trans-Atlantic AEROsol and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE) are a series of intensive atmospheric field campaigns designed to investigate the surface chemistry and provide a unique data set to characterize the impact and microphysical evolution of Saharan dust during mobilization as a signature to different source regions. Elemental composition results for the 2006 AEROSE samples based on energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis system indicate a well-mixed dust-urban plume regime and reveal the presence of Al, C, Ca, Cd, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, O, Pb, S, and Si; while the 2009 samples being predominantly dust aerosols were dominated by crustal elements such as Al, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, O, P, S, Si, Sn, Ti, and Zn. The secondary electron images for both years reveal a variety of morphologies, but were dominated by chain-like association of spherules and non-spherical particles. Raman Microscopy affords an interpretation of the surface chemical processing and mixing state and revealed the presence of significant hydrocarbons in 2006, and sulfate for both years. Back trajectories show an outflow of air masses from Mauritania, Senegal, and a weak outflow from Algeria-Mali border for 2006 and Libya for 2009."
1715775,21349,11104,Ground moving target indication in a SAR image based on background cognition,2013,"Ground moving target indication (GMTI) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a very hot research topic in recent years. The traditional methods are based on multi-antennae technology, such as displaced-phase-center-antenna [1], along-track interferometry [2], and space time adaptive processing [3], and many space-borne or air-borne radars have been developed and put in use. However, the multi-antennae based technology is very complex and costs so much. Many researchers try to perform the tasks by using a single-antenna SAR. For example, J. R. Fienup detects the moving target by using autofocus technology based on shear averaging method [4], J. Dias et al. use the antenna radiation pattern information to indicate the moving targets and estimate their velocities [5], and G. Lv et al. detects and estimates the azimuth velocity component based on the symmetric defocusing method [6]. They can give fairly effective results. However, the mentioned methods exploit the phase difference between the background and moving targets, and the effectiveness will be influenced by clutters and interference. A new GMTI scheme used to detect moving targets with range velocity components is proposed in this paper based on background cognition. The scheme consists of four parts: a normalized background Doppler spectrum set (BDSS), a correlator used to extract the background of a given azimuth vector in a SAR imagery, a normalized moving targets' Doppler spectrum set (MTDSS), and a classifier used to optimally classify the moving targets according to the waveform design algorithms [7]. The output of the classifier are feed back to the correlator to estimate the background further. As a result, the classifier gives more accurate estimations of moving targets. It is a closed-loop procedure. The scheme works well in our recent experiments."
2513643,21349,11104,Monitoring Snow Characteristics With Ground-Based Multifrequency Microwave Radiometry,2009,"Long-term microwave and infrared radiometric measurements of snowpack were carried out with ground-based sensors in winter 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, together with conventional measurements of snow-cover profiles. The first experiment focused on the behavior of snow emission during the destructive and constructive metamorphisms. The second involved a correlation analysis of the small fluctuations related to diurnal solar cycle in order to obtain the time delay of microwave brightness temperatures Tb with respect to the snow surface temperature. From this analysis, it was possible to estimate an effective (weighed average) temperature and the thickness of the layer that mostly contributed to microwave emission at 19 and 37 GHz. The ratio of the brightness temperature to the effective temperature can be assumed to be an equivalent emissivity of the snowpack. Data collected in both years have been compared with simulations carried out using the advanced Institute of Applied Physics (IFAC) Radiative Advanced Dry Snow Emission (IRIDE) model driven by data collected on ground. The model is based on the advanced integral equation method to represent soil, coupled to a layer of dry snow whose electromagnetic properties are described by the dense medium radiative transfer theory with quasi-crystalline approximation applied to a medium (air) filled with sticky particles. Simulations performed by using ground data as inputs to the model have been found to be well in agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the comparison of model simulations with experimental data allowed one to understand some peculiar characteristics of microwave emission from the snowpack related to its physical conditions."

Older GOES-7 data are also available. Created as a testbed data system for NASA's future Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), this testbed provides an opportunity to test both the technical requirements of an online data system and the different ways in which the general user community would employ such a system. Initiated in December 1991, the basic data system experienced five major evolutionary changes in response to user requests and requirements. Features added with these changes were the addition of online browse, user subsetting, dynamic image processing/navigation, a stand-alone data storage system, and movement from an X-windows graphical user interface (GUI) to a World Wide Web (WWW) interface. Over its lifetime, the system has had as many as 2500 registered users. The system on the WWW has had over 2500 hits since October 1995. Many of these hits are by casual users that only take the GIF images directly from the interface screens and do not specifically order digital data. Still, there is a consistent stream of users ordering the navigated image data and related products (maps and so forth). The authors have recently added a real-time, seven-day, northwestern United States normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composite that has generated considerable interest."
2093897,21349,11104,Retrieval of 3-D Water Vapor Field Using a Network of Scanning Compact Microwave Radiometers,2008,"Quantitative precipitation forecasting is currently limited by the paucity of observations of thermodynamic variables in the troposphere, including water vapor. Specifically, measurements of 3-D water vapor fields are needed at sub-meso-gamma scales in pre- storm conditions. This can be achieved using a network of remote sensors to retrieve the water vapor field with high spatial and temporal resolution. Such measurements may be used for assimilation into and validation of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Conventional measurements of water vapor density profiles are obtained using in-situ probes on-board weather balloons, including radiosondes. Remote sensing techniques to retrieve moisture profiles include ground-based networks receiving Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, including GPS, and GPS receivers aboard the COSMIC satellite constellation for atmospheric occultation. These methods provide measurements with high vertical resolution but with coarse horizontal resolution. Differential Absorption Lidars (DIAL) can retrieve water vapor with comparable resolution to that of radiosonde observations. However, these lidars are expensive, and their operation is limited to clear-sky conditions due to the high opacity of clouds at optical wavelengths. Inversion of brightness temperatures measured by upward- looking, ground-based microwave radiometers allows the estimation of vertical profiles with high temporal resolution in both clear and cloudy conditions. However, assimilation of retrieved 3-D water vapor fields with improved spatial coverage into NWP models in pre-storm conditions has the potential for substantial impact on numerical weather prediction of convective storm activity. Measurements using a network of multi-frequency microwave radiometers can provide the necessary information to retrieve the 3-D distribution of water vapor in the troposphere."

The report is point-wise sampled, subjectively estimated by field enumerators and lacks spatially distribution information. The applications of remote sensing technologies have been limited to a low-resolution static image posted on the web weekly during the growing season, without enough quantitative information for NASS customers to fully support their decision makings. This study designs a service-oriented architecture by leveraging open geospatial standards and specifications, especially those on Sensor Web technology. The new monitoring system aims at overcoming the shortcomings of existing crop progress systems/procedures by utilizing NASA satellite-based vegetation index, leaf area index, land surface temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, and model-based longterm weather forecast and by integrating these products with USDA's crop area and other data. Advanced workflow for composing Web services was used in automatically producing and disseminating an objective and quantitative national crop progress map and associated decision support data at high-spatial resolution, as well as summary reports. Standard-compliance enables the reusability and multiple-purpose of functionalities provided by individual geospatial Web services and their composed workflows."
2668266,21349,11104,Cost-effectiveness of Vegetation Biophysical Parameters Retrieval from Remote Sensing Data,2006,"In the context of vegetation studies Earth Observation (E.O.) data have been extensively used to retrieve biophysical parameters of land surface. In some cases, thanks to the availability of near-real-time data, tools and applications have been developed and implemented in the fields of precision agriculture, water resources monitoring and management. So far, empirical approaches based on vegetation indices (Vis) have been successfully applied. They may provide a satisfactory level of accuracy in the estimation of important vegetation biophysical parameters (e.g. LAI, fractional ground cover, biomass, etc). Such methods, however, require a reliable reference data-set to calibrate empirical formulas on different vegetation types; furthermore, they are generally based on a few spectral bands, with a consistent under-exploitation of the full spectral range available in new generation sensors. Alternative approaches based on inversion of radiative transfer models of vegetation represent a challenging opportunity for the estimation of vegetation parameters from data with high dimensionality. This work evaluates the effectiveness, in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, for retrieving the Leaf Area Index, on one hand, by means of empirical relationships, such as the simple CLAIR model proposed by Clevers (1989) and based on the Weighted Differences Vegetation Index (WDVI), and, on the other hand, by means of mathematical inversion of the combined radiative transfer model PROSPECT and SAILH (PSH). Both approaches, i.e. empirical relationship LAI (WDVI) and radiative transfer model inversion, have been tested by using super- spectral and multi-angular data in the solar domain from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the PROBA experimental satellite."
1870564,21349,11104,Radiometric Calibration of Reflective Bands of Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper using Pseudo-Invariant Site Technique,2008,"Historically, for purposes of calibration, the Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor has relied upon prelaunch calibration data, internal calibration data and very limited post-launch data. Landsat 4 additionally has used Landsat 5 TM cross-calibration data. The availability of one more independent source, commonly called pseudo-invariant sites, can be used to improve the calibration of the sensor. Pseudo-invariant sites are mainly well characterized desert sites exhibiting the properties of high reflectance, high spatial and spectral uniformity, temporal stability and are nearly Lambertian to decrease BRDF and shadow effects. The successful update of the calibration of the Landsat 5 TM sensor using the pseudo-invariant site approach suggested using this approach to calibrate the Landsat 4 TM sensor. The pseudo-invariant sites selected to characterize the Landsat 4 TM sensor are Middle East sites at Path 166, Row 39 and Path 166, Row 40. Previously, calibration attempts have been primarily based only on the internal calibrator (IC) and prelaunch data. The Landsat 5 internal calibrator was found to be unreliable approximately three years after launch. The Landsat 4 IC data also become questionable especially knowing that the internal calibrators for both the instruments were essentially identical. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the system with another independent and reliable source-in this case pseudo-invariant sites. Unfortunately, due to the unavailability of an adequate number of scenes at the site used for Landsat 5, the Middle East site of Path 166, Row 39 and Path 166, Row 40 were selected. A large drawback of these sites is that they are the locations of the First Gulf War in 1991. This negates the assumption that the surface and atmosphere did not change during the study period. To account for the change, radiometric correction was done using the known Landsat 5 gain signature. A correction factor, which is the ratio of the averages of Landsat 5 pre-gulf war and post-gulf war data sets (at-sensor radiance), was used to scale the post-gulf war gain of Landsat 4. Both the IC data and pseudo-invariant site data suggested quadratic models for bands 1-4 and linear models for bands 5 and 7. The proposed models provide consistent calibration knowledge of Landsat 4 TM sensor with differences less than 6% in band 1, nearly 2% in bands 2, 3 and 4 and within 4% in bands 5 and 7, respectively."
2979421,21349,11104,Remote sensing products validation activity and observation network in China,2016,"Well design and coordinated implementation of validation activity is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of remote sensing product. However, validation is not a straightforward task and remain many challenges. A generally recognized difficult issue is the inconsistence between sparse observations and remote sensing pixels, strong spatial and temporal variations of surface variables, and the intrinsic heterogeneity of land surfaces. Thus, to develop, design and conduct reasonable validation schemes and activities to acquire ground truth at pixel scale over heterogeneous land surfaces is urgently needed. This contains, from the perspective of measurement, integrating various ground observations collected at multi-scale, in order to validate different types of RSPs from site to network, especially for those land surface variables with strong spatial-temporal variations. To this end, a dedicated validation initiative has been launched in China since 2011. The main scientific objectives and research contents are to develop mathematical approaches for spatial sampling optimization to acquire the ground truth at pixel scale over heterogeneous land surfaces, to form a series of recognized and practicable technical specifications to guide validation of various RSPs, and to establish a prototype of national validation network for long term operation. Specific validation activities, such as HiWATER, were conducted from site to network, through multi-scale observations collected from multi-platform and multi-source sensors, to experimentally examine those proposed methodologies and guidelines. Following the experience of these validation exercises, we are coordinating a Chinese validation network to use standardized and recognized technical specifications in implementing future validation attempts, aiming to extend validation exercises from point scale to regional scale and to national scale across different zones."
2336424,21349,11104,Robust measurement of glacier surface motion from multiscale speckle tracking using local constraints,2007,"A grown importance in long-term operational glacier monitoring has emerged, mainly due to the connection of glacier recession to climate changes. Up to now, mainly two types of methods have been used for the estimation of glacier flow velocities: Image matching and differential interferometry (DInSAR). Although the principal potential of DInSAR for glacier velocity estimation has been shown in several case studies, its successful application is often limited by phase noise, described by the coherence. Additionally, the glacier velocity is often too large to be analysed by means of DInSAR since this method can be too sensitive to correctly track the large displacements occurring during a typical data acquisition interval of one month. SAR amplitude images are not limited by phase stability problems like in DInSAR and can reliably be acquired on a regular basis. In this work, a novel algorithm for computing the velocity field and motion parameters from a sequence of SAR amplitude images are presented. The algorithm is based on the vector relaxation combined with standardized cross- covariance matrix information and cross-correlation techniques. The cross-correlation is used to indicate the candidate motion vectors for each pixel. After this step, by a relaxation operation local smoothness constraints are introduced into the estimated flow pattern, leading to a more homogeneous velocity estimation. In order to handle fast motion and reduce the mismatches, the mentioned algorithms are applied in different scales and linked using anisotropic diffusion equation in case of multiscale cross-correlation. This significantly improves the reliability of the motion detection in the presence of noise, inherent in case of SAR data."
1958898,21349,11104,"Prototype autonomous mini-buoy for use in a wireless networked, ocean surface sensor array",2007,"We report the design, prototype construction and initial testing of a small minibuoy that is aimed at use in a coordinated, wireless networked array of buoys for near-surface ocean sensing. This vehicle is designed to fill the gap between larger ocean surface vessels and/or moored buoys and subsurface gliders. The size and cost is low enough that these versatile sensor platforms can be deployed easily and in quantity. Since these minibuoys are mobile, they can keep station in currents as large as 25 cm/s or move as an adaptive, coordinated sensor array for high resolution in both time and space. The buoy is about 74 cm (29 in) long, 41 cm (16 in) wide (max) and weighs about 14.5 kg (32 lbs); hence, it can be deployed easily from small craft. Deployment times are about 1 to 2 days or more - longer with solar power. The buoy structure is fiberglass and PVC with two 2 W DC motors. Control is done with GPS and magnetic heading sensors and a PID scheme to maintain course. Communication is via a 900 MHz system with a range of 1 to 2 km and plans for a longer range HF/VHF or satellite system. The initial sensor system is designed for ocean hyperspectral observations as surface truth for airborne system calibration and validation and other ocean color applications. Acoustic, wave, air & water temperature sensors as well as GPS are included. The Mark I prototype has been successfully tested in a pool with manual control."
1968949,21349,11104,Ecosystem parameter mapping in Swiss National Park based on a continuous fields approach,2013,"Adequate assessment and management of landscape patterns and processes need proper representation and quantification of gradients of ecosystem biochemical and structural properties. Discrete land cover mapping approaches represent landscapes as classified entities with “hard” boundaries. On the other hand, continuous field representations of land cover or ecosystem parameters offer the potential to overcome the limitations of classified entities that can often not reproduce the full range and variability of land surface properties. This paper presents a concept to generate continuous fields (CF) maps of ecosystem parameters in an alpine environment. The concept is exemplarily presented on a high mountain ecosystem's total (above ground) water content and is performed in the upper Trupchun valley (Val Trupchun) in the Swiss National Park (SNP). It is applicable to further parameters. Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer (IS) data collected over the SNP in June 2010 and 2011 are used for CF mapping of water content. Abundance maps of predominant land cover classes are derived from linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA). They are then combined with individual thematic water content information of the respective land cover originating from either spectral indices or a physically based approach. The resulting product depicts a spatially continuous representation of total water content. The availability of APEX IS data from two consecutive seasons allows studying differences in ecosystem water content over time. CF maps can be generated for a wide range of ecosystem parameters. If multi-temporally available, such products can be useful for explaining ecological patterns such as animal grazing patterns in SNP."
2299180,21349,11104,The role of spatial interactions for prediction of the spectral structure of the atmospheric phase screen,2007,"The atmospheric phase screen is one of the main error sources that affect the precise phase measurements in many fields of earth remote sensing. The atmospheric effects can be mitigated if a precise knowledge of the power spectral density of the process is available and if same sample observations can be retrieved on a sparse grid. At smaller scales, where interactions are no longer isotropic, the behaviour is not easily predicted by the ultimate dissipative behaviour of turbulence eddies. We start by assuming that the propagation of the electromagnetic wave in the lower atmosphere can be represented by a ray travelling in a layered medium where the refractive index is constant along each layer. In a turbulent atmosphere, the interaction among eddies induces a diffusion process that propagates with different rates in both vertical and horizontal direction with the final effect of ruling the number of effective layers in the atmosphere. In this way, the overall path travelled by the electromagnetic wave is governed by the accumulated number of such effective layers whose interactions play a primary role in our model. A good model for the interactions among different layers is the linear interaction model. The power spectrum of the process can be found by solving a differential equation with given initial conditions. It can be demonstrated that an asymptotic power law decay is found under binomial competitive interactions and that, at a smaller scale, the behaviour observed in the observed data is naturally induced by the interaction process itself. The model predictions have been tested using samples of the atmospheric phase screen extracted from Synthetic Aperture Radar interferograms. To this end, the model parameters have been estimated from the data set and the predicted spectrum has been compared with the measured one."
2344694,21349,11104,The development of a fire vulnerability index for the mediterranean region,2011,"The SIGRI (Sistema Integrato per la Gestione del Rischio Incendi) pilot project, funded by ASI (the Italian Space Agency), aims at developing an Integrated System for the Management of the Wild Fire Events. The system should provide satellite based products capable to help fire contrasting activities during all the phases: prevision, detection, and damage assessment/recovering. In particular, the paper concerns the development of a Fire Risk Index to be produced daily with the objective of showing the total level of risk for the area of interest and the zones of major concern within such area. In the European Community the member countries interested by forest fires are at least six: Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, and Greece. The higher number of wild fires occurs in the western part of Spain and Portugal, in southern Italy and in the Mediterranean islands The idea to develop maps able to show the fire risk is based on the observation that there is a tight relationship between the fire and the characteristics of the fuel (vegetation type, density, humidity content), of the topography (slope, altitude, solar aspect angle) and the meteorological conditions (rainfall, wind direction and speed, air humidity, surface and air temperature). These parameters directly impact the proneness of a given area to the fire ignition and propagation. Since these quantities can be measured, notwithstanding the cause of the fire ignition, mainly due, in Italy, to human actions (more than 90% of the ignitions is intentional or accidental), could be unpredictable the behaviour of the fire can be considered strictly dependent from those and then it can be foreseen when such parameters are known."

Four mission objectives are disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring as represented by forest and cryospheric monitoring, land monitoring, and technology development. PALSAR-2 onboard ALOS-2 will provide 1-3-m high-resolution Spotlight and Strip with multiple polarizations with an imaging swath of 25/50/70 km, ScanSAR with dual polarizations with a 350/490 km swath, a shorter temporal baseline of 14 days and spatial baseline of within 1 km, emergency observation service within a 12-h delay for any global target and especially within a 72-h (74 h in the worst case) delay as synchronized observation with the archives, i.e., same off-nadir and observation mode, and ScanSAR interferometry with more than 90% global beam synchronization. The ALOS-2 science program initiates the calibration, validation, and application research of PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 and Pi-SAR-L2. As application research, disaster mitigation and the urban-area monitoring using the high-resolution data should contribute significantly to safety since disasters have occurred frequently and globally in the recent past. High-resolution and multi-polarimetric SAR with a shorter revisit time ensures quicker detection of land changes. In this paper, we summarize the contents of the ALOS-2 science program and its expected outcomes. Some application examples of disaster mitigation using recent high-resolution SARs, i.e., Pi-SAR-L2 and PALSAR, are also introduced."

Multi-angle images provide the volume scattering information which could improve inversion accuracy. HJ-1 satellites are the sun synchronous recurrent frozen orbit small satellite constellation for environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting and were launched on September 6, 2008, China, with a repetition cycle of two days. Now 6 angle observations have been built up from several days of HJ-1A / B images. Images were first calibrated both geometrically and atmospherically. A simplified Geometric-Optical(SGM) model was used for the parameters estimation. The background estimation was conducted from the LiSparse-RossThin kernel weights and the Walthall empirical model. Then, the three kernel weights of the LiSparse-RossThin model were retrieved for each location. Finally, the shrub cover and radius were retrieved from SGM model. Biomass was estimated from the shrub cover and radius. 21 plots for background estimation and verification were measured during July 2009. The R 2  between simulated cover and measured cover is 0.21, but the RMSE of the model fitting is 0.09. The distribution of the shrub cover estimated from multi-angle HJ images is coincidence with fine resolution Google Earth image. So is the biomass distribution. The weak relationship may be because the higher spatial heterogeneity, the view angles' limitation, and the time variance among images. The multi-angle HJ images are low cost which is useful in far and extended sandland monitoring and evaluation. The results reported here also showed that the development of HJ satellite data for wide range of mapping application."
2325989,21349,11104,A Cloudless land atmosphere radiosounding database for generating land surface temperature retrieval algorithms,2007,"A database of global, cloud-free, atmospheric radiosounding profiles was compiled with the aim of simulating radiometric measurements from satellite-borne sensors in the thermal infrared. The objective of the simulation is to generate split-window (SW) and dual-angle (DA) algorithms for the retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Envisat/advanced along track scanning radiometer (AATSR) data. The database contains 382 radiosonde profiles acquired over land, with nearly-uniform distribution of precipitable water between 0 and 5.5 cm. Radiative transfer calculations were performed with the MODTRAN 4 code. Different viewing angles were considered in the simulation, taking into account the features of each sensor. The viewing capability of AATSR, with near simultaneous observations first at a forward angle (55deg from nadir) and then close to nadir, allows the implementation of DA algorithms. Using the simulation database, SW algorithms adapted for MODIS and AATSR data, and DA algorithms for AATSR data were developed. Both types of algorithms are quadratic in the brightness temperature difference, and depend explicitly on the land surface emissivity. A sensitivity analysis of all algorithms was made to obtain estimation of the algorithm errors. Furthermore the SW and DA algorithms developed from the simulation database were validated with actual ground measurements of LST collected, concurrently to MODIS and AATSR observations, in a site located close to the city of Valencia, Spain, in a large, flat and thermally homogeneous area of rice crops, where field campaigns were held during the summers of 2002-2006. Operational LST algorithms of each sensor were also validated in order to compare with the algorithms generated."
599398,21349,11104,The MOSS VHF/UHF spaceborne SAR system testbed,2005,"Summary form only given. This paper details our recent development of a system prototype for a spaceborne sensor that addresses the current NASA science priority of measuring soil moisture under a substantial vegetation canopy and reaching a useful depth within the uppermost soil layer. The mission is named MOSS, for the Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface. It will enable measurement and derivation of data products not obtained from any other current, planned, or proposed instrument, with a solution that offers high science value through a low-mass and, in the long-term, low-cost approach. The proposed system is a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating at the two low frequencies of 435 MHz (UHF, P-band) and 137 MHz (VHF) to enable sensing through vegetation and down into soil. The future mission scenario is achieved from a Sun synchronous orbit of 1313 km altitude, with a swath width of 430 km, incidence angle ranges of 17-30 degrees, resolution of 1 km, and a 7-day exact repeat consistent with the temporal scale of variations of the subcanopy and subsurface soil moisture. We describe a tower-based test-bed that we have developed to validate the spaceborne measurement concept. The processing software, including polarimetric calibration aspects, is detailed, and example science products are presented. The procedures and algorithms to estimate subsurface moisture are presented in detail, and the use an iterative estimation procedure is explained. The results are validated by comparing against detailed ground truth."
750180,21349,11104,Provision of snow water equivalent from satellite data and the hydrological model PROMET using data assimilation techniques,2007,"Information on snow cover and snow properties is an important factor for hydrology and runoff modelling. Frequent updates of snow cover information can help to improve water balance and discharge calculations. Within the frame of polar view, snow products from multisensoral satellite data are operationally provided to control and update water balance models for large parts of Southern Germany. Optical AVHRR sensors of the NOAA satellite are used for snow mapping and snow line delineation. Although these acquisitions are available several times per day, cloud cover hinders frequent updates of snow cover maps. As an additional remote sensing data source microwave data from ASAR on ENVISAT is used. Since C-band SAR sensors are only sensitive to snow with a high content of liquid water, the application of ASAR is limited to the melting periods. However under these conditions the developed procedure allows not only to delineate the snow cover in a comparable way as from optical data, also the additional information where the snow is melting is provided. In order to demonstrate how the remote sensing products can be used for improved water balance modelling, an application example for the watershed of the Upper Danube will be presented. This testsite is the research area of the integrative research project GLOWA-DANUBE that is conducted by the University of Munich. Model results using the PROMET-model of snow distributions with and without data assimilation of the remote sensing products will be given. Developed data assimilation concepts will be presented. Through data assimilation, the modelled snow cover agrees better with the mapped snow cover information from satellite. The optimised model provides maps of snow water equivalent, that can not directed be assessed by remote sensing. The impact of data assimilation on the modelled runoff will thus further be analysed."
2136166,21349,11104,Global satellite millimeter-wave precipitation retrievals trained with a cloud-resolving numerical weather prediction model,2007,"This paper develops global retrieval algorithms for surface precipitation rate (mm/h), peak vertical wind (m/s), and water-paths (mm) for rainwater, snow, graupel, cloud water, cloud ice, and the sum of rainwater, snow, and graupel, for the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) aboard the NOAA-15, -16, and -17 satellites. These retrieved products are expected to be available to researchers and operational users shortly after each orbit is completed, thus providing up to 4-6 precipitation-rate images each day for nearly every spot on earth with nominal 15-km resolution. The same algorithm could be adapted to similar instruments such as AMSU/MHS on the NOAA-18 satellite and AMSU/HSB aboard the Aqua satellite. The algorithm was trained using a numerical weather prediction model (MM5) for 106 globally distributed storms that predicted brightness temperatures consistent with those observed simultaneously by AMSU. Neural networks were trained to retrieve hydrometeor water-paths and 15-minute average surface precipitation rates for rain and snow at ~15-km resolution for land and sea at all viewing angles. Different estimators were trained for land and sea, where surfaces classed as snow or ice were generally excluded from this study. Surface- sensitive channels were incorporated by using linear combinations (principal components) of their brightness temperatures that were observed to be relatively insensitive to the surface, as determined by visual examination of global images of each brightness-temperature-spectrum principal component. Predicted rms errors for retrieved precipitation rates, hydrometeor water paths, and peak vertical wind were evaluated using independent samples of MM5 truth. AMSU and AMSR-E retrieved precipitation rates were also compared."
1817375,21349,11104,The effect of surface reflectivity on water vapor retrieval using MODIS NIR data,2004,"Different absorption techniques are suitable to retrieve the precipitable water vapor (PWV) from remote-sensing data. Some novel methods such as N/W, CIBR, LIRR etc, were proposed directly from the simplified near infrared (NIR) radiative transfer equations [Kaufman and Gao, 1992]. By using NIR water vapor channel (940 nm) in addition to window channels (865 nm and 1240 nm), two-band method and three-band method were applied to derive PWV using MODIS NIR data [Gao and Kaufman, 1998]. PWV retrieval method, with MODIS NIR band is analyzed using radiative transfer code, MODTRAN. The effect of surface nonlinear reflectivity on PWV retrieval is highlighted. Both two-band ratio method and three-band ratio method are taken into account. In a sensitivity analysis it is shown that the error due to the surface nonlinear reflectivity is very large (from 0.36 g/cm 2  to 2.22 g/cm 2  when PWV is from 0.2 g/cm 2  to 6.2 g/cm 2  ) if the reflectance ratio between water vapor band (940 nm band) and windows band (865 nm band) is not equal to unit. The error is proportional (about 14.7 times) to the transmittance (tau 90   and tau 865 ) ratio between these two bands. With Johns Hopkins University spectral library [2000], the ratio of band reflectance is calculated for hundreds kinds of surface material such as rocks, minerals, soils, vegetation and water. Most of the reflectance ratios have a considerable difference from unit. The absolute value of mean difference ranges from 0.0005 to 0.4351 for two bands method. It is from 0.0002 to 0.3089 for three bands method and smaller than two bands obviously. That indicates three-band method is superior to two-band method. To minimize the bands ratio for three bands method, the original band coefficients (0.2 and 0.8) estimated from the band position (940 nm, 865 nm and 1240 nm) are recalculated from the spectral library using least square method. The result shows that C 1  = 0.8477, C 2  = 1, C 1  = 0.1523 and these coefficients must be obtained from the regression of whole spectral library and the sum of these two coefficients must be equal to unit"
866729,21349,11104,An extension of the integral equation model IEM2M for rough surfaces of complex permittivity,2012,"The integral equation model (IEM) developed by A.K. Fung and co-workers has arguably been the most cited and implemented rough surface scattering model in the field of radar remote sensing. It was obtained as a second-order iteration of the incident electromagnetic field to the integral equations of the surface fields. Therefore, it is an extension of the first-order Born approximation of the corresponding Neumann series that produce the classical Kirchhoff approximation. The IEM was tuned many times over the last twenty years due to the imperfect introduction and handling of the Weyl representation of the spherical wave in its first version. The work presented here is a development of the contribution made by the same author in 2001 (IEM2M) and reported extensively in [1] (IEM2Mc). It has been the first version of IEM able to blend analytically both the Kirchhoff and the small-perturbation approximations for the bistatic case and dielectric surfaces. IEM2M was celebrated by those who found the original IEM not enough rigorous but also criticized by Fung and his co-workers. In this paper an extension of IEM2M is presented that extends it in two aspects: the inclusion of evanescent waves in the formulation of the model and the extension of the range of applicability of the second-order scattering terms to interfaces with complex permittivity scattering media. These two issues had only been addressed in the IEM version developed by Du. However, Du needed to make a mathematical assumption on the correlation function which was not explained from a physical point of view. In the work proposed here this assumption is not necessary. Although all these issues are dealt with extensively in [1], this paper focuses on the comparison of IEM2M, IEM2Mc, the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the Small Perturbation Method (SPM). account of them. Regarding IEM, Fung's last update on his version of IEM is available in [2]"
2975389,21349,11104,SAR scattering and imaging with focusing by an extended target modeL,2016,"SAR is a complex system that integrates two major parts: data collector and image formatter [1–2]. In the phase of data collection, radar transmits electromagnetic waves toward the target and receives the scattered waves. The transmitted signal can be modulated into certain types, commonly linearly frequency modulated with pulse or continuous waveform. The process involves signal transmission from generator, through various types of guided device, to antenna, by which the signal is radiated into free space, and then undergoes propagation. The measured scattered signal been made in bistatic or monostatic configurations is essentially in time-frequency (delay time - Doppler frequency) domain. The role of image formatter is then to map the time-frequency data into spatial domain where the targets are located. The mapping from the data domain to image domain, and eventually, into target or object domain must minimize both geometric and radiometric distortions. Essentially, two models that define the SAR operational process: physical model and system model. This paper concentrates on the physical process of a SAR system from wave scattering to imaging. System simulation based on the stationary (frequency modulation continuous wave) FMCW is developed and implemented for both point target and extended target. To further validate the simulation and thus our physical understanding of the imaging chain, measurements at aniconic chamber with two mental spheres and two dielectric spheres displaced with varying spacing were conducted. Good agreement between the simulated by extend target model and real measured SAR images is obtained."
1814504,21349,11104,Potential of C-Band Multipolarized and Polarimetric SAR for Soil Drainage Classification and Mapping,2008,"Among the various soil properties, drainage is the most important one for land productivity as well as the environmental management. Classification and mapping of regional and local soil drainage conditions and hydrologic soil groups are often required as input in many hydrological models used for assessing soil degradation processes and soil vulnerability to environmental losses under intensive agricultural production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of high resolution SAR remote sensing data for mapping soil drainage. Backscattering coefficients (HH, VH, VV, RR, LL, psi45deg and psi135deg) extracted from CV-580 SAR were analyzed as function of drainage classes according to the land use (bare soil, annual crops). The multipolarization data showed a maximum of difference of 2 dB between drainage classes. Discriminant analysis performed after applying principal component analysis (PCA) showed overall classification accuracy of 60% for drainage classes. Only the poorly drained class was clearly discriminated (73-97%) under agricultural fields. Introducing the polarimetric parameters (mean alpha_ angle, entropy (H), and anisotropy (A)) in the general disciminant classification, the soil drainage classification accuracy was improved particularly by the anisotropy parameter. The study demonstrated the potential of C-band multipolarized and polarimetric SAR for soil drainage classification and mapping. However, the high spatial resolution of the CV-580 showed high variability of scattering mechanisms associated to the fall acquisition period, where many crop fields were harvested but some corn fields being not. Spring acquisition near seeding of RADARSAT-2 (launched on December 14, 2007) imagery, should give better classification results."
2168567,21349,11104,Microwave permittivity measurements of two conifers,1998,"Complex permittivity spatial distributions of two conifers, a 5.0-m high Caucasian fir (Abies normanniana) and a 1.9-m high spruce (Picea omorika), have been measured in the frequency range 1-10 GHz. Unlike earlier studies, particular attention was paid to the anisotropy of the dielectric properties. The measurements were performed in the frame of polarimetric scattering, and imaging experiments conducted on both trees in the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL), Space Applications Institute, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. They will be used, together with carefully established architectural models of the trees, to validate forest remote-sensing algorithms. The measurement method was based on an open-ended coaxial probe reflection technique with a rational function approximation model for the probe tip aperture admittance. With this model, no calibration on reference liquids is required and sufficiently accurate results for the dielectric constant and loss factor can be obtained. Results are presented for branches, parts of the trunks, and needles from different tree heights. Values obtained with the probe oriented along different stem directions of the trunk confirm the anisotropic nature of wood. The longitudinal complex permittivity is roughly 1.5-three times higher than the transverse component. Inside the trunk, early and late wood layers and small heterogeneities give rise to fluctuations; the phloem layer and the new needles have the highest complex permittivity. Representative average values for trunks, branches, and needles for modeling purposes are also given."
2949565,21349,11104,Monitoring the atmospheric environment with Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) remote sensing data products,2016,"Today's rapidly increasing environment satellite observations brought unprecedented opportunities for monitoring the earth environments with remote sensing measurement. The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) next generation polar satellite program that provides global environmental remote sensing of weather, climate and other environmental applications. The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite launched in October 2011 was the first satellite designed to bridge into the future JPSS constellation. The data products produced from the S-NPP/JPSS satellites provide critical observations for accurate weather forecasting, reliable severe storm outlooks, and global measurements of atmospheric and oceanic conditions such as sea surface temperatures, ocean color, ozone and other trace gases, aerosol, clouds, temperature and moisture profiles, wind speeds, land surface properties, snow and ice covers, etc. S-NPP/JPSS products provides critical support to NOAA's ecosystems, climate, weather, and water mission goals through numerous operational applications, including weather and climate modeling and prediction, fisheries management; ecosystem monitoring and management; and understanding ocean dynamics and climate variability. This paper will provide insight into the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) data products and their applications for environment monitoring. Specifically, the presentation will be focused on the advanced data products derived from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) measurements, Cal/Val status, products performance, and their applications for monitoring the atmospheric variability."
2054727,21349,11104,Urban Vegetation Estimation Derived from QuickBird Based on Object-oriented Method,2006,"Urban vegetation is considered a crucial factor for realizing environmental quality goals and foreseeing sustainable local development in the framework of Local Agenda21 guiding environmental politics. High-resolution image offer abundance function in improving method of urban environment and guideline of evaluation. The method of Object-oriented classification, considered both spectral characters and structural information, can provide high-resolution images' classification precision and reduce large data redundancy compared with the traditional pixel-based classification methods. In this paper, we use object-oriented method to extract different green space based on various urban environmental land use, such as commonality green, street green and so on.. The QuickBird image is segmented to a set of different scale image, we have make many experiment in order to obtain the optimal segmentation of every level, so the image is segmented by scale 6, and then each object is classified into non-vegetation and 3 kinds of vegetation classes based on the nearest neighbour classifier (NN), Due to the effect of mixed pixels, the second segmentation level scale 5 is carried out into the non-vegetation class and several omitted vegetation objects are derived. Finally, we use a GIS mapping data combined with the results of vegetation classification to separate urban vegetation area into different usages (i.e. commonality green, street green...). Through analyse to the result of classification, the area of the vegetation is 597.63 hm 2 , the urban garden fraction is 25.38%. This method offers a new application approach for classifying the high-resolution remote sensing image and the result of accuracy can reach 98%."
1918021,21349,11104,A novel theory of SAR image restoration and enhancement with ICA,2004,"Active radar sensing is an important method of obtaining inventory information about remote and cloud-covered areas of the world. However, automatic interpretation of SAR images is often difficult due to speckle noise. Appearing as a random granular pattern, speckles seriously degrade the image quality and affect the task of human interpretation and scene analysis. For this kind of speckle removal problem, one of the difficulties is to overcome the tradeoff between noise reduction and preserving significant image details. In this paper, a novel theory of SAR image restoration and enhancement with independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed. We assume that the speckle noise in SAR images comes from a different signal source, which accompanies but is independent (their statistical characteristics are not same.) of the true signal source (image details). Thus the speckle removal problem can also he described as signal source separation problem. Then in order to enhance the true signal source, we classify the basis images and span them into two different signal subspaces, namely true signal subspace and speckle subspace. Finally we build different nonlinear estimators in each signal subspace to recover the original image. In our experiments, the SAR images consist of nine channels of images. We compare our method with two other well known speckle reduction approaches (Kuan filter and Lee filter). The results show that with our method the speckle noise is efficiently removed while at the same time important details (edges in particular) are retained without introducing artificial structures. We further calculate the ratio of standard deviation to mean (SD/Mean) for each image and use it as a criterion for image quality and find that the improvement with our method is more evident for images with ''high level speckle noise"
2913389,21349,11104,Landsat and MODIS Data Fusion products based phenology analysis of dryland in Shan Dong province,2016,"Current remote sensing sensors can only provide data either with high spatial resolution or with high temporal resolutions. It's a challenge to fully characterize the patchy phenology change in the dryland region. The Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) method, can produce synthesized frequent high spatial resolution images through blending Landsat 30 m data with MODIS 500 m data to produce synthetic imagery at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS time steps. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using FSDAF to produce the synthetic imagery over a dryland vegetation study area in Shan Dong province, in order to track the phenological changes. In this study we assembled subsets of six Landsat-5 TM scenes and temporally-coincident MODIS datasets(MOD09Q1) spanning the 2001 January–December including the growing season in Shan Dong, which is noted as a crop producing province in china. In order to investigate the effects of temporal compositing and explore the goodness of the algorithm, we also adopt the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). The STARFM and FSDAF algorithm both were applied to each MODIS data series to produce up to twelve synthetic images corresponding to each Landsat image. The accuracy of the synthetic images were evaluated by comparing the reflectance values with the corresponding pixel values of the reference Landsat image on a band-by-band basis. Our results indicate the effect of the FSDA algorithm in improving spatial and temporal resolution, although the results is slightly better, when compared with the STARFM model. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using FSDAF algorithm to assemble an imagery time series at MODIS temporal resolution and Landsat spatial resolution in crop-populated dryland ecosystems."
2041194,21349,11104,Spectral image utility prediction,2007,"The utility of an image is an attribute that describes the ability of that image to satisfy performance requirements for a particular application task. The robust ability to predict the utility of an image for a given application would facilitate sensor design trade studies, provide a basis for tasking image collection activities, and create the foundation for an image archive indexing scheme. In this paper, we examine methods for predicting the utility of spectral images for detecting sub-pixel targets using the constrained energy minimization matched filter detector. The result of our initial work is a prediction of the likelihood of finding a synthetically implanted target in a target-free image in advance of actually applying the detector. We define image utility for the target detection application as the probability of detection at a specified probability of false alarm. We analytically predict this utility for a given image by first estimating statistical parameters directly from the image, then operating on these parameters with the matched filter detector. Three parametric statistical models are used for characterizing the image background: the global Gaussian, the multiple-class Gaussian, and the elliptically contoured t-distributions. The target models come from a library of target materials and are assumed to be multivariate Gaussian with known mean and covariance. We benchmark prediction performance by comparing predicted detection probabilities to empirical results obtained by applying the detector to the data for two HYDICE images. Our longer term objective is to build on this initial result by developing a more general spectral image quality and utility framework, and specific metrics for the prediction of utility across many potential applications."
1074301,21349,11104,ST Radar system of ARIES for Wind Profiling over Himalayas,2012,"Increasing interest in the Himalayan Environment has resulted, in view of the Global warning scenario including Transboundary flow of aerosols and pollutants and the need for characterizing winds, waves turbulence and Aerosol optical depth, etc. of the neutral atmosphere over the Himalayan region. Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES) located at Nainital(29.24 0 N,79.28 0 E) at an altitude of 6250 m is making Aerosol optical depth measurements using LIDARS and other atmospheric measurements routinely. In order to augment the facilities for measurement of atmospheric dynamics, and to study exchanges between different layers of atmosphere, Stratosphere Troposphere (ST) radar with height coverage of 20 Kms is being established. Based on this initiative the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India is planning for a network of such ST radars, over the subcontinent. This paper describes the design aspects of the active aperture phased array radar designed at 206.5 MHz for measuring three dimensional wind vector over the troposphere and lower stratosphere regions of the tropical atmosphere. As a proof of design one sub array of 49 elements was integrated with the exciter and receiver signal processor and trial runs were made at ECIL Hyderabad. The results obtained shows wind profiles upto 6 to 7 kms, which was as per expectations and thus validated the design approach. Horizontal winds obtained were compared on a day (April 25, 2012), when a GPS sonde of opportunity was launched from Hyderabad."
1973047,21349,11104,"The evolutional analysis of coupling relationship between population and resource-environment in Gansu Province, China",2007,"Gansu province lies in the northwest of China and its eco-environment system is fragile. Due to the rapid growth of population and the remarkable expansion of the economy since the implementation of the economic reforms in 1978, the demands for resources have been increasingly expanding and the eco-environment has been greatly influenced in Gansu. As a result, the human-land contradiction in the region is becoming increasingly conspicuous. Based on panel and serial statistical data, the coupling relationship between population and resource- environment in Gansu province is evaluated through the use of improved analytical hierarchy process and the coordinated development degree (CDD) model for the years from 1990 to 2004. We found several trends. Firstly, the integrated population development capability increased linearly through the whole study periods. The maximum value for the integrated population development index (IPDI) was reached in 2004 (0.875). Secondly, the integrated resource-environment status has generally declined with some annual fluctuations since 1990, while the integrated resource-environment utilization index (IRUI) has decreased from 0.601 to 0.39. Thirdly, the coupling relationship between population and resource-environment varied gradually from minor maladjustment to moderate harmony, and then recently shifted to secondary harmony. The maximum value of CDD (0.753) was reached in 1999. The direct cause of the quantitative variations of coupling relationship is that population system and resource-environment system didn't continuously track each other from 1990 to 2004. Finally, the carrying capacity of the environment is limited, while the demands of human beings are increasing, so programs for sustainable development face huge pressure in Gansu. Given this situation, it is difficult to achieve the goal of an all-round well-off society since per capita GDP in Gansu was only 3,668 yuan in 1999."
2261604,21349,11104,Effective 3D GPR survey and its application to the exploration of old remains,2005,"Since the buried cultural relics are three-dimensional (3D) objects in nature, 3D survey is more preferable in archeological exploration. 3D ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey based on very dense data in principle, however, might need much higher cost and longer time of exploration than other geophysical methods. We developed a small-scale continuous data acquisition system which consists of two sets of GPR antennas and the precise positioning device tracking the moving-path of GPR antenna automatically and continuously. Besides this hardware system, we adopted a concept of data acquisition at arbitrary locations not along the pre-established profile lines, since the high cost of field work may be partly attributed to establishing many profile lines. Using the developed system, we performed 3D GPR survey to investigate the possible historical remains of Baekje Kingdom at Buyeo city, South Korea, prior to the excavation. Owing to the newly devised system, we could obtain 3D GPR data of this survey area having a real extent over about 17,000 m/sup 2/ within only six-hours field work. Although the GPR data were obtained at random locations not along the pre-established profile lines, we could obtain high-resolution 3D images showing many distinctive anomalies, which could be interpreted as old agricultural lands, waterways, and artificial structures or remains. This case history led us to the conclusion that 3D GPR method is very useful not only to examine a small anomalous area but also to investigate the wider region of the archeological interests."
1757486,21349,11104,NPOESS conical microwave imager sounder: RFI issues and progress,2003,"The Integrated Program Office (IPO) of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is currently engaged in developing the next-generation microwave radiometer known as Conical Microwave Imager/Sounder (CMIS). CMIS will replace the current Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and its follow-on, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS). The first CMIS launch is currently scheduled for 2010 and is responsible to produce 22 Environmental Data Products (EDRs). The major design features of CMIS payload have been finalized. The baseline CMIS design has 'window' channels at 6, 10, 18, 37, 89 and 166 GHz and 'sounding' channels at 50-60, 23 and 183 GHz. It employs a dual-reflector system utilizing a 2.2 m offset parabolic reflector for 6.6 to 89 GHz and a similar /spl sim/0.7 /spl times/ 0.5m reflector for channels at 166 and 183 GHz. The two reflectors are oriented at positions 180 degrees about the sensor spin axis. In addition, CMIS will have polarimetric capability at 10, 18 and 37 GHz, and employ a suite of 40 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) channels centered at 60.4347 GHz. CMIS will have a data rate of /spl sim/500 kb/s, mass of /spl sim/379kg and will require /spl sim/350W of power. This paper will discuss the status of the CMIS design and specifically address several options that were considered for mitigation of RF Interference (RFI) at 6 and 10 GHz. Detailed trade analyses were performed to improve the likelihood that CMIS will be able to operate effectively in the C-band region. An end-to-end analysis of the impacts of these CMIS design options on Soil Moisture, Sea Surface Temperature, and other environmental data products was performed. Status of the overall CMIS development will also be provided."
2368044,21349,11104,A neural netwotk based approach for multi-spectral snowfall detection and estimation,2007,"The principal intent of this research is to: (a) investigate the potential of passive microwave data from AMSU in detecting snowfall events and in measuring their intensity, and (b) evaluate the effect of both land cover and atmospheric conditions on the retrieval accuracy. Additional information such as cloud cover and air temperature were added to the process to reduce misidentified snowfall pixels. Two products retrieved from AMSU brightness temperatures were used to estimate surface temperature and to map the snow cover extent. In this project, a neural-network-based model has been developed and has shown a great potential in detecting and estimating the intensity of snowfall events. This algorithm has been applied for different snow storms occurred between 2002 and 2003 in three different locations in the North-East of United States. These locations were selected because of the high amount of snowfall every year. Only pixels with cloud cover and falling within a specific range of temperature are presented to the snowfall detection model. Surface temperature collected from ground station-based observations archived by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) were used for this test. Different heavy storm events and non-snowfall observations that occurred at the same time as AMSU acquisition were selected. Hourly snow accumulation data collected by the NCDC were used as truth data to train and validate the model. To reduce the risk of erroneous identification of snowfall pixels, only storms lasting more than three hours were selected. Such criteria will undoubtedly increase the level of confidence that snowfall coincides with AMSU acquisition time. The neural network based snowfall product was compared with the snowfall detection algorithm over land developed in 2003 by Kongoli et al [1]. The preliminary results indicate that the neural-network-based model provides a significant improvement in snowfall detection accuracy over existing satellite-based methods."
2075389,21349,11104,Measurement and analysis of depolarization generated by scattering over constructive obstacles at 5.8 GHz,2007,"The interest on the scattering due to constructive obstacles appears in different knowledge areas, mainly radar theory and mobile communications. In radar terms, a target can be identified by means of its scattering pattern. Those patterns are also useful in radio communications, in order to obtain confident models for planning the deployment of networks. If co- polar scattering itself gives an important amount of knowledge, the definition of the obstacle is better done when cross-polar data is incorporated. In order to characterize the scattering patterns due to constructive walls, a measurement campaign has been developed, using an automated system, which integrates the mechanical movement to the vector network analyzer control. The aim of the campaign was to check the reflection behavior of different constructive materials. All the experimental work has been performed at the frequency band around 5.8 GHz. Materials considered are a metallic surface, used as a reference, a brick wall, and a chip wood panel. All sample sizes are large enough to ensure that the 3-dB illuminated area, an ellipse with a major axis of 80 cm, falls within the limits of the slabs, thus reducing any diffraction effects on the edges of the samples. As measurements were performed in co-polar and cross-polar polarizations, both co-polar scattering pattern analysis and depolarization index computations could be made. By means of cross-polar measurements, depolarization indexes can be extracted. This magnitude indicates the percentage of the incident wave that is reflected in the orthogonal polarization. The values obtained for the chip wood panel are between 2 and 3%, and those corresponding to the brick wall are clearly polarization-dependent, being 8% for parallel incidence and 0.4% for perpendicular incidence."
368770,21349,11104,A new historic ERS wave mode data set for oceanographic applications,2004,"Since 1991, the ERS satellites have collected high resolution SAR data over the oceans on a global and continuous basis. Operating in wave mode the ERS SAR yields a patchy coverage of the oceans with about 1500 images of 10 by 5 km size each day. These data have recently been shown to be able to deliver wind speed and wave spectra as well as information on individual waves. In the scope of the ESA AO WaveAtlas, the ERS-2 raw data acquired in 1999 and 2000 are reprocessed to single look complex imagettes. This paper describes the necessary steps for the reprocessing of historic wave mode data including an assessment of the effort required to reprocess all available ERS wave mode raw data archived at ESA. Furthermore the paper demonstrates the potential of these data for different oceanographic applications. Special emphasize is put on wind, wave and sea ice measurements. In addition atmospheric features can be analyzed. The data in particular enable the estimation of two-dimensional sea surface elevation fields which are of high practical relevance for ship design or offshore operations. Mean wave parameters like the mean period derived from SAR wave mode data can be used for the assimilation of numerical wave models thus helping to improve wave forecast. Global maps of mean and individual wave parameters are presented. The reprocessing of wave mode data is planned to be extended to the full lifetime of ERS-1 and ERS-2, which is at least 1991-2004. This allows the derivation of wave climatologies on a decadal basis in particular enabling the analysis of climate trends. As wave mode data are also available from the ENVISAT mission a consistent update of these climatologies is possible"
2517331,21349,11104,Improved Image Reconstruction Algorithms for Aperture Synthesis Radiometers,2006,"The European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission aims at producing global and frequent maps of SMOS and will be launched in 2008. SMOS' single payload is a new type of radiometer called Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) operating at L-band in which brightness temperature images are formed by a Fourier synthesis technique. However, in the alias-free field of view where the brightness temperature images are reconstructed, a bias is present which has been found to be higher for high-contrast brightness temperature scenes (coastlines) and lower for homogeneous scenes (all oceans or lands). This scene-dependent bias will ultimately limit the achievable accuracy of the retrieved geophysical parameters, and it is particularly critical for the retrieval of sea surface salinity. This paper presents a general analysis of the origin of this bias, which is found to be actually due to the different measurement errors in the instrument observables (visibility samples). An improvement of the image reconstruction algorithm is then presented to mitigate it. As compared with the previous algorithm versions, the proposed improved reconstruction algorithm further decomposes the visibility samples into some new terms: ocean and land/iced sea, instead of just the Earth's disk over the sky background. This decomposition aims at further reducing the contrast (high-frequency components) in the differential image and, therefore, minimizes the impact of multiplicative errors, improving the radiometric accuracy. In addition, this approach proves to perform the image reconstruction in part of the alias regions and improves the quality of the reconstruction close to the coastlines."
1901978,21349,11104,A South African approach for using remotely sensed data to influence policy decisions,2004,"The government of South Africa has identified areas prioritized for rural development referred to as development nodes. Each node is a focal area identified for the implementation of the Integrated Rural Development falling under the government's Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Program (ISRDP). The concept of nodal development is based on spatial targeting, where resources are directed to selected areas in response to identified development problems and opportunities. A remote sensing approach was adopted to assess the state and condition of natural resources (soil and vegetation) in one Presidential development node. Physical observations and assessment of the natural resource conditions were also undertaken on selected sites. An NDVI time series for a growing season (1 year) was calculated from SPOT VEG, MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR images to assess the vegetation growth pattern within a season and observe the associated changes. A Landsat ETM derived bare soil index was also calculated to classify degraded areas and to differentiate them from vegetated areas. Results demonstrate in the context of South African rural development that remote sensing is an important tool for natural resource management. A growth pattern reflected in the time series analysis provides important information, which reflects variations in the status of vegetation growth. Map showing degraded areas indicate areas of priority for land resource management. Remote sensing provides cost-effective methods for monitoring the conditions of natural resources over extensive areas, in order to inform decision making in resource management processes. Satellite images covers a broader area, which helps in analyses and audit of natural resources in areas identified for development. The outcome of such analyses directly influences the policies for rural development based on the interpretation of the satellite images."
2224450,21349,11104,Multi-Doppler Measurements of Atmospheric Rotors and Turbulent Mountain Waves,2008,"Radar measurements of reflectivity and Doppler velocity for selected cases of rotors and turbulence associated with mountain waves from 2006 T-REX and NASA06 field campaigns are analyzed. The data were collected with the Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR, http ://atmos .uwvo .edu/wcr) on board the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft (UWKA, https://atmos.uwvo.edu/n2uw'). The retrieval of single- Doppler vertical velocity at 30 m resolution above and below the aircraft and two-dimensional (2-D), high-resolution (on the order of 40x40 m ) Dual-Doppler, vertical velocity fields below the aircraft are discussed. The results demonstrate complex dynamics occurring within mountain cap and roll/rotor clouds. Turbulent dynamics and small-scale vortices, without the presence of a larger-scale organized vortex, appear to be more prevalent below mountain wave crests at low levels. The analysis of radar data from consecutive passes during mountain wave events also suggests that while the terrain-induced waves exhibit both stationary and non-stationary behavior, there is a significant evolution in the turbulent dynamics under mountain wave crests and individual features/vortices have a variable life span (on the order of minutes to tens of minutes). The reflectivity fields reveal a disorganized and turbulent structure of the scatterers in the roll clouds. When scatterers are present below the roll cloud (e.g., due to precipitation) their distribution is highly non-uniform. Our radar data does not resolve the 3 rd  dimension (across these flight tracks) and thus some 2-D assumptions are made. The three-dimensionality of the terrain may influence the mountain wave structure and dynamics, but our assumptions are reasonable for flow structures generated by long mountain ranges."
2173914,21349,11104,Monitoring the main crops status of Beijing area with multi-source remotely sensed information,2004,"With the urbanizing development of Beijing, the planting area and spatial distribution structure of Beijing suburb crops are changing constantly. Because the TM (Thematic Mapper) images of Beijing area during 2003 summer suffered from weather conditions, such as cloud or haze, it is difficult to obtain the satisfying classification with only one kind of remote sensing data. To get the first data of the exact area and spatial distribution of Beijing crops, a perfect classification strategy is designed in This work. The images of 2003's TM/ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) in comparative better weather conditions, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) standard products in 2003 and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) at 30 m spatial resolution of Beijing area are adopted. The classification system for main crops in Beijing is constructed which includes winter wheat, maize, soybean, clover, garden, orchard, etc. Based on the phenological features of the main crops, the different crops extracting plan is constructed respectively. The orchard and vegetable in greenhouse planting information are from the supervised classification with maximum likelihood methods. By means of the decision tree classification function of the ENVI (The Environment for Visualizing Images) software, the winter wheat and clover planting information are extracted by the logic operation algorithm among the 4 NDVI data from the TM/ETM+ images adopted in This work while the spring maize and soybean are extracted with the logic algorithm with MODIS NDVI. The results indicated that this classification strategy can not only improve the classification precision, but also decrease the post classification work."
840785,21349,11104,SWIM: A state of the art multi-incidence beams Ku-band waves scatterometer to go beyond current radar systems,2009,"The instrument SWIM (Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring) on the CFOSAT program (Chinese French Oceanographic Satellite) is a state of the art radar for several reasons. At first, SWIM is the first ever space radar concept that is mainly dedicated to the measurement of ocean waves directional spectra ([1–2]) and surface wind velocities through multi-azimuth multi-incidence observations. Orbiting on a 500 km sun-synchronous orbit, its multiple Ku-band (13, 575 GHz) beams illuminating from nadir to 10° incidence and scanning the whole azimuth angles (0–360°) provide with a 180 km wide swath and a quasi global coverage of the world between −80 and 80° ([3]). Secondly, such a wide range of observations requiring high range resolution (about 20 m on the ground) have led to design an instrument whose architecture and technology goes beyond what has been done on altimeter and scatterometer systems. The global coverage and the reduction of telemetry budgets have required to perform onboard range compression. The variety of signals at different incidences, the impact of the complex moving geometry of observation and the required real-time signal processing have led to propose onboard complete digital range compression on backscattered 320 MHz bandwidth signals. Finally, multi-azimuth multi-incidence observations requirements have led to design a complex antenna subsystem that rotates at 6 rounds per minute while transmitting high power RF signals towards tunable directions."
1896978,21349,11104,Analysis of Changes in Vegetation Condition in Grasslands National Park Using Remote Sensing,2006,"This study uses a variety of change detection techniques in order to study changes in vegetation in Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. Techniques such as image differencing and principal component analysis were used to determine what types of changes in vegetation have occurred over the last thirty years. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was also used to highlight changes in vegetation productivity. Grasslands National Park is located in Southern Saskatchewan along the Canadian-US border. The Frenchman River runs through the study area. Three Landsat images were acquired. The spatial extent of the images is from about 47deg 50'N to 49deg50'N and 106deg30'W to 108deg20'W. The three images were first georeferenced to one another, and then clipped to include the area from 49degN to 49deg15'N and from 106deg30'45Wto 106deg45'56W. Change analysis techniques were then performed on the data. These included a Visual Analysis, a Post-Classification Analysis, NDVI Image Differencing and a Principal Component Analysis. Analyses were performed comparing the 1978 and 1987 images, the 1987 and 1999 images and the 1978 and 1999 images in order to get a better understanding of the nature of changes. The analyses showed a decrease in vegetation productivity around the Frenchman River and other small bodies of water from 1978 to 1987 and from 1987 to 1999. There is a lot of change in the agricultural areas. These areas saw both increases and decreases in productivity. It is possible that changes in vegetation productivity around water bodies is related to climate variations and the changes in agricultural areas are related to changes in land use. It will be necessary in a future study to acquire climatological data for the area, as well as information about the conversion from agricultural land to native prairie. It is also necessary to acquire images from other years to better understand the changes."
2300209,21349,11104,Detecting Urban Vegetation Using a Object-oriented Method with QuickBird Imagery,2008,"Monitoring urban vegetation is one of the major environmental applications in remote sensing. This paper presents multi-scale segmentation and object-oriented image analysis approaches to extract urban vegetation information from high spatial resolution images. Multi-scale segmentation is used to segment an image into highly homogeneous image objects in any chosen resolution and generate a hierarchical image object network. Advantages of object-oriented analysis are meaningful statistic and texture calculation, an increased uncorrelated feature space using shape and topological features (neighbor, super-object, etc.), and the close relation between real-world objects and image objects. This paper applies these new techniques to extract urban vegetation information in Lianyungang City with QUICKBIRD images. Four object layers which represent different area of vegetation are built to extract different scales of vegetation. To different applications, the segmentation scale differs in thousands ways, and here four segmentation scales 800, 300, 90 and 20 are selected corresponding to four object layers. Based on multi-scale segmentation, Classification is conducted by fuzzy logic, and membership functions are used to produce class description, which consists of a set of fuzzy expressions from appropriate sample objects. Image objects are classified to proper classes by evaluation of membership function classifiers. Not only spectral information but also spatial, texture, and contextual characteristics of image are considered for classification. The result of vegetation information extraction is promising and the accuracy of classification is higher than other conventional approaches. It is obvious that these new image analysis approaches offer satisfying solutions to extract information quickly and efficiently for high resolution images and can be applied to many other application fields as well."
2882486,21349,11104,Polarimetric features of oyster farm observed by AIRSAR and JERS-1,2006,"The polarimetric features of an oyster farm in a coastal area are analyzed to verify the applicability of radar polarimetry and interferometry. L-band Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) data and Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) data are used to examine the unique structure of an oyster farm located in South Korea. A specific feature of the oyster farm is the presence of numerous arrays of structures of various orientations that consist of exercise-bar-shaped poles protruding above sea level. This paper demonstrates that tide level is strongly correlated with the double-bounce scattering power from the vertical pole structures. This phenomenon is also verified by laboratory measurements using a network analyzer. In the laboratory experiment, double-bounce scattering and total power showed increasing trends with increased height of the vertical poles. Single-bounce scattering is sensitive to the orientation of horizontal poles relative to antenna orientation. HH-polarization is the most effective technique for imaging oyster farms from L-band polarimetric AIRSAR data. The authors were able to use a three-component decomposition of the AIRSAR data to distinguish an exposed tidal flat from a submerged tidal flat. The characteristics of the exposed tidal flat are similar to those of the carbon sponge in the laboratory test, except that the double-bounce scattering power is slightly greater in the real-world example. The single-bounce scattering component in AIRSAR data is generally greater than that in laboratory measurements because of sea-surface conditions and oyster growth. When the horizontal pole was aligned normal to the radar look direction, single-bounce scattering was greater than the double-bounce scattering, even under water-covered conditions. While a difference in tide height of 10 cm contributed approximately 3.0 dB in the laboratory experiment, a difference in tide height of 20 cm contributed to only approximately 1.7 dB in the JERS-1 SAR image intensity. JERS-1 SAR image intensity for areas dominated by double- and single-bounce scattering was 0.78 and 0.56, respectively. Results confirm that polarimetric SAR data are useful in selecting areas dominated by double-bounce scattering in oyster farms."
2409438,21349,11104,Legal protection and data access of remote sensing and GIS database,2007,"Recently, remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) have been variously applied to research and industry in the world. Most of cases, the database of geographic information is a big treasure belonging to a company or a government. However, the digital data set is expensive to generate but easy to copy and propagate. In a private sector, it would be reluctant to invest a great amount of money unless profits can be expected to make. Thus, proper protection is necessary to foster the development of this kind of information industry. This article describes the related laws and regulations of database protection. According to U.S. Supreme court case, Feist Publications vs. Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc., a factual compilation is protected only if there is intellectual creativity either in the selection of the facts contained or in their arrangements as presented so that factual database would be unprotected by copyright. However, remote sensing and GIS data are computerized and digital versions of maps with added information, functionality, and complexity that provide a further opportunity for original expression. Therefore, whether RS and GIS data are supposed to be protected by copyright or not becomes a hot controversy. Fesit case raises a big issue for the copyright protection of database and stimulates a new database law to be brought up, such as the EC Database Directive. The EC Database Directive seems to find a new solution to resolve the problem between the intellectual property right and the access right of database. This article makes a brief introduction of the regulation related to database protection in the United States, European Communities, and Taiwan."
2193210,21349,11104,Radiometric performance of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy system (CERES) instrument sensors aboard EOS Terra and Aqua spacecraft,2008,"Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments were designed to measure the reflected shortwave and emitted longwave radiances of the Earth's radiation budget and to investigate the cloud interactions with global radiances for the long-term monitoring of Earth's climate. The three scanning thermistor bolometer sensors on CERES measure broadband radiances in the shortwave (0.3 to 5.0 micrometer), total (0.3 to >100 micrometer) and in 8 - 12 micrometer water vapor window regions. Four of the CERES instruments (Flight Models1 through 4) fly aboard Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua platforms with two instruments aboard each spacecraft, in 705 KM sun-synchronous orbits of 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM equatorial crossing time. The CERES data products consist of geolocated instantaneous unfiltered radiances through temporally and spatially averaged Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) and Surface fluxes. These CERES data products have achieved a higher level of calibration accuracy and stability than the previous ERBE products. This improvement was attained through the development of a rigorous and comprehensive radiometric validation protocol comprising of studies covering different spatial, spectral and temporal time scales. The in-flight calibration of CERES sensors are carried out using the internal calibration module (ICM) comprising of blackbody sources and tungsten lamp, and a solar diffuser plate known as the Mirror Attenuator Mosaic (MAM). The ICM and MAM calibration results are instrumental in understanding the ground to flight shift and in-flight drifts in CERES sensors' gains."
2287078,21349,11104,An FPGA implementation of parallel ICA for dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral images,2004,"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique that extracts independent source signals by searching for a linear or nonlinear transformation which minimizes the statistical dependence between components. ICA has been used in a variety of signal processing applications including dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. Due to the computation complexities and convergence rates, ICA is very time-consuming for high volume or dimension data set like hyperspectral images. Hardware implementation provides not only an optimal parallelism environment, but also a potential faster and real-time solution. This work synthesizes a parallel ICA (pICA) algorithm on field programmable gate array (FPGA). In the proposed implementation method, the pICA is partitioned into three temporally independent functional modules, and each of which is synthesized individually with several ICA-related reconfigurable components (RCs) that are developed for reuse and retargeting purpose. All modules are then integrated into a design and development environment for performing many subtasks such as FPGA synthesis, optimization, placement and routing. In a case study, we synthesize the pICA algorithm for hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction on the pilchard reconfigurahle computing platform embedded with Xilinx: VIRTEX V1000E. The FPGA executes at the maximum frequency of 20.161 MHz, and the pilchard board transfers data directly with CPU on the 64-bit memory bus at the maximum frequency of 133MHz. The performance comparisons between the proposed and another two ICA-related FPGA implementations show that the proposed FPGA implementation of pICA has potential in performing complicated algorithms on large volume data sets."
1871365,21349,11104,Study of Hurricanes and Typhoons from TRMM Precipitation Radar Observations: Self Organizing Map (SOM) Neural Network,2006,"Precipitation radar (PR) on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite provides high resolution vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) of tropical storms. Three- dimensional downward-looking observations of tropical storms are very useful to study Hurricanes and Typhoons. The increased reflectivity measured in bright band (BB) region can lead to rainfall overestimate. It is also known that VPR of BB holds extensive information on the types of precipitation and their variability. Better knowledge of VPR of storms is important to understand cloud dynamics and microphysical processes, and to improve satellite retrieval algorithm. Because of a large number of VPR observation, it is of interesting to classify the VPR into characteristic profiles so that it can be useful in studying and comparing different vertical reflectivity profiles. In this study, Self Organizing Map (SOM) Neural Network is used as a method to study and classify VPR of Hurricanes and Typhoons. SOM is unsupervised neural network. It forms a non-linear mapping of the data to a two-dimensional map grid that can be used as an exploratory data analysis tool for generating hypotheses on the relationships of VPR. Similarity relationships within the VPR data and its vertical structure can be visualized and interpreted. Preparation of vertical profile of reflectivity used as input vectors of SOM algorithm is one of the most vital steps. In total eleven Hurricanes and forty Typhoons are studied. VPR of Hurricanes and Typhoons are classified into characteristic profiles. The result of classification shows a distribution that indicates location of each characteristic profile within a storm when viewed from the PR. Percentages of contribution of each characteristic profile to Hurricanes and Typhoons can also be determined. By using SOM, VPR can be classified into various numbers of classes up to one hundred. In this study, VPR is classified into four classes. Two simple operations were performed. Firstly, SOM was applied to all VPR data regardless of rain type. Secondly, stratiform and convective portion of VPR was applied to SOM separately. For stratiform portion of Hurricanes and Typhoons, the bright band (BB) properties including the height of BB peak, BB thickness, reflectivity of BB peak and BB sharpness index of Hurricanes and Typhoons are investigated and compared to those of generic oceanic storm. Comparison of those BB properties of Hurricanes, Typhoons and generic oceanic storm reveals similarities and differences among them."
718360,21349,11104,"Automated change detection in satellite images using machine learning algorithms for Delhi, India",2015,"In remote sensing, change detection is used in land use and cover analysis, forest or vegetation assessment and, flood monitoring. Although manual change detection is an option, the time required for it can be prohibitive. It is also highly subjective depending on the expertise of the analyst. Hence, the need for automated methods for such analysis tasks have emerged and thus gives rise to unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of the three types of unsupervised Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for change detection to detect the change in some of the dominant classes in an urban area, such as, vegetation, built-up and water bodies. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI imageries have been selected for a part of New Delhi and its nearby area. In this study, three indices namely Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI 2 ) have been generated from the Landsat data. Three algorithms, namely, K-Means, FCM and EM have been used, since these represent three different concepts in machine learning category i.e. partition based, fuzzy and probability based respectively. The same have been implemented in MATLAB for identifying different type of land cover over a period of 1998–2011. Considering both the intra- and inter-cluster distances, silhouette coefficients have been used for evaluation of cluster quality. The change is quantified in terms of percentage that depends upon the outcome of clustering and the number of pixel grouped in each class i.e. urban, vegetation and water."
2315516,21349,11104,Feature extraction of gable-roofed buildings from multi-aspect high-resolution InSAR data,2007,"The achievable spatial resolution of state-of-the-art synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors enables the analysis of urban areas. The appearance of buildings in magnitude images is governed by effects of the inherent oblique scene illumination, such as layover, radar shadow and salient lines of bright scattering caused by direct reflection or multipath signal propagation. For example, in urban residential districts often salient pairs of parallel lines of bright magnitude are observed at locations of gable-roofed buildings. The first line (closer to sensor) is due to direct reflection of planar roof parts orientated toward the sensor. The second line can be related to signal caused by a dihedral corner reflector between ground and building wall. In this paper an approach is presented aiming at reconstruction of gable-roofed buildings by knowledge based analysis considering the mentioned SAR-specific effects. First, line and edge primitives are segmented and grouped to parallel line pair objects. Then for each of these objects geometrical and radiometrical features are extracted in the InSAR images. Based on the interferometric elevation data in the adjacent area of the primitives the projection from slant range into ground range geometry is done. After geocoding, building hypotheses are built from the fused set of extracted primitives from both aspect directions. The estimation of the building height is carried out by two complementing methods: One is based on the extracted geometric parameters and the other on interferometric height data. The reconstruction results are quantitatively assessed by using a high resolution LIDAR surface model as ground truth data."
1834315,21349,11104,"Relation between satellite-derived vegetation indices, surface temperature, and vegetation water content",2005,"Vegetation is important factor in global climate variability and hence plays a key role in the complex interaction between land surface and atmosphere. In this study, we analyzed vegetation water content (VWC), leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (Ts) from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) and MODIS (Moderate Imaging Sepectrodiometer). For spatial analysis of the relationship between the four variables we selected three regions which have climatically differing characteristics: NAMS (North America Monsoon System) region, SGP (South Great Plains) region, and Little River Watershed in Tifton, GA. Also temporal analyses were performed by comparing of 2003 and 2004. From the introduction of normalized vegetation water content (NVWC) derived from satellite-derived VWC and LAI data, amount of water in individual leaves has been estimated and yielded significant correlation with NDVI and Ts. The analysis of three regions in NVWC and NDVI relationship shows their negative exponential relation, and Ts and NDVI relationship (TvX relationship) is inversely proportional. This correlation between these variables are higher in the more arid areas such as NAMS regions, and becomes less correlated in the more humid and more vegetated regions such as east areas of Georgia. Moreover, land cover map is used to exam how the different vegetation types are related to the land and atmospheric variables, and it is identified that the regional distribution of each vegetation type reflects its biological characteristics related to water and its growing environment."
2429395,21349,11104,Modeling permafrost distribution using remote sensing-derived vegetation data in the source region of the Datong River in the northwestern China,2011,"The source region of the Datong River is an inland watershed and located at the northeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. There is relatively plentiful rainfall in the source region. Vegetation, mainly composed of alpine meadow and alpine swamp meadow, developed well and covered mostly the ground surface of the source region. The equivalent-elevation approach has been proved a valid method to evaluate the double effects of latitude and altitude on permafrost in the Qilianshan Mountains, northwestern China. This method was used in this research. The field investigation indicated that vegetation class was an important local factor determining permafrost development and distribution in the study area. According to the vegetation samplings, the Landsat TM images of the source region were interpreted using the maximum likelihood algorism. Ground surface of the study area were classified into three classes, alpine meadow, alpine swamp meadow and the bare ground. According to the classification, boreholes were also divided into three classes correspondingly. As the small amount of boreholes drilled in the bare ground, permafrost distribution in the vegetated areas was studied. By setting up different datum point suitable for different vegetated covering areas, equivalent-elevations of each borehole were calculated. As far as the ground temperatures of permafrost are concerned, the ground temperatures at 15m depth were usually chosen as the proxy of mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) because of the index has a tiny seasonal variation although the large seasonal changes of ambient temperatures. Permafrost models, between permafrost MAGT and the calculated equivalent-elevations, in different vegetated areas were constructed. Using the GIS software combined with the DEM data, permafrost MAGT of the vegetated areas in the source region were computed and mapped. The calculation results indicated that permafrost MAGT varied from −3.1°C to 1.1°C and from −4.6°C to 1.7°C in the alpine swampy meadow and alpine meadow vegetation areas, respectively. The vegetated areas had a variation of permafrost MAGT from −4.6°C to 1.7°C. In the vegetated areas, the areal percentages of permafrost and the seasonally frozen ground were 94% and 6%."
2157394,21349,11104,Online Geo-referencing of satellite imagery using GIS Web services,2004,"Internet has been employed as an efficient avenue for the dissemination of a variety of geospatial information. However, the distribution of the geospatial processing capabilities over the Internet, especially those related to geospatial image processing, is still lacking. Many customized solutions based on CORBA (Component Object Request Broker Architecture) and DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) have been developed to deliver geoprocessing functionality online but they are often designed to operate on specific datasets and they cannot interact with other online data sources easily. Geoprocessing is usually achieved through a series of steps. The inability of these solutions to support generic online data makes it impossible to chain with other systems to perform sequential processing. The inseparability of data and geoprocessing functionality of these online solutions has limited their usability. To achieve the separation between online data suppliers and geospatial processing functionality, a framework of geoprocessing Web services is proposed in this research. An online image geometric rectification Web service is developed as an example. This Web service allows the images to be rectified and transformed into a known geographic projection (with map coordinates). The reference images or maps with known projection can be obtained from a data supplier Web service. The users of the client application can identify ground control points (GCPs) from both the reference digital map/image and the local input image. The proposed image geometric rectification Web service then performs the actual rectification based on these GCPs and returns to the client application the transformation parameters estimated through a least square solution. Due to the use of industry standard technologies such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI to build geoprocessing Web services, it is possible to distribute the geoprocessing capabilities in a platform and language independent manner over the Internet, with faster client application development, easier service deployment and efficient online discovery"

NPOESS is a joint mission of three federal agencies: NASA, NOAA, and DoD. NASA Science Data Segment's (SDS) primary role in NPP is to independently assess the quality of the NPP science and environmental data records for climate research. Such assessment is critical for making NPOESS products the best that they can be for operational use and ultimately for climate studies. The SDS supports science assessment by assuring the timely provision of NPP data to NASA's science teams organized by climate measurement themes. The SDS breaks down into ten major elements: an input element that receives data from the operational agencies and acts as a buffer, a calibration analysis element, five elements devoted to measurement based quality assessment, one Production Element for Earth Radiation, an element used to test algorithmic improvements, and an element that coordinates overall science direction and results. This paper describes how the NPP SDS leveraged existing systems, the final system architectures, and lessons learned for the development of mission-reliable research-ready systems capable of supporting the assessment of NPP derived products."
2438587,21349,11104,Radar antenna architectures and sampling strategies for space based moving target recognition,2005,"Ground moving target indication (GMTI) by a space based radar system demands special antenna and data acquisition concepts to overcome the problem of discriminating the target signal from the clutter returns, which - because of the high speed of the satellite - comprise a broad mixture of radial velocities within the antenna beam leading to a large Doppler spread. These concepts - realised by different kinds of phase centre diversity - offer the capability for techniques like ATI (along track interferometry), DPCA (displaced phase centre antenna), or STAP (space time adaptive processing). For a space based system, the number of receiver channels connected to subapertures is limited to a few (normally two or three) because of their weight and volume and the high data rates. The classical ATI architecture with the antenna split into two halves admits only suboptimum GMTI performance. Nevertheless, since phased array antennas offer the possibility to switch the phases and amplitudes of the T/R modules from pulse to pulse, more degrees of freedom can be introduced increasing the perfor- mance considerably. As a low-priced alternative to phased array systems, analogue multi-port antennas, e.g. multi-feed reflector antennas, can be used to generate multi-dimensional data bearing information on radial motion of targets. In this paper different concepts of spatial-temporal diversity are discussed and analysed for realistic system parameters with respect to ambiguities and detection performance for moving targets."
1835366,21349,11104,Remote Sensing Analysis of Recent Active Tectonics in Pamir Using Digital Elevation Model: River Profile Approach,2008,"Digital elevation models (DEMs) are key component for computer-based analyses of river profiles, drainage basin as it provides elevation information for the land surface throughout the catchment of the area. During the Cenozoic uplift of Tibetan plateau and surrounding ranges due to India-Eurasia collision, the tectonic processes are interacting with the local random effects (e.g. Landslides, Glaciations and climatic Changes) and are linked with the development of a unique river network in this region. These rivers have distinct patterns and are controlled by different tectonic and climatic regions. Drainage history of the Pamir is related to continental movements of the plates, displacements of the tectonics, regional uplift and erosion of various individual tectonic units. This study focuses on the application of remote sensing techniques in order to show the spatial variation of uplift and deformation along the right bank tributaries of Pyanj (Vanch, Yazgulem, Aksu-Murghab-Bartang, Gunt-Alichur and Shokhdara) and one of the few left bank tributary (Shiveh river) and Pyanj itself. DEM data is used to extract river network in this area. Moreover, slopes and drainage areas are also calculated from Digital Elevation Model. Based on the stream power law, we make area-slope plot so as to derive channel parameters like concavity (thetas) and steepness (K s ) which are related closely to uplift and deformation. The lineaments and major tectonic features have been digitized from geological maps of the region. The uplift, steepness and hack index maps have been generated by using some specially designed algorithms for this purpose."
2163741,21349,11104,Matching strategy for co-registration of surfaces acquired by magnetic resonance imaging,2005,"Many photogrammetric and GIS applications work with surfaces that are commonly acquired by different sensors, from different viewpoints, and/or at different times. Manipulation of these data requires them to be relative to the same reference frame, and therefore surface matching is a necessary procedure for these applications. Similar to remote sensing, medical image analyses also deal with surfaces such as in studies of disease progression where changes between anatomical surfaces are detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a medical imaging modality, is used in this research to capture 3D data of knee joint structures to aid in the non-invasive monitoring of joint diseases. However, human subjects can be positioned differently each time, and disease progression might lead to anatomical changes. As a result, surface matching is an essential task for these applications. Due to the similarities between remote sensing and medical image analyses, the major objective of this research is to translate and modify methods originally developed for geographic data to create new techniques that are feasible for accurate co-registration of MR 3D data. The proposed methodology is based on a voting scheme that can simultaneously establish the correspondence between datasets and estimate the transformation parameters. The matching is performed locally, and only matched features will contribute to the determination of the transformation parameters. Preliminary experiments were conducted on bone surfaces, and an average normal distance between surface elements of 0.201 mm was achieved after registration. This is quite good considering the MR image resolution, and it also shows that the proposed matching strategy is feasible and reliable when applied to MR data."
1152773,21349,11104,Validation of AMSR-E Soil Moisture Products Using Watershed Networks,2006,"Validation is a challenging task for passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture from Earth orbit. The key issue is spatial scale; conventional measurements of soil moisture are made at a point, whereas satellite sensors provide an integrated area/volume value for a much larger spatial extent. A robust validation program should include as many types of comparisons as possible and must attempt to provide actual spatially representative ground based soil moisture. A ground based validation program also requires a wide range of conditions, long temporal coverage and continuous observations. As part of the AMSR-E validation activity an augmented network of dedicated validation sites at actively monitored watersheds has been developed. These provide estimates of the average soil moisture over watersheds and surrounding areas that approximate the size of the AMSR-E footprint. This is done on a continuous basis, partially in real time. A public database of the watershed data for all sites is being developed and made available. To implement this network, additional surface soil moisture and temperature sensors (0-5 cm depth) were installed at and around existing instrument locations in four watersheds located in different climate regions of the U.S. Through short term and extended field campaigns the calibration of these instruments has been established. Methods for scaling from the point measurements to the integrated watershed/footprint average have also been developed as part of the validation effort. These efforts will be of value in alternate algorithm comparisons and will benefit future missions including SMOS."
2345661,21349,11104,A Comparison of Airborne Passive Microwave Brightness Temperatures and Snowpack Properties across the Boreal Forests of Finland and Western Canada,2006,"The seasonal snowpack across the boreal forest is an important national resource in both Canada and Finland, contributing freshwater for agriculture, human consumption, and hydropower generation. In both countries, satellite passive microwave data are utilized to provide operational information on snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) throughout the snow cover season. Airborne passive microwave surveys conducted independently across Finland and western Canada during March and April 2005 and March 2006 provided the opportunity to assess the level of similarity in snowpack physical properties and brightness temperature response to snowpack qualities using two independent data sets. The primary objectives of these campaigns were to determine the influence of small-scale heterogeneity on satellite data, using relatively high resolution airborne measurements, and to assess the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model capability of predicting emitted brightness temperatures under varying snowpack and landscape conditions. Comparisons of brightness temperature emissions over different land cover types showed a clear distinction of wetlands and snow-covered ice from forested and open areas. This is reflected also as a strong relationship between 6.9-GHz measurements and fractional lake cover in both Canada and Finland, with relationships at 18 and 37 GHz being less consistent between data sets. Comparisons of experimental data versus HUT snow emission model predictions showed relatively good agreement between the simulations and airborne data, specifically for the Finnish data set."
2023782,21349,11104,Monitoring and statistical analysis of lanslides in Taiwan Island using multi satellite images and GIS Data,2007,"Earthquakes or torrential rains often lead to landslides. The Chichi earthquake in 1999 struck Nantou County of central Taiwan and caused civilian casualties of more than 2,400. The earthquake also turned the disaster areas into the sites of tens of thousands of landslides and rock avalanches. Added with the annual April-June Mei-Yu rain season and July-September typhoon season, Nantou County is further victimized by these elemental factors because it is one of the most affected areas during those seasons. With respect to the worsening scenario, this project attempts an in-depth look at the most damaged regions, using the high resolution SPOT satellite images taken in Septembers of 1999, 2002 and 2005. Landslide prediction is of spatial and temporal concerns, since these targeted sites cannot be thoroughly understood without knowledge of its geological past. This study thus examines the prospective changes in the entire measures of area of landslide sites in Nantou using Markov's statistics model. The purpose is to develop a comprehensive methodology for conducting a random prediction of spatial and environmental factors in response to the transitory processes of the landslide areas. With the application of transition matrices derived from Markov's model in the changes in future landslide coverage, it is estimated that the ratio of landslide will gradually stabilize from 1.02% in 2002 and 0.93% in 2005 to 0.82% in 2032. And from the analysis of Logit model, it is clear that the landslides are closely related to cumulated rainfall, altitude, slope gradients and geological formations, and in particular slope gradients having the greatest effect."
1900168,21349,11104,Toward consistent regional-to-global-scale vegetation characterization using orbital SAR systems,1998,"A study was conducted to assess the potential of combined imagery from the existing European and Japanese orbitar synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, ERS-1 (C-hand, VV-polarization) and JERS-1 (L-band, HH-palarization), for regional-to-global-scale vegetation classification. For seven test sites from various ecoregions in North and South America, ERS-1/JERS-1 composites were generated using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data for terrain correction of geometric and radiometric distortions. An edge-preserving speckle reduction process was applied to reduce the fading variance and prepare the data for an unsupervised clustering of the two-dimensional (2D) SAR feature space. Signature-based classification of the clusters was performed for all test sites with the same set of radar backscatter signatures, which were measured from well-defined polygons throughout all test sites. While trained on one-half of the polygons, the classification result was tested against the other half of the total sample population. The multisite study was followed by a multitemporal study in one test site, clearly showing the necessity of including multitemporal data beyond a level 1 (woody, herbaceous, mixed) vegetation characterization. Finally, classifications with simulation of backscatter variations shows the dependence of the classification results on calibration accuracy and on naturally occurring backscatter changes of natural surfaces. Overall, it is demonstrated that the combination of existing orbital L- and C-band SAR data is quite powerful for structural vegetation characterization."
1353468,21349,11104,Bistatic SAR experiments with the TanDEM-X constellation,2012,"Launched in June 2010, TanDEM-X is an interferometric mission with the main goal of providing a high-resolution, global and unprecedentedly accurate digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth by means of single-pass X-band SAR interferometry. Despite its usual quasi-monostatic configuration, TanDEM-X is the first genuinely bistatic SAR system in space. During its monostatic commissioning phase, the system was operated in pursuit monostatic mode. During that time, some pioneering bistatic SAR experiments with both satellites commanded in non-nominal modes were conducted with the main purpose of testing the performance of both space and ground segments in very demanding scenarios. In particular, this article includes results of the first bistatic acquisition and the first single-pass interferometric (mono/bistatic) acquisition with TanDEM-X, addressing their innovative aspects and focussing on the analysis of the experimental results. Even in the absence of essential synchronisation and calibration information, bistatic images and interferogramswith similar quality to pursuit monostatic have been obtained. Some months later, with TanDEM-X already in its operational DEM-acquisition phase a further challenging bistatic acquisition carried out in cooperation with DLR's airborne radar F-SAR has been carried out. The objective was to acquire fully polarimetric interferometric data with a high range of available bistatic angles. A dedicated commanding of both TanDEM-X and F-SAR was required, including irregular sampling schemes, partially missing bistatic echo reception and bistatic synchronisation, which pose a number of technological challenges in SAR data processing before the calibrated bistatic SAR images are obtained. This article reports about these two set of experiments."
2478222,21349,11104,A derivative spectrum algorithm for determination of chlorophyll-a concentration in the Pearl River estuary,2007,"Chlorophyll-a is the pigment presented in living plants or phytoplankton responsible for the photosynthesis, and it is a very important ecological and environmental parameter of waters, not only used for estimation of ocean primary productivity, but also for detection of red tides and for water quality. The chlorophyll-a concentration in coastal waters is generally overestimated from ocean color satellite data with common algorithm. In order to improve the remotely-sensed estimation of chlorophyll-a, many efforts have been made. In this study, six cruises for in situ data collection were conducted in lower reaches of the Pearl River and its estuary, the Lingdingyang, from 2003 to 2006. And the variables such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, total suspended matters (TSM), nutrients and gelbstoff absorption coefficient (Ag) were collected. The in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were measured from above waters with an ocean optics USB2000 spectrometer, which covers wavelength from 200 to 850 nm with spectral resolution of 0.38 nm. The original in situ Rrs data were processed to EO-1/hyperion bands (at resolution about 10 nm), and the derivative spectra with the different spectral resolutions were analyzed. The statistic analysis shows that the relative coefficient between derivative spectrum and chlorophyll-a is higher than that between original spectrum and chlorophyll-a. The band with highest relative coefficient to chlorophyll-a was employed for development of chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithm. A derivative spectrum algorithm was developed, and then applied to EO-1/hyperion data, which were acquired in December 16, 2006. The distribution image maps of chlorophyll-a concentration retrieved from EO-1/hyperion data were obtained. It shows that the derivative spectral method is an alternative approach for detection of water quality in coastal waters."
2104135,21349,11104,Use of Pseudo-Invariant Sites for Long-Term Sensor Calibration,2008,"Over the past several years, pseudo-invariant sites for trending the radiometric gain of multispectral satellite imaging systems has proven to be very useful and accurate. For example, the lifetime calibration of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) was recently updated based in large part upon this approach. This effort reduced the error in the gain estimate from roughly 13 percent to less than 5 percent and integrated a variety of absolute calibration estimates for the sensor. Typically, pseudo-invariant sites are located in arid regions where very little temporal and spatial change occurs over long periods of time and significant extent. Sites in the Sahara desert are especially attractive. However, drawbacks of this approach are that the sites are relatively unacceptable and, for some instruments, only limited numbers of data sets are available. As a result, it would be helpful to use sites that are observed often, such as locations in North America, so that the technique could be applied to more sensors both historically and in the future. The drawback to these sites is that they are typically of much smaller extent and, therefore, are more difficult to use from a geometric perspective. Recent work has shown that small pseudo-invariant sites, if carefully chosen, can also be used for accurate trending of satellite instruments. This paper will illustrate an approach that suggests the calibration site commonly known as Sonoran Desert can be used to observe the characteristic calibration curve of Landsat 5 TM. Because of the significant number of observations of this site, and other similar sites in North America, there is good potential to extend this technique to additional multispectral instruments for enhanced long term monitoring of radiometric gain."

New in this vision is the desire for symbiotic communication to dynamically guide an Earth observation system. An Earth observation system which is not just a single satellite acting on its own but a constellation of satellites, and sub-orbital platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles, and ground observations interacting with computer systems used for modeling, data analysis and dynamic observation guidance. An autonomous Objectively Optimized Observation Direction System (OOODS) is of great utility for Earth observation. In particular, to have a fleet of smart assets that can be reconfigured based on the changing needs of science and technology. The OOODS integrates a modeling and assimilation system within the sensor web allowing the autonomous scheduling of the chosen assets and the autonomous provision of analyses to users. The OOODS operates on generic principles that could easily be used in configurations other than the specific examples described here. Metrics of what we do not know (state vector uncertainty) are used to define what we need to measure and the required mode, time and location of the observations, i.e. to define in real time the observing system targets. Metrics of how important it is to know this information (information content) are used to assign a priority to each observation. The metrics are passed in real time to the sensor web observation scheduler to implement the observation plan for the next observing cycle. The same system could also be used to reduce the cost and development time in an Observation Sensitivity Simulation Experiment (OSSE) mode for the optimum development of the next generation of space and ground-based observing systems."
1122697,21349,11104,Estimation of Directional Vegetation Fraction Cover from TOA Spectral Data of AATSR,2008,"Among the key parameters acquired by remote sensing inversion, vegetation fraction cover is one of the crucial variables. Component temperatures inversion and leaf area index (LAI) inversion all have close relations with the vegetation fraction cover. The objective of this study is to develop a method to estimate the vegetation cover fraction from satellite observation. Traditional methods of inferring vegetation fraction cover from satellite remote sensing include spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and scaled normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Those methods often rely on a series of steps in the processing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular correction and so on. Generally, those procedures are very computationally demanding. In addition, the errors associated with each procedure may be accumulated and significantly affect to the accuracy of the final products. In this study, a new retrieval methodology is proposed to calculate vegetation fraction cover over mixed pixels directly from the AATSR spectral reflectance data at top-of-atmosphere (TOA). The method consists of extensive radiative transfer simulations under a wide variety of solar illumination and sensor view conditions, atmospheric profiles, aerosol types and conditions and vegetation canopy leaf angle distributions. The derivation of vegetation fraction cover from TOA observations requires several steps of processing.Important steps include, (1) Preparing for the model input variables: foliage and soil spectral data on red, green and near-infrared bands which measured from two kinds of vegetation and three kinds of soil in the field experiment; (2) Generating a database based on a canopy radiative transfer model, Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL), and a hybrid linear model with the spectral data combined with vegetation geometric construction data and observation geometric data; (3)Atmospheric correction that converts surface ensemble reflectance to TOA ensemble reflectance based on a radiative transfer model, Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar (6S); (4) Mapping the relationships between spectral directional ensemble reflectance and vegetation fraction cover through a nonlinear regress method. The correction coefficients of the surface vegetation fraction cover computed with AATSR are provided.vegetation fraction cover retrieval from TOA data of AATSR does not exceed by 6% at nadir view and 9.7% at forward view, respectively. The performances of input parameters on estimates of vegetation fraction cover are given compared with the true surface vegetation fraction cover. The aim of estimating vegetation fraction cover is to prepare for inversing component temperatures using AATSR data, in which process vegetation fraction cover is an important parameter."
1977910,21349,11104,A comparisons of model based and image based surface parameters estimation from polarimetric SAR,2005,"Abstract : Surface can be characterized in terms of its material (dielectric) and geometric properties. The dielectric properties of the surface are expressed primarily by its moisture content, while the roughness describes the geometric characteristics of surface. Various techniques for information retrieval from remotely sensed data have been proposed in a number of recent studies. Some of them are based on an empirical relationship between the measured return signals and the ground truth. Because of their development from a limited number of observations, these models are generally valid only for the conditions under which those measured data were taken. These models also appear that no dependence on the roughness parameter, l-correlation length. In this work, the potential of using the polarimetric SAR data over surface scatterers in order to invert surface parameters is investigated. The model-based and image-based inversion schemes are investigated and compared; the former is doing retrieval from a dynamic learning neural network trained with the Advanced Integral Equation Model, while the latter is schemed from a decomposition of coherency matrix. In model based approach, only the surface scattering term of total return is used in order to remove the vegetation effects. The image based approach accounts for non-zero cross-polarized, backscattering as well as depolarization by three polarimetric parameters, namely the scattering entropy(H), the scattering anisotropy(A), and the alpha angle(alpha). The features of these two schemes are discussed in terms of numerical aspects and physical implications of the surface parameters being inverted by using experimental E-SAR L-band data . We also show the performances of inversion and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of both schemes."
2259283,21349,11104,"L-band active-passive and L-C-X-bands passive data for soil moisture retrieval, two different approaches in comparison",2004,"In the context of the project HYDRO-POL, a study was carried out to test the efficiency of two different approaches: the use of L band active and passive data or the use of L-C-X bands passive data to retrieve soil moisture of bare soils. Simulated data are generated implementing classical superficial scattering models: IEM model for active L-band and L-C-band passive data, GO model for X-band passive data. Data are simulated considering different roughness conditions and moisture content. As the inversion problem is very complex, artificial feedforward backpropagation neural networks (NN) were employed. The best performing NNs are chosen to simulate a retrieval with a dataset artificially added with noise. In each case, the best retrieved parameter is the real part of the dielectric constant, while roughness parameters, especially autocorrelation length, is not very well retrieved. In many cases, retrieved values are out of range, so that the simulated values and targets appear unrelated. Applying a very generic filter that eliminates values very far from the proper range, correlation coefficients grow up. This filter cleans up the resulting data removing a small part of them. After this filtration, correlation coefficients relative to the real part of the dielectric constant surpass 0.82. In spite of the filtering process, roughness parameters retrieval is of inferior quality. On smooth soil, the three considered configurations work in an equivalent way, excellently retrieving the real part of the dielectric constant, without a need for filtration. On medium and rough soil, inversion results generally more difficult, so that performance gets worse. Active-passive approach results more efficient than the L-C-X one"

The objective of this paper is to present a methodology — and the related results — for the generation of land cover maps and changes over large areas by fusing single-date or interferometric ALOS PALSAR Fine/Dual Beam data with multi-temporal ENVISAT ASAR Image Mode/Alternating Polarization intensity. In synthesis, the method is based on data fusion by exclusively considering — in the prior knowledge-based classifier that requires neither user-defined parameters nor reference samples — the data characteristics and related acquisition modes. Results clearly show that the synergetic use enables the reliable identification of key land cover types (in particular cropped areas, bare soil areas, forestry, forest clear cut, forest burnt areas, water bodies) and their evolution over time, providing basic information on the land cover status. Finally, it is shown that using the same 46-days interferometric ALOS PALSAR data set, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with higher quality than the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) one can be generated in those nearly equatorial — non dense forest — regions."
1998231,21349,11104,Retrieval of gelbstoff absorption coefficient in pearl river estuary using remotely-sensed ocean color data,2005,"Gelbstoff is the main absorber in natural waters of UV and visible light, and has an increasing absorption with decreasing wavelength in the range between 700 and 350 nm. Gelbstoff is often an important source of interference in the determination of plant pigments (e.g., Chlorophyll a) in coastal waters using remotely- sensed ocean color data. The existence of gelbstoff will affect the transfer of radiance in the water column, and then affect the depth of euphotic layer and photosynthesis. Many biogeochemical processes in the ocean, including trace metal complexation, are influenced by the presence of gelbstoff. Accurate estimates of gelbstoff concentrations in the ocean are critical not only to sea-land interaction studies, but also to biogeochemical and ecological studies. In this study in-situ data of the absorption coefficient of gelbstoff (Ag) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the Pearl River estuary were collected at 36 stations from 2 cruises conducted in 25-26 January 2003 and 5-6 January 2004 respectively. The Pearl River Estuary is the largest estuarine system in the South China Sea (SCS) region with eight discharge mouths of the river system and dynamic water mixing processes. The in-situ remote sensing reflectance data were calculated into 6 bands responding to the wavelength ranges of SeaWiFS band 1 to band 6 (412 to 670 nm). The relationships of the measured Ag to 240 band combinations to measured Rrs were analyzed, and the band combination with highest correlation coefficients with Ag was used for algorithm development. A local algorithm for retrieval of gelbstoff absorption coefficient was developed and applied to estimate gelbstoff absorption coefficient from atmospheric corrected SeaWiFS data. The accuracy of remotely-sensed retrieval of gelbstoff was evaluated by comparison to the measured data. The spatial distribution of gelbstoff absorption coefficient in the Pearl River estuary waters was revealed by thematic images retrieved from SeaWiFS data. © 2005 IEEE."

1864471,21349,11104,Monitoring crop biomass accumulation using multi-temporal hyperspectral remote sensing data,2004,"The estimation of the above-ground dry phytomass accumulation is important for monitoring crop growth, predicting potential yield, and estimating crop residues in the context of the carbon cycle. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been proven to be a very effective tool for the estimation of crop variables such as LAI, pigment and water content; therefore it is reasonable to expect that data from hyperspectral remote sensing can show great potential for monitoring crop biomass accumulation, either directly or indirectly through other variables. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between optical indices and either crop dry mass or height using multi-temporal, multi-field hyperspectral data. Using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), hyperspectral data were acquired in three deployments during the 2001 growing season over corn, soybean and wheat fields in the former Greenbelt Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Ottawa. High correlation was observed between the measured above-ground crop dry biomass and the other two parameters, crop height and leaf area index (LAI). The vegetation index MTVI2, calculated from hyperspectral images, was used to estimate the accumulated absorbed photo-synthetically active radiation (APAR) for the monitoring of crop biomass production. Both dry biomass and crop height were highly correlated with the accumulated APAR. For all the samples from the three dates, the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between the estimated APAR and crop dry mass was 0.95, 0.99 and 0.76, and R 2  between the estimated APAR and crop height was 0.90, 0.89 and 0.70 for corn, soybean and wheat, respectively. However, further analysis shows that the correlation between biomass increment and the accumulated APAR during a short period of time is much lower for wheat. This demonstrates that apart from APAR, biomass accumulation is affected by other factors as well"

In order to integrate VHR images into the production of image cartography at medium and large scales, this study concerns the geometric mechanism of VHR images in the orthorectification process working with QuickBird Basic Imagery panchromatic satellite images. The subject was to carry out some control methods to evaluate the geometric accuracy of potential image maps derived of these images. A QuickBird image, acquired over low-relief agricultural zone located 25 Km from the city of Salamanca (Spain), is processed using different geometric modelling and the accuracy of each modelling is evaluated by different procedures. A new approach is presented to check the internal shifts between the different methods. A kind of fiducial marks were added into the scene to create a 'reseau grid'. It lets to control the deformation of several good distributed points called Tie Internal Points (TIP). The control grid gets a good advantage because it controls how the different methods fix in whole warped scenes without knowing terrain coordinates for all of the area. The process is validated by merging TIP, Check Points (CPs), vectorial maps and linear trajectories from GPS devices. TIP show the relative warping for areas without external control. It became a good way to estimate the geometric accuracy and it is coherent with the other method which use terrain coordinates."
2572969,21349,11104,Intercomparison of electromagnetic models for passive microwave remote sensing of snow,2006,"Electromagnetic models can be used for understanding the interaction between electromagnetic waves and matter, interpreting experimental data, and retrieving geophysical parameters. Comparing the results of different snow models, when driven with the same set of input parameters, can benefit remote sensing of snow. Microwave brightness temperatures of snow at 19 and 37 GHz for six different classes of snow (prairie, tundra, taiga, alpine, maritime, and ephemeral) are simulated by means of four different electromagnetic models: the Helsinki University of Technology snow emission model, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks, a dense-medium radiative-transfer theory model, and a strong fluctuation theory model. The frequency behavior of the extinction coefficients obtained with the different models between 5 and 90 GHz is also studied. The four models are also driven with inputs derived from snow-pit data, and the outputs are compared with ground-based measurements of brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. Significant differences among the brightness temperatures and the extinction coefficients simulated with the four models in the cases of the six classes of snow are observed. Moreover, no particular model is found to be able to systematically reproduce all of the experimental data. The results highlight the need to more closely examine the relationships relating mean grain size and correlation length, introduce multiple layers in each model, and to perform controlled laboratory measurements on materials with well-known electromagnetic properties in order to improve the understanding of the causes of the observed differences and to improve model performance."
2261699,21349,11104,The effect of variations in relative spectral response on the retrieval of land surface parameters from multiple sources of remotely sensed imagery,2007,"Airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) images, collected over Sioux Falls, South Dakota, were used to quantify the effect of spectral response on different surface materials and to develop spectral figures-of-merit for spectral responses covering similar, but not identical spectral bands. In this simulation, AVIRIS images were converted to radiance, then spectrally resampled to six wavelength bands commonly used for terrestrial observation. Preliminary results indicate that differences between the simulations can be attributed to variations in surface reflectance within spectral bands, and suggest influences due to water vapor absorption. Radiance simulated from the spectrally narrow Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) relative spectral responses (RSR) was generally higher than that using the broader Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) RSRs over most targets encountered over the test area. This is consistent with many MODIS bands being biased toward shorter wavelengths compared to corresponding ETM+ bands when viewing targets whose radiance decreases with wavelength. In some cases the higher radiance values appeared to occur where the MODIS RSR is better situated over peak reflected wavelengths. Simulation differences between MODIS & ETM+ bands in the near-infrared indicated higher MODIS radiance values that suggest the influence of water vapor absorption at 820 nanometers. This result agreed with water vapor values retrieved from the AVIRIS images themselves at around 2.7 cm precipitable water, and measurements made at a nearby AERONET node at around 2.8 cm during the AVIRIS overflight."
1228780,21349,11104,TerraSAR-X Products and Product Performance Update,2006,"TerraSAR-X is a German satellite to be launched towards end of the year 2006. The SAR instrument built by EADS/Astrium has a multipolarized active phased array antenna and is programmable in wide ranges. This allows to operate imaging modes such as e.g. stripmap, spotlight, ScanSAR and dual-polarization modes. By further dividing the antenna in halves with different position or different polarization, experimental modes for ground moving target detection (GMT) or Quad-Polarization are possible. As a consequence of the various sensor capabilities the tree of SAR products offered by the DLR Ground Segment contains many different variants of polarization, resolution and scene size. Even more product variants are caused by different processing parameters selectable by the user. Some product performance parameters, such as the radiometric accuracy as a function of geometric resolution or the image resolution as a function of incidence angle depend on both, sensor settings (PRF, pulse duration) and on processing parameters (bandwidth, weighting, multi-looking). The processing parameters for the products have been designed by DLR in a way so that valuable products with maximum information content are offered to the user. In order to generate the specified products, the TerraSAR Multi Mode SAR Processor TMSP has been designed by DLR. This processor will be operated at the DLR payload ground segment in Neustrelitz for commercial and scientific customers. The processor will also be operated at additional direct access partner stations of Infoterra GmbH, who will serve private and public customers."
1834123,21349,11104,Using Combined 532 NM HSRL and 1064 NM Elastic-Scatter Lidar Observations to Verify and Update CRAM Dual-Wavelength Aerosol Retrieval Models,2008,"The widely employed Fernald lidar equation solution relation retrieves aerosol backscatter versus height for an assumed aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio, S a , and known system calibration factor, C, at a given wavelength, subject to the constraint/assumption that S a  is spatially constant over the solution layer (height range). At 532 nm, the calibration factor may be estimated fairly accurately by Rayleigh (molecular) normalization in high-altitude, clean-air regions. For elevated aerosol layers embedded in clean air, the direct transmittance approach may be used to estimate the optical depth of the layer, thereby giving an auxiliary input that permits S a  to be determined as a part of the solution. Otherwise, S a  must be specified based on models or determined through use of some other constraining information. The retrieval at 1064 nm is more problematic because the molecular scatter contribution is much weaker, typically making it difficult to either calibrate by molecular normalization or to accurately estimate the transmittance of an elevated aerosol layer, particularly for the weak signals from satellite lidar or eye-safe airborne lidar. As such, aerosol retrievals from dual-wavelength satellite lidars such as those onboard ICESat and CALIPSO have largely been limited to 532 nm retrievals using a table look-up approach to select assumed S a  values based on climatological/geographically determined models. Dual-wavelength retrievals using a Constrained Ratio Aerosol Model-fit (CRAM) retrieval method, employing AERONET based model ratio parameters, have also been obtained with some success for a few satellite lidar data sets."
2355280,21349,11104,The Relationship between the Directional Brightness Temperatures and Hemispherical Thermal Emission over Three Scenes,2008,"Upwelling long wave radiation (UPLW) is one of the key input parameters for many land surface models, and it plays an important role in estimating the energy state of the Earth's surface. Hemispherical LWUP can be determined indirectly by integrating the surface directional brightness temperatures (BT) over the hemisphere. A physical-based model of radiation angular anisotropy over discontinues scene, the Modified Geometric Model (MGP), has been used to estimate hemispherical LWUP from directional BT. The MGP model is developed to simulate directional thermal radiance and it is a highly parameterized model over homogeneous and discontinuous canopy. However, the MGP model has its limitations since it can not describe the reality accurately. At the same time, the directional BT over other scenes should also be simulated to estimate the hemispherical emission using other models because of the complexities of land surface covers. In this study, three physical-based models, MGP, Bi-directional Gaps Model and Therm5a, have been used to investigate the relationship between the directional BT and the hemispherical thermal emission over forest, corn canopy and grass scene, respectively. We firstly introduce the single scattering into the MGP model to describe scene thermal radiance more accurately. Then, extensive thermal emission simulations are conducted under a wide variety of solar illumination and view conditions, component temperatures, vegetation fraction covers and canopy leaf angle distributions. The best substituted angles of hemispherical thermal emission estimates are given over the three scenes. The sensitivity of study is also conducted to determine which surface parameters most strongly affect the relationship over all scenes. Finally, the UPLW are calculated over a forest scene using MGP (after considering the single scattering) and field component temperatures measurements collected during the SAFARI 2001. We compared the results with tower-based pyrgeometer data."

ESRI's ArcView 3.x GIS software and specialized extensions were used to delineate the watershed boundary of the selected project for Flat Creek Watershed in Amelia County, Virginia. Since this study was performed with availing assistance from the USDA-NRCS Water Quality office on the campus of Virginia State University, the geospatial data watershed delineation was calculated using the CE465 Hydrol ArcView Extension with the USGS DEM (digital elevation model) data. Another specialized ArcView Extension called CRWR-raster was used to make a seamless join of multiple raster elevation files needed to cover the entire watershed area. For verification of work the watershed boundary was also calculated by hand using contour lines on the USGS topoquads, overlaid with US EPA RF3 stream segments, and USDA NRCS hydrologic unit boundaries. The information on complex soil spatial and attribute data are from the USDA NRCS SSURGO (National Soil Survey Geospatial Database) and NASIS (National Soil Information System) data sets. These data were converted to the appropriate map projection, imported into the ArcView project, and integrated with the soil Data Viewer extension developed by the USDA NRCS.

A key subsystem aboard SBR is the electronically-steerable digital beamformer (DBF) network that interfaces between 32 smaller subantenna panels in the array and the on-board processing electronics for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indication (MTI). In this paper, we describe the development of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based DBF processor for handling the computationally intensive inner-product operations for wideband, coherent beamforming across the 50 m length of the array.

This design achieves real-time processing at an input data rate of 25.6 Gbit/s. Tests with an antenna array simulator demonstrate that the beamformer performance metrics (0.07/spl deg/ rms phase precision per channel, -35.2 dB peak sidelobe level) will meet the system-level requirements for SAR and MTI operating modes."

1273595,21349,11104,Diffraction effects on the Meteosat Third Generation Infrared Sounder (MTG IRS),2007,"Geostationary Infrared Sounding missions offer good temporal coverage, however due to the large distance to the observed Earth targets the effect of diffraction is increased compared to sounding from a low Earth orbit (LEO). Because of the wave-length dependence of diffraction, the spectral channels do not sample the same volume of air, as in general assumed by retrieval algorithms for LEO IR (Infrared) sounder data. This additional error introduced in the retrieval by diffraction limited instruments is called 'pseudo noise' throughout the paper. One such diffraction-limited geostationary system is the candidate Infrared Sounding (IRS) mission on EUMETSAT Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) satellites with a planned need date in 2015, due to the expected lifetime of the current Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites. A simplified Point Spread Function (PSF) is applied. To represent the channels within natural conditions, measured spectra from the low-earth orbit Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) at DeltaX = 15 km, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at DeltaX = 4 km are used as an underlying scene when integrating over the PSF. The results show that the pseudo noise is highly depending on wavelength, and highest in the window and CO2 regions (within the broader 700-1200 cm-1, or 8.3-14.3 mum, region). The worst case pseudo noise values are approximately 1 K for these regions. The broad-band AIRS results are confirmed by a direct comparison to MODIS data at 4 km resolution, where the worst case pseudo noise is appx. 0.5 K, while the best case pseudo noise is comparable to AIRS data."
722640,21349,11104,Agent-based rumor spreading models for human geography applications,2012,"In this paper, two rumor spreading models to investigate information spread in disaster scenarios are described. In the experiments shown, the impact of various scenario parameters were examined in terms of percentage of agents able to reach a shelter within a prescribed amount of time. Future work will include adding rumors for information other than the availability of evacuation shelters. For example, additional rumors on traffic or road closings and conditions will be included. The inclusion of traffic and road information will cause agents to consider and update paths to evacuation shelters based on each agent's individual knowledge of the road structure and the information that gets passed to them. Furthermore, in the second rumor-spreading model, agents have some level of skepticism about the rumors. They must hear a rumor several times before trusting the information. The level of an agent's skepticism or how an agent perceives information may be related to personality. Future work will incorporate personality traits into each agent and these traits will be used to modulate how agents perceive and make use of the rumors they hear."

However, specific post-processing is often required to remove possible artifacts on tiles junctions. In this paper, we aim at showing that a simple tiling strategy with partially overlapping tiles can be applied to a 2-nd order variational segmentation method based on the minimization of the Blake-Zisserman functional, in such a way that tile boundaries are coherent without any need of specific post-processing. Moreover, the energy minimization is performed on each tile with Dirichlet initial boundary conditions; thus, tiles are independent and the whole procedure is parallelizable with independent tiles."

The seasonality question provides an important threshold test to advance predictions of tropical forest response to future climate changes. Despite its importance, spatial and temporal photosynthesis patterns in tropical forests are highly uncertain and remain controversial as ecosystem models yield divergent results while satellite-based observations are subject to various artifacts associated with cloud leakage, aerosols, and sensor-sun observation geometries. In this research, in situ seasonal tower carbon flux and leaf-scale phenology measures from cameras were combined with satellite data to investigate the roles of climate drivers and biologic processes (leaf phenology and demography traits) on vegetation canopy photosynthesis. Our results show the importance of phenology traits on controls on seasonal photosynthesis."

Therefore it is very likely that, in a classification problem, most pixels in a superpixel belong to the same class, namely if the homogeneity criterion is compatible with the class statistics. Superpixels are, therefore, a powerful device to express spatial contextual information. However, the exploitation of superpixels in a principled way is not straightforward. Recent efforts attack this problem under a discrete optimization framework, by including regularization terms promoting consistence of the labels in the superpixels and computing approximate labelings with graph-cut algorithms. The well known hardness of integer optimization problems is a major limitation of this line of attack. In this paper, we introduce a new strategy, based on convex relaxation, to include the spatial information provided by superpixels in classification problems. The convex relaxation of an integer optimization problem opens a door to include extra information, such as spatial partitioning information given by over-segmented superpixels. The convex optimization problem thus obtained is solved by using SALSA algorithm. Experimental results with the ROSIS Pavia University dataset illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
2933882,21349,11104,Multilabel classification of UAV images with Convolutional Neural Networks,2016,"In this paper, we present a multilabel classification method for images acquired by means of Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAV) over urban areas. Due to the fact that UAV-grabbed images are characterized by extremely high spatial resolution, usual recognition schemes (such as traditional satellite or airborne based images) are likely to fail. In this work, tile-based multilabel classification framework is adopted to overcome such issue. In particular, a given UAV-shot image is first subdivided into a grid of equal tiles. Next, deep neural network-induced features are extracted from each tile and then fed into a radial basis function neural network classifier in order to infer the corresponding object list. We apply a refinement step at the top of the complete deep network architecture to boost the classification results. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset acquired over the city of Trento, Italy with an hexacopter UAV. Superior classification rates have been scored with respect to the state-of-the-art."
2901074,21349,11104,Classification of groundwater potential in Chaoyang area based on QUEST algorithm,2016,"QUEST (Quick, Unbiased, and Efficient Statistical Tree) algorithm has been widely applied to the remote sensing characteristic classification, for its high speed and precision compared to other decision tree algorithms. This paper took Chaoyang, western Liaoning province as the study area and integrated RS (Remote Sensing), GIS (Geographic Information System) and QUEST to classify the groundwater potential. Initially, Five thematic layers, viz., lithology, geomorphology, slope, NDVI, NDWI were considered as the indicator factors. Then, 21 draining wells were investigated and divided into four classes, ‘Very Good’, ‘Good’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Poor’, and the decision tree was generated with QUEST method. Finally, four classes of groundwater potential zones were demarcated in the study area and verified with the yield of 14 wells, and the result was found satisfactory with the accuracy of 92.8%."

The proposed method is based on Wilcoxon rank sum test and mean absolute deviation (MAD) model with color feature and can segment roads and residential areas from vegetation more accurately. Three steps are used to realize the new method. First, we use blue and green color components as paired sample on Wilcoxon rank sum test to partition the vegetation. Second, a road-residential area map is constructed by mean absolute deviation on an improved two dimensional histogram to get the optimal threshold for segmentation. Finally, we fuse vegetation and residential map to get the final segmentation result. Compared with several existing algorithms, the proposed method presents a more accurate segmentation."

Methods based on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), combining with some conventional phase unwrapping algorithm can be used to achieve this purpose. In this paper, MLE integrated with weighted multigrid phase-unwrapping method for high-sloped terrain profile reconstruction is presented and studied in detail. The performance of this method is also analyzed. Experiment result using simulated InSAR data shows that the method can be used to reconstruct high-sloped terrain with relatively high accuracy."

2969497,21349,11104,Sensor-agnostic photogrammetric image registration with applications to population modeling,2016,"While wide area motion imagery provides short-timescale temporal information, e.g., individual vehicle tracking, it lacks broader contextual information on the ambient distribution of populations within that area. We present a fusion approach to augment Iris video with broader-scale population data. Spectral, geometric, and geospatial limitations of the Iris video preclude the use of Iris video directly; this is overcome by photogrammetric registration of robust Deimos-2 imagery and ancillary processed products using a high performance sensoragnostic, multi-temporal registration workflow. We assess the accuracy and precision of the proposed workflow (∼15 m; Euclidean) and demonstrate the potential to leverage the fusion of these data towards rapid, global-scale population distribution modeling. This has important implications to effective response to emergencies, especially in urban environments, where population density is driven largely by building heights, and a complementary, multi-scale understanding of the distribution and dynamics of people within that geographic area is required."
1752344,21349,11104,Comparison of ENVISAT RA2 backscatter results over global land surface,2011,"Unlike ERS1/2 and JASON1, ENVISAT RA2 provides the backscatter coefficient from four retrackers (Ocean, Ice1, Ice2, SeaIce), which is useful to study the behavior of RA2 backscatter over land. This paper presented an analysis of RA2 four Ku band backscatter performance over global, especially over vegetated area, and provided a detailed comparison with JASON1 data. The temporal evolution of the RA2 backscatter coefficients was evaluated for main vegetation type (ENF, EBF, DNF, DBF, mixed forest, croplands, savannas, grasslands) from October 2004 to June 2009. Results indicated that Sigma0 values from four retrackers show large variability. The backscatter of Ice1 and SeaIce retrackers are systematic larger than that of the Ocean and SeaIce. The inter-comparison with JASON1 showed that the greatest degree of correlation of the RA2 Sigma0 with JASON1 is obtained with Ice1 and SeaIce."
2923729,21349,9704,A myopic Monte Carlo strategy for the partially observable travelling salesman problem,2016,"In this paper, we present two greedy, myopic algorithms for solving the partially observable travelling salesman problem. Although not optimal from a decision-theoretic viewpoint, these strategies are shown to perform reasonably well under the uncertain conditions of the environment. The first algorithm is a strictly greedy algorithm and has no tunable parameters, whereas the second algorithm uses Monte Carlo sampling to determine likely configurations of the environment and applies value iteration to pick an action. We present both approaches with illustrative examples and empirically demonstrate their relative strengths and weaknesses."
1978973,21349,9078,Near-lossless compression of coherent image data,2001,"Near-lossless compression, yielding a strictly bounded reconstruction error, is extended to preserve the radiometric resolution of data produced by coherent imaging systems. A noncausal DPCM, based on the rational Laplacian pyramid (RLP), recently introduced by the authors for despeckling, is adjusted to this purpose. The baseband icon of the RLP is DPCM encoded, the intermediate layers are uniformly quantized, and the bottom layer is logarithmically quantized. As a consequence, the relative error, i.e., pixel ratio of original to decoded image, can be strictly bounded by the quantization step size of the bottom layer of the RLP."
1649427,21349,9078,Tailoring non-homogeneous Markov chain wavelet models for hyperspectral signature classification,2014,"We consider the application of non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain (NHMC) models to the problem of hyperspectral signature classification. It has been previously shown that the NHMC model enables the detection of several semantic structural features of hyperspectral signatures. However, there are some aspects of the spectral data that are not fully captured by the proposed NHMC models such as the relatively smooth but fluctuating regions and the fluctuation orientations. In order to address these limitations, we propose an improved NHMC model based on Daubechies-1 wavelets in conjunction with an increased the model complexity. Experimental results show that the revised approach outperforms existing approaches relevant in classification tasks."
1070501,21349,9078,Wide-baseline image change detection,2014,We present a fully automated method for the detection of changes within a scene between a reference and a sample image whose viewing angles differ by up to 30°. We also describe an extension to the SIFT technique that allows extracted feature points to be matched over wider viewing angles. Matched correspondences between reference and sample images are used to construct a Delaunay triangulation and changes are detected by comparing triangles after affine compensation using a dense SIFT metric. False positives are reduced by using a novel technique introduced as local plane matching (LPM) to match mean-shift segments in unmatched areas using the homographies of local planes to compensate for perspective distortions. The method is shown to achieve pixel-level equal error rates of 5% at a 10° azimuth view angle difference.

Daily observation data from 53 in situ rainfall gauges is obtained to do the pixel-point comparison. Two aspects (rainfall amount and occurrence) were taken to evaluate the performance of these two satellite precipitation products. The result demonstrates that: (1) both TRMM3B42 V7 and GPM 3IMERGHH have an underestimation of rainfall over MRB; (2) the performance of the two products in wet season is better than dry season; (3) generally TRMM3B42V7 can achieve a better estimation of rainfall amount than GPM 3IMERGHH during both wet season and dry season; (4) for event judge, GPM can get a better result than TRMM3B42 V7 with a higher Probability of Detection (POD) and a higher Critical Success Index (CSI); (5) TRMM3B42 V7 is more likely to miss a rainfall event while GPM is more likely to make a false alarms. This study shows that although GPM has more capacity to catch a rainfall event, it still has much room for further improvement, especially in the estimation of rainfall amount in dry season."

Voxel-based LAD distribution was derived from the data, and the distribution was applied to radiative transfer simulation to quantify solar transmittance and APAR. Subsequently, direct solar transmittance and transpiration rate of trees were calculated for an actual urban district, and several evaluations of these effects were performed. It was shown that the present method was able to quantify the cooling effects of trees while considering their structure, layout, and spatial geometry of the surrounding buildings."
2900772,21349,11104,Scattering center modelling based on compressed sensing principle from under-sampling scattering field data,2016,"It has been proved that scattering center modeling for narrow band signals can be achieved through the optimum image matching of time-frequency representation (TFR). In order to obtain TFR, however, the azimuth sampling interval should be quite small for electrically large target, which results in a huge amount of electromagnetic computation. Under the situation of under-sampling scattered waves, aliasing distortions of the Doppler curves of scattering centers will be caused in TFR, which makes it hard to estimate the parameters of corresponding scattering centers from TFR. To deal with this problem, an approach for scattering center modelling from under-sampling scattered waves are presented in this paper. The random under-sampling scattered waves based on the principle of compressive sensing are applied to acquire the non-aliasing Doppler curves of scattering centers in TFR. The feasibility of this method has been validated by the simulation results."

2933760,21349,11104,A generalized statistical model for binary change detection in multispectral images,2016,"Recently, a thresholding method based on the Rayleigh-Rice mixture has been proposed for solving binary change detection problems in multispectral image pairs. However, when images acquired by the last generation of multispectral scanners having high radiometric resolution are considered, the distribution fitting is still not satisfactory and computed thresholds remain quite distant from the optimal values. The main reason for this seems to be that in all previous approaches the unchange class is modeled as a single class. Instead, both practice and recent studies showed that this is not the case for new generation data. In this work, we propose a generalized statistical model for the difference image that allows the unchange class to be complex. The resulting model has more degrees of freedom, therefore it better fits real distributions and returns almost optimal thresholds for binary decision also with high radiometric resolution images."
2900437,21349,11104,An improved method of compensating the mutual coupling effect for aperture synthesis radiometers,2016,"In aperture synthesis radiometers (ASRs), the mutual coupling effect between antennas is a key problem, which degrades the performance of ASRs and should be compensated. In this paper, an improved compensation method is proposed for ASRs, which is based on the receiving mutual impedance. The proposed method is verified by a one-dimension 5-channel L-band ASR. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior over the existing method based on the transmitting mutual impedance, and is more appropriate to compensate the mutual coupling effect for ASRs."

The EO data produced are drastically expanding in precision, quantity and size. However, the capacity of managing, retrieving and reasoning the big EO data from heterogeneous EO data sources across the world is very limited. In this paper, we propose a data model to develop mechanisms of describing geographical resources using properties, expressing the relations in EO data, and capturing the implicit knowledge in the given facts. We formalize the model using first order logic and demonstrate the implementation of the model using OWL and Jena."

As preliminary research, backscatter and its ratio from Sentinel-1 (C-band dual polarization SAR), and NDVI from Sentinel-2 (13 bands multi-spectral data) are assessed by using the NDVIR biomass model. Then the fusion biomass model is proposed based on shrub volume formations. The fusion model is verified by filed survey data which measured shrub height and diameter applyied into the allometric model.

2900445,21349,11104,A new method for attitude refinement of earth observation satellite with asynchronous images,2016,"The accuracy of attitude observation is always the main contributor to geometric performance of earth observation satellites (EOSs). Given the ground process requirement, linear pushbroom and asynchronous imaging sensors are widely used in EOSs, such as multispectral sensor with sequential line arrays, three-line array sensor in stereo mapping satellite, panchromatic sensor with multiple non-collinear CCD chip in some high-resolution optical satellite. By using the images of those sensors, this paper proposes a method, which is based on image registration approach, rigorous forward intersection and bundle adjustment technology, to refine attitude data of satellite for improving geometric performance of images. Preliminary experiments, which used multi-sensors asynchronous images of Chinese Mapping Satellite-1-02, demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of improving internally coincident precision of attitude data without ground control points. In particular, relative positioning accuracy of images can be directly improved, and absolute positioning accuracy can consequently be improved via additionally using a few GCPs in the stripe image data."

It is hard to recognize film-like oil even at the field and more complex to discriminate film-like oil than thick oil from the satellite data because it shows similar appearance with sea water color and their widespread distributions. In this respect, it is significant that we has developed the algorithm for film-like oil. And also we figured out the effects of tidal current and wind driven current to the movement of oil spill by particle tracking."
2959888,21349,11104,Model selection for high resolution InSAR coherence statistics over urban areas and its application in building detection,2016,"The interferometric coherence map is derived from the cross-correlation of two registered synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. It can give additional information complementary to the intensity image, or act as an independent information source in many applications. Compared to the plenty of work on SAR intensity statistics, there are quite fewer researches on the statistical characters of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence. And to our knowledge, all of the existing work that related to InSAR coherence statistics, models the coherence with Gaussian distribution with no discrimination on data resolutions or scene types. Our main contribution is the investigation on the accuracies of several typical models for high resolution coherence statistics over urban areas. We select three typical land classes including trees, buildings, and shadow, as the representatives of urban areas. And different models including Gaussian, Weibull, Rayleigh, Nakagami and Beta are evaluated. Experiment results on TanDEM-X data illustrate that the Beta model reveals a better performance than other distributions. Finally, the Beta model is used in the detection of buildings."

Using the 8 day composite 500m resolution MODIS reflectance data, we examined interannual variation of vegetation greenness and water body surface area in this area from 2000 to 2014. The annual mean NDVI was increasing in the entire region, with 34.02% significantly improved and only 3.2% deteriorated. The surface area of major lakes in plain area showed a significant shrinking trend. As a case study, their relationship with human settlement development was examined in Manas river valley with multi-temporal Landsat data. Our results indicate the anthropogenic impacts on environmental change in dryland Xinjiang in addition to climate change."

These algorithms are computationally very involved, and often cannot be executed on problems of reasonable size. In this work, we present a new algorithm for solving the unmixing problem when spectral variability is present. The algorithm uses a library-based approach to describe the variability present in each class, and executes an alternating optimization with respect to these libraries. The optimization problem itself is constructed as an angle minimization problem by exploiting the geometrical interpretation of the unmixing problem. This results in an algorithm which yields almost identical results as MESMA, but is computationally much more favorable."
2923195,21349,11104,Spatial scale effect on vegetation phenological analysis using remote sensing data,2016,"Spatial scale effects, defined as the phenomenon that the estimates at multiple resolution are inconsistent, have aroused wide concerns in remote sensing studies. But very few studies have paid attention to the effects of scale on phenological studies. This paper investigated the scale effects in estimating phenological transitional dates from remote sensing data. A prior-knowledge vegetation index (VI) time series at 30 m resolution was composed, based on which the time series at 240 m, 480 m and 960 m were derived. The green-up onset and dormancy onset dates were then estimated from the VI time series using a double-logistic plant growth model. The derived estimates at multiple resolutions were compared and the effects of spatial scales were verified. Landscape heterogeneities were found to be related to spatial scale effects. The changes in the estimated green-up onset dates and dormancy onset dates exhibited different patterns with the coarsening of spatial resolution."

The results manifest that the four products agree well in most of northern regions of China, with higher correlation coefficient and the same response to meteorological factors. The phenology matches well for different biome types, reaching the peak in July or August. The changing trend of LAI from 2001–2011 is almost same for four products, with approximately 56% greening and 44% browning. However, abrupt changes occur at different time among four products. LAI is positively correlated with meteorological station annual average precipitation and temperature, while negatively correlated with annual average sunshine duration in spatial scale."
2551447,21349,9078,Reduction of vibration-induced artifacts in synthetic-aperture-radar imagery using the fractional fourier transform,2012,"In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of objects exhibiting low-level vibrations are accompanied by localized artifacts, or ghost targets, caused by the micro-Doppler present in the returned SAR signals. Conventional Fourier-transform-based SAR processing techniques are not fit to remove ghosting effects prior to image formation due to the non-stationary nature of the returned signals from vibrating objects. Recently, a method based on the discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) has been developed for estimating the instantaneous vibration accelerations and vibrating frequencies from returned SAR signals. Here, a novel image de-ghosting algorithm for vibrating targets in SAR imagery is proposed by employing the DFrFT-based vibration-estimation algorithm. The proposed de-ghosting method is applied to SAR data collected by the Lynx SAR system. Experimental results show a substantial reduction in ghosting caused by a 1.5-cm amplitude, 0.8-Hz vibration present in a test target."

Statistical analysis of hyperspectral data including one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and spectral instability analysis (ISI) were used to identify the most effective wavelengths in mapping and differentiating the five cultivars with different tolerance to ozone damage. Our results show several distinctive spectral regions that can be used for effective crop type mapping within species level, and quantifying the effects of ozone damage at leaf and canopy scales.

It allows the correction of polarimetric distortions of the radar system using only three types of calibration target: trihedral, dihedral, the 22.5° and 45°-rotated dihedral corner reflectors. The method is simple, accurate and yet robust in terms of field deployment in some cases. Evaluation and testing of the algorithm was made at microwave anechoic chamber measurements, numerical simulation, and airborne L-band Pi-SAR data. It is found that the amplitude error can be achieved to as small as 0.5dB, while the phase error is within 5° in high resolution of Pi-SAR system. Due to the sensitivity of 22.5°-rotated dihedral to rotation angle, it is not recommended to use the 22.5° -rotated dihedral for polarimetric calibration."

In another study, we proposed a method based on Z-scores of Season-Trend model Residuals (Z-STR), which can continuously detects anomaly regions in image time series. However, Z-STR only detects anomalies with large shifts but cannot detect anomalies with small or gradual shifts. To improve the effectiveness of continuous anomaly detection, in this study, we propose a new method based on Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of Season-Trend model Residuals (EWMA-STR). Experiment for detecting spatial-temporal anomaly regions caused by severe flooding validated the better performance of EWMA-STR than Z-STR for time series anomaly detection. By using information of all historical time series data, EWMA-STR can detects anomalies with small or gradual shifts as well as anomalies with large or abrupt shifts."

The proposed method is based on an explicit hierarchical graph-based model that is sufficiently flexible to deal with multisource coregistered time series of images collected at different spatial resolutions. An especially novel element of the proposed approach is the use of multiple quad-trees in cascade, each associated with an image acquired at a different date, with the aim to characterize the temporal correlations associated with distinct images in an input time series. Experimental results are shown with multitemporal and multiresolution Pleiades data."
1423632,21349,11104,New cascade model for hierarchical joint classification of multisensor and multiresolution remote sensing data,2015,"This paper addresses the problem of multisensor fusion of COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT-2 data together with optical imagery for classification purposes. The proposed method is based on an explicit hierarchical graph-based model that is sufficiently flexible to deal with multisource coregistered images collected at different spatial resolutions by different sensors. An especially novel element of the proposed approach is the use of multiple quad-trees in cascade, each associated with a set of images acquired by different SAR sensors, with the aim to characterize the correlations associated with distinct images from different instruments. Experimental results are shown with COSMO-SkyMed, RADARSAT-2, and Pleiades data 1 ."
