673218,21220,8494,Development of the hydrogen gas sensor for the nondestructive test evaluation (NDE) application,1999,"In this paper, a sensor material with Fe/Zr multilayer thin film, in which the change in the magnetization and strain with hydrogenation is maximized, was developed. Compositionally modulated Fe/Zr multilayers with a Fe/sub 80/Zr/sub 20/ composition and modulation wavelengths 3-50 angstroms were deposited by sequentially sputtering (RF diode) elemental Fe and Zr targets. The films were electrolytically hydrogenated to select the optimum Fe/Zr multilayers that show the maximum increases in the magnetization and strain with hydrogenation. The changes in the magnetic properties of the thin films after hydrogenation were measured using a hysteresis graph and the strains induced in the films by hydrogenation were measured using a laser heterodyne interferometer. The optimum sensor material selected was incorporated in a fiber-optic hydrogen sensor by depositing it directly on the sensing arm of a fiber-optic Michelson interferometer. The developed sensor is expected to be useful for detecting easily and accurately the subsurface corrosion in structural systems."
1370120,21220,8494,Teaching electronic circuits online: Lessons from MITx's 6.002x on edX,2013,"6.002x is the first electronic circuits course to be taught online to tens of thousands of students. The goal of the 6.002x experiment was to explore ways to use computer assisted instruction to surpass the quality of traditional residential teaching. By providing superior on-line content delivery and assessment, we hope to both be able to educate people without access to education, and to improve residential education by allowing professors to focus on higher value tasks. We improved on the classroom experience in several ways. Students can actively monitor their current levels of mastery and to self-pace in response. They can identify and break through misconceptions before moving on to more advanced material. The massive scale of the classroom has participants on-line 24/7, allowing students to ask questions and receive peer answers in almost real-time. The platform allows for substantial data collection on testing, allowing us to incrementally and scientifically improve courses. Finally, the amount of effort that can be invested into a course is much greater when it can be amortized across tens of thousands. In order to achieve this, we had to overcome a number of challenges: finding mechanisms to allow automated grading, overcoming the lack of in-person interactions, and overcoming the lack of student access to laboratory equipment. The course was shown successful in both residential and mass-scale settings."
861397,21220,11470,Developments on the Boston 256-channel retinal implant,2013,"A hermetic neurostimulator is being developed to restore functional sight to the blind. The latest developments are presented on the Boston 256-channel retinal prosthesis. The device includes a hermetic package made of titanium and alumina, containing an integrated circuit chip with 256 independently addressable current drivers. The prosthesis attaches to the outside scleral wall of the eye and electrically drives a microfabricated thin-film polyimide array of sputtered iridium oxide electrodes. This array is implanted in the subretinal space via a flap in the sclera. The implanted device receives power and stimulation data wirelessly via inductively coupled coils. A circuit to prevent residual electrode voltage and improve safety is being designed for incorporation into future devices. The components of our prosthesis have been tested, and we plan to implant the 256-channel device in animals this year."
1390088,21220,8494,Frequency scaling of power reclamation networks in outphasing PA architectures,2012,"Outphasing power amplifiers (PAs) with power reclamation networks are an attractive solution for maintaining a constant PA load during outphasing while minimizing energy lost. Power reclamation networks have only been demonstrated at frequencies below 2 GHz. In this work, we examine power reclamation networks for outphasing PA topologies and investigate how their efficiency scales with frequency. Our results show that at mm-wave frequencies, power reclamation network efficiency is dominated by the current in the resonant portion of the rectifier and that this loss can increase disproportionately with frequency, thus placing a key limitation on the efficiency of power reclamation networks at mm-wave frequencies."
527754,21220,8494,Modelling of multidimensional (MD) heat diffusion via the Kirchhoff paradigm,2015,"Motivated by gas dynamics, we consider the heat diffusion equation which in its standard form allows propagation at an infinite speed, and is thus unphysical. Driven by phenomenological considerations rooted in analogies with RC-transmission lines, we introduce a modified 3D heat equation for an isotropic medium that admits MD internally passive circuit realization using resistances, nonlinear inductances, and capacitances of the type previously introduced elsewhere, which via standard techniques can be transformed into well-known Wave Digital networks in the discrete MD domain."
1107883,21220,8494,Shortcuts in circuits and systems education with a case study of the Thévenin/Helmholtz and Norton/Mayer equivalents,2012,"Basic Circuits and Systems CAS education is crucial in the first phase of any electrical engineering curriculum, but increasingly under threat. This situation is in many ways similar to that of mathematics education in engineering. Creative shortcuts for teaching mathematics have recently been advocated in the “streetfighting mathematics approach”. Similar innovative, alternative ways can make the basic CAS education more effective. This special session aims to provide a forum where colleagues across the globe come together to share best practices, such as jewels or pedagogical shortcuts, and where they propose modern circuits, signals, and systems curricula for various target student audiences and discuss other related issues. Here we survey the contributions and discuss a case study, namely, the Thevenin/Helmholtz and Norton/Mayer equivalents."
2863758,21220,8494,Two-pass beamforming for ultrasound imaging,2016,"We propose a simple two-pass beamforming scheme that combines adaptive and nonadaptive methods to achieve high-quality ultrasound images at low computational cost. During the first pass, our beamformer processes buffered input vectors using an inexpensive nonadaptive method and computes the corresponding envelope. Based on that envelope information, selected outputs may be recomputed during the second pass (to improve beamforming performance) using an expensive adaptive method. The purpose of the first pass is to identify which nonadaptively-beamformed outputs can be spared from a heavy computational load of adaptive beamforming taking place during the second pass. In t his work, our beamforming scheme combines the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer and the adaptive Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC), and it selects outputs for recomputation based on a threshold window. We have evaluated our scheme using simulated ultrasound images of a 12-point phantom and a point-scatterer-cyst phantom, achieving substantial threshold-dependent computational savings while maintaining acceptable image resolution and contrast, compared to pure GSC beamforming."
2866201,21220,8494,Infrastructural health monitoring using self-powered Internet-of-Things,2016,"By incorporating sensing capabilities in passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging technology it is possible to extend the coverage of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to monitor the health of different segments of a large civil infrastructure like pavement highway, buildings or a multi-span bridge. The challenge in this regard is to deliver energy to the RFID sensors that are embedded inside the structures in a manner that they can continuously sense for occurrence of any rare structural events. This paper summarizes some of the progress that has been made to-date in the area of self-powered R FID sensor networks within the concept of IoT. The core sensor uses a self-powering method which directly harvests computational and storage energy from slight strain-variations in the structure. The event signatures can then be stored on a non-volatile memory and remotely retrieved at a later period of time. In this “sense now retrieve later” paradigm, self-powering is only used for continuous sensing and data-logging of essential statistics; whereas, data retrieval and reconfiguration is achieved using a low-cost commercial RFID system. Another advantage of using a commercial RFID system for data retrieval is that the related standards and FCC compliance are well established and the technology can be easily integrated with other IoT network infrastructure."
2897211,21220,30,A wide range and high sensitivity four-channel compact electrochemical biosensor for neurotransmitter detection on a microfluidic platform,2016,"We present a four-channel, high-sensitivity and linearity electrochemical biosensor for neurotransmitter (NT) detection and measurement. Using a multi-channel microfluidic platform makes this biosensor capable of detecting NT-related currents going from nanoamperes to milliamperes, with a sensitivity of the order of picoamperes. Moreover, by using a fully differential potentiostat architecture, the biosensor offers a high common-mode rejection ratio (90 dB), making it appropriate for low-noise and high-sensitive applications. The system was implemented on a 15 mm × 15 mm PCB with direct interface to the microfluidic chambers. It was calibrated with a 5 mM ferrocyanide solution and successfully tested with dopamine at three concentrations. The system shows a minimum sensistivity of 100 pA and consumes 60 mW."
2905481,21220,8494,"A 48 μW, 8.88 × 10−3 W/W batteryless energy harvesting BCC identification system",2016,"A BCC identification system which is fully compatible with previous radio frequency identification (RFID) systems is proposed in order to reduce power consumption, avoid security breaches, and enhance convenience via an intuitive interface. The BCC identification system is composed of a reader and a tag. The reader sends an RF wave to the tag, receives an identification code, and analyzes the received code. The tag harvests energy from the RF wave transmitted by the reader, and transfers the identification code to the reader. The energy harvester in the BCC identification tag increases power conversion efficiency (PCE) by up to 12% by adaptively changing the number of rectifier stages depending on input power. In addition, a transformer reusing an on-off keying (OOK) BCC transmitter is proposed to inform the reader of completion of energy harvesting of the tag by changing load impedance. As a result, a 48 μW, 8.88×10−3 W/W Figure-of-Merit (FoM) BCC identification system is implemented. This system can generate sufficient power in the tag with lower transmitted power from the reader compared to previous RFID systems."
2226054,21220,8335,Low-power implementation of H.324 audiovisual codec dedicated to mobile computing,1998,"A VLSI implementation of the H.324 audiovisual codec is described. A number of sophisticated low-power architectures have been devised dedicatedly for the mobile use. A set of specific functional units, each corresponding to a process of H.263 video codec, is employed to lighten different performance bottlenecks. A compact DSP core composed of two MAC units is used for both ACELP and MP-MLQ coding schemes of the G.723.1 speech codec. The proposed audiovisual codec core has been implemented by using 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS 4LM technology, which contains totally 420 K transistors with the dissipation of 224.32 mW from single 3.3 V supply."
2423094,21220,369,An Efficient VLSI Architecture of a Layered Space-Time Receiver,2007,"This paper presents a practical implementation of a layered space-time (LST) receiver targeting a Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA. The architecture is based on multipass burst processing, and includes burst buffers for each antenna, channel parameter estimation modules exploiting a training sequence, and a simple matrix inversion adaptation mechanism. LST architectures involve significant implementation complexity and various refinements have been proposed in the literature to mitigate this aspect. Our receiver is based on novel modifications to the standard LST algorithm which enable unprecedented implementation simplicity, avoiding complex operations such as divisions and square roots, while suffering a negligible BER degradation."
2871299,21220,8494,Multiobjective path planning on uneven terrains based on NAMOA,2016,"Existing path planning algorithms are capable of finding physically feasible, shortest, and energy-efficient paths for mobile robots navigating on uneven terrains. However, shortest paths on uneven terrains are often energy inefficient while energy-optimal paths usually take long time to be traversed. Therefore, due to time and energy constraints imposed on mobile robots, these shortest and energy-optimal paths might not be applicable. We propose a multiobjective path planner that can find pareto-optimal solutions in terms of path length and energy consumption. It is based on NAMOA∗ search algorithm that utilizes a proposed monotone heuristic cost function. The simulation results show that nondominated path options found by the proposed path planner can be very useful in many real-world applications."
2832717,21220,8494,A quasi-digital pressure/touch sensor prototype for orbital targets contact event monitoring,2016,"This paper presents a sensorized belt with four fully integrated pressure-touch sensors. We propose a very-low complexity sensor able to measure a pressure variation (up to 4 MPa) and to identify with accuracy a contact event at around 10 kPa. The overall pressure/touch sensor integrates a transducer, based on piezo capacitive material, coupled with a read-out circuit designed around a ring-oscillator. This converts the capacitance variation of the transducer into a quasi-digital signal characterized by a frequency range of 36.3–270 kHz with a very low standard deviation (2.3 kHz) and a sensitivity of 2.2 Hz/Pa. The tight integration of the electronics with the transducer results in a very compact all-in-one sensor system (overall size is 20 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm). Further, a major benefit of a low complexity design is the low power consumption, measured to be ∼370 μW. Based on a quasi-digital approach (event-driven), the system is well suited for impulse-based wireless communication."
2906627,21220,8494,A hardware security solution against scan-based attacks,2016,"Scan based Design for Test (DfT) schemes have been in wide use to increase the testability of digital circuits. The main objective is to ensure that nodes in the Circuit Under Test (CUT) are controllable and observable. While such comprehensive access is highly desirable for testing, it is not acceptable for secure chips as it is subject to exploitation. In this work, a new method is presented to protect the sensitive information from attackers using scan chains. The access through the scan chain to the circuit containing the secret information has been severely limited to reduce the risk of a scan-based attack. To ensure the testability of the circuit, a built-in self-test utilizing an LFSR is considered. The proposed scheme can be used as countermeasure against side channel attacks with a low area overhead as compared to the reported solutions."
2864349,21220,8494,Class D CMOS power amplifier with on/off logic for a multilevel outphasing transmitter,2016,"In this paper, we present a class D power amplifier (PA) design in 28 nm CMOS for a multilevel outphasing transmitter. For increased output power, the design consists of eight unit PAs with cascoded output stages. In order to improve back-off efficiency from conventional outphasing, the PAs are switched on and off in pairs for different amplitude levels, which is challenging to implement with cascoded class D. As a solution, we introduce a new on/off switching method based on logic gates utilizing two square wave voltages to produce either a similar square wave or a constant voltage. This method enables a higher level of integration by using low-voltage digital signals for on/off control, while eliminating the timing mismatch between output transistors caused by a level shifter. The simulated peak output power of the PA is 32.4 dBm, and its peak efficiency is 34.1%."

2867348,21220,8494,"A 1V, −26dBm sensitive auto configurable mixed converter mode RF energy harvesting with wide input range",2016,A maximum power point tracking DC-DC boost converter and reconfigurable rectifier to harvest energy from ambient RF source in an auto-configurable mixed converter mode is presented. A reconfigurable rectifier with adjustable rectifier stages in the high input power range(−16dBm to −8dBm) and a boost converter with adaptive control in the low input power level range(−26dBm to −17dBm) to maximize the efficiency is proposed. The system is designed at UHF band(900MHz) to drive a load with 1V and shows a peak efficiency of 62.8% at −20dBm and 78.2% at −12dBm and it is implemented using UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology.
2888444,21220,8494,Self-powered sensing and time-stamping of rare events using CMOS Fowler-Nordheim tunneling timers,2016,This paper explores the use of continuous-time Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling for implementing self-powered CMOS sensors that can be used to simultaneously measure and time-stamp occurrences of rare signal events. At the core of the proposed design is a floating-gate device where the FN based electron tunneling is induced through the thin gate-oxide and the control gate is used to couple the signal that is being measured and time-stamped. The signal then modulates the shape of the FN tunneling barrier which is captured by the tunneling rate of electrons being stored on the floating-gate. Thus the sensor continuously operates without the need for any external powering and the data from the sensor can be retrieved to reconstruct the occurrence of events offline. The proof-of-concept has been validated using prototypes fabricated in a standard 0.5-μm CMOS process and the measurement results show that less than 100 fJ of sensing energy is required for event recording and time-stamping.
2438747,21220,8228,A Two-Stage Sensing Technique for Dynamic Spectrum Access,2008,"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a promising approach for mitigating spectrum scarcity. Underlying DSA is the need for fast and reliable spectrum sensing over a potentially large band. In N.M. Neihart, et al., (May 2007), the concept of two-stage sensing scheme was introduced. In this work, we develop models for performance analysis based on mean time to detect an idle channel. Simulation results show that two-stage sensing leads to faster detection than conventional single-stage random search. System-level issues such as the impact of bandwidth of coarse sensing block and sensing duration of energy detector on mean detection time are also explored."
2894137,21220,8494,A new charge balancing scheme for electrical microstimulators based on modulated anodic stimulation pulse width,2016,"In this Paper, we propose a new method for safe electrical neural stimulation. Current mode digital-to-analog converters are used to generate the cathodic and the anodic stimulation phases. A sample-and-hold and a window comparator circuit are used to compare the voltage of the electrode and the tissue with a target value within a safe voltage range of −50 mV to +50 mV. When the electrode voltage falls below the lower bound or above the upper bound of such a safe voltage range, the anodic stimulation pulse width is modified in such a way that the electrode voltage remains in the safe range. High-level pulse shrinking (HLPS) and low-level pulse shrinking (HLPS) elements are used in digital part to modify anodic pulse width. Simulation results for the proposed circuit implemented in a 0.18μm 1P6M CMOS technology confirm proper functioning and show that the proposed circuit requires extremely low power compared to other charge balancing schemes, with a power consumption of 4.2 μW."

The developed system consists of a mechanism that injects small pulses in the clock signal, and elements that analyze if a fault has been introduced, the number of faults introduced and its position in the inner state. The results obtained demonstrate the vulnerability of these implementations against fault attacks. As far as we know, this is the first time that experimental results of fault attack over Trivium are presented."
2860275,21220,8494,A new countermeasure against scan-based side-channel attacks,2016,"Scan design has been widely used to facilitate the testing of integrated circuits (ICs). However, it also provides attackers a side-channel to access the internal states of crypto chips and thus becomes a great threat to the security of the cipher keys. We propose a secure scan design scheme to protect crypto chips against such scan-based side-channel attacks. In this scheme, we introduce a shift register to control the working mode of certain scan cells. Only when the user configures the shift register correctly, can the scan design work normally under testing mode. We show that the proposed secure scan design can effectively resist the existing scan-based attacks. We also demonstrate that this approach has low area overhead while maintaining the testability of original design."

The GGFST method can directly apply the generalized Foley-Sammon transform (GFST) method that has the best separable ability in a global sense to the high-dimensional augmented Gabor feature vectors derived from the Gabor wavelet representation of face images.

The comparative experiments on the ORL database show that the GGFST method is more effective than the previous methods.

2884553,21220,8494,Ternary max-min algebra for representation of reversible logic functions,2016,"Ternary reversible logic functions are generally represented as ternary Galois field sum of products (TGFSOP) expressions and the TGFSOP expressions are mapped to reversible circuits using cascades of Feynman and Toffoli gates. Although a ternary logic function with a large number of variables can be minimized as a TGFSOP expression, the process is computationally expensive and the resulting reversible circuit tends to have a high quantum cost and ancilla in puts. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose a new method of representing ternary reversible logic functions as Max of Min-terms (Max-Min) expressions, which can be mapped to a reversible circuit using multiple-controlled unary gates requiring lower quantum cost and fewer ancilla inputs. We propose a map-based minimization method for Max-Min expressions of up to four variables focusing on restrictions of the reversible circuit mapping technique."

Unlike many other existing protection schemes, we develop an error-resilient unequal protection (ER-UEP) method that adds redundant information optimally for loss protection and, at the same time, cancels completely the dependency among bitstream after loss recovery. In our ER-UEP method, the FGS enhancement-layer bitstream is first packetized into a group of independent data packets, while each packet can be truncated to represent the original video signal at any fidelity (i.e., scalability). Parity packets are then created with intrinsic UEP capabilities that can easily adapt to the current channel conditions. Unlike conventional UEP schemes that suffer from bitstream contamination due to the dependency among packets, our method guarantees the successful decoding of all received bits, thus leading to a better error resilience as well as higher robustness (under varying and/or unclean channel conditions)."

The recently developed memristor-crossbar-array technology, which is able to efficiently emulate the plasticity of biological synapses and accommodate matrix multiplication, has demonstrated its potential for neuromorphic computing. To facilitate the computation, a high-speed integrate-and-fire circuit (IFC) and a counter were previously developed to efficiently convert the current from the memristor array into rate-coded spikes. However, the linear dynamic range of the circuit, which is limited by its responding speed, is challenged when the input intensity and the conductance of the memristor array are both high simultaneously. In this paper, a novel cyclical sensing scheme is developed that can significantly extend the linear dynamic range of the original IFC. Meanwhile, the power efficiency of the IFC can also be increased. The circuit simulation results indicated that the cyclical sensing IFC was able to efficiently and accurately facilitate the matrix multiplication when it was integrated with a 32×32 memristor crossbar array. With the optimized crossbar array structure and its peripheral circuits, the developed cyclical sensing IFC has shown great promise in accelerating matrix multiplication in spike-based computing systems."

While its advantages of increasing capacity and reducing output power are clear, understanding its SNR requirements in practical cases lacks sufficient theoretical support. This paper computes the relative power levels of the different signal, interference and noise terms in a Massive MIMO system using Maximum-Ratio Transmission (MRT). This brings light on the operational region of the system. The MRT operation is shown to support a maximum number of users, which is function of the selected modulation and coding scheme. The related expression also leads to a bound for other linear precoders. The impact of channel estimation is shown to be related to the number of orthogonal pilot sequences and users. When both are equal it leads to a 3 dB degradation. At system level, this model directly impacts output power requirements and hence system trade-offs when determining the number of antennas to use."

We demonstrated that the decision circuit we built can generate reliable attractor dynamics capable of reproducing both neurophysiological and behavioral observations during decision tasks."
2905802,21220,8494,Synthesis of reversible logic functions using ternary Max-Min algebra,2016,Ternary reversible circuits are normally realized as Toffoli cascades using ternary Galois field sum of products (TGFSOP) expressions. In this work we propose a new method for realization of ternary reversible circuits using ternary Max-Min expressions. The proposed method uses ternary multiple-controlled unary gates to map Max-Min expression into reversible circuit. We also present techniques for realizations of multiple-controlled unary gates using M-S gates at the quantum level. Preliminary results show that the proposed method produces better results than TGFSOP-based method in terms of both quantum cost and ancilla inputs.

2908045,21220,8494,New strategies in removing non-coherency from signals with large distortion to noise ratios,2016,"Signal spectral analysis is a dominating way of characterizing the dynamic performance of analog signals. To perform accurate spectral testing, the IEEE Standard 1241, 1658 and 1057 suggest coherent sampling. Obtaining coherent sampling, especially when signals have large distortion to noise ratios, has been a challenge for many years. With the growing need for Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) circuits for lower test cost, achieving coherent sampling is becoming more and more challenging. For signal analysis, the signals under test don't usually have sufficient purity. On-chip oscillators, such as Wien Bridge oscillators and Ring oscillator don't possess high signal purity. For high speed, low resolution DACs, the output signal purity is also low. In that case, not only fundamental bin will have spectral leakage, harmonic bins will also have spectral leakages, which makes non-coherency harder to remove."

First, the criterion of the noise-to-state stability of random switched systems with state-dependent min-switching is developed by the multiple Lyapunov functions method. Second, the criterion of the noise-to-state stability of random switched systems with time-dependent switching s derived in conjunction with the average dwell-time approach. The theoretical findings are verified by an illustrative example."

These architectures aim at reproducing the learning capabilities of biological networks by emulating the complex dynamics of biological neurons and synapses. However, to maximize the density of these elements in crossbar arrays, learning circuits have often been limited to the implementation of simple spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms. We propose novel hybrid CMOS-memristor circuits that reproduce more effective and realistic plasticity rules which depend on the timing of the pre-synaptic input spike and on the state of the post-synaptic neuron, and which allow the integration of dense crossbar memristor arrays. To implement these plasticity rules in memristor crossbar arrays, the circuits driving the memristors' post-synaptic terminals actively sense the activity on the pre-synaptic terminals to apply the appropriate stimulation waveforms across the memristors. We illustrate the advantages of this scheme by using it to implement a spike-based perceptron plasticity r ule."

As an alternative method, increasing the sensing circuit (SC) area is generally considered because it can reduce the threshold voltage (Vth) variations. However, the increased SC area can adversely reduce the read yield due to the increased load capacitance. The effects of the increased area on read yield can be different according to the SCs because of their own characteristics. In this work, the trends of read yield according to the area are analyzed for two representative SCs, and the areas of two SCs are optimally designed to have high read yield."

2913673,21220,8494,Implementation of switching circuit models as transfer functions,2016,A transfer function is a mathematical function relating the output or response of a system to the input or stimulus. It is a concise mathematical model representing the input/output behavior of a system and is widely used in many areas of engineering including system theory and signal analysis. Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are a canonical representation of Boolean functions. We implement a framework to build transfer function models of digital switching functions using BDDs and demonstrate their application on simulation and implication.

328276,21220,8494,Optimum multiplicative watermark detector in contourlet domain using the normal inverse Gaussian distribution,2015,"Digital watermarking has been widely used in the copyright protected images in multimedia. This paper addresses the blind watermark detection problem in contourlet domain. It is known that the contourlet coefficients of images have non-Gaussian property and can be well modelled by non-Gaussian distributions such as the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG). In view of this, we exploit this model to derive closed-form expressions for the test statistics and design an optimum blind watermark detector in the contourlet domain. Through conducting several experiments, the performance of the proposed detector is evaluated in terms of the probabilities of detection and false alarm and compared to that of the other existing detectors. It is shown that the proposed detector using the NIG distribution is superior to other detectors in terms of providing higher rate of detection. It is also shown that the proposed NIG-based detector is more robust than other detectors against attacks, such as JPEG compression and Gaussian noise."
318310,21220,8494,Image denoising utilizing the scale-dependency in the contourlet domain,2015,"A new contourlet-based method is introduced for reducing noise in images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. This method takes into account the statistical dependencies among the contourlet coefficients of different scales. In view of this, a non-Gaussian multivariate distribution is proposed to capture the across-scale dependencies of the contourlet coefficients. This model is then exploited in a Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator to restore the clean coefficients by deriving an efficient closed-form shrinkage function. Experimental results are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed denoising method using typical noise-free images contaminated by simulated noise. The results show that the proposed method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the subjective and objective criteria."
2498982,21220,9078,A New Contourlet Transform with Sharp Frequency Localization,2006,"The contourlet transform was proposed as a directional multiresolution image representation that can efficiently capture and represent singularities along smooth object boundaries in natural images. Its efficient filter bank construction as well as low redundancy make it an attractive computational framework for various image processing applications. However, a major drawback of the original contourlet construction is that its basis images are not localized in the frequency domain. In this paper, we analyze the cause of this problem, and propose a new contourlet construction as a solution. Instead of using the Laplacian pyramid, we employ a new multiscale decomposition defined in the frequency domain. The resulting basis images are sharply localized in the frequency domain and exhibit smoothness along their main ridges in the spatial domain. Numerical experiments on image denoising show that the proposed new contourlet transform can significantly outperform the original transform both in terms of PSNR (by several dB 's) and in visual quality, while with similar computational complexity."

This paper presents a general, flexible computing infrastructure based on free and open-source software components to tackle the problem of quasi-realtime processing of time-sensitive surveillance data. The integration of NIST's SmartFlow system enables the transport of data to a Rocks-based cluster of computers for more CPU-intensive computations.

Conventional solutions use pseudo-RNGs (PRNGs) or piggyback on the on-board sensors to harvest environmental entropy, leaving some security concerns open in either way. A recent trend offers the opportunity to fix this issue. In fact, the extremely various requirements of the IoT pushes manufacturers to shift the boundaries of programmability, marketing systems on chip that join micro/application processors with reconfigurable logic, routing and analog parts. This enables the development of true-RNGs (TRNGs) library parts that can be dropped in projects as firmware/configware whenever needed. As a demo, the design of a USB TRNG dongle capable of almost 400kbit/s is illustrated on a Cypress PSOC prototyping kit."

To the best of our knowledge our tool is unique in supporting algorithmic joint modeling of hardware and software elements of a SoC (processing and control logic) using popular Python libraries such as SciPy and NumPy following a Matlab-like syntax. The tool also supports C software development and hw/sw co-verification as it automatically compiles and executes the user's C application code for the processor core.

2895709,21220,8494,Wide dynamic range PSD algorithms and their implementation for compressive imaging,2016,"Planned Sensor Distortion (PSD) is a compression method that quantizes shifted signal with low bit depth. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic range loss issue in the PSD algorithm and propose two novel methods to overcome this issue: a blocked PSD, which divides the image into sub-blocks that adapt to pixel values, and an auto-reset PSD, which utilizes Markov property to recover a high dynamic range image from the modulo image. Simulation on a 3-bit depth image of indoor environment shows PSNR of 35.7dB and 35.0dB respectively after reconstruction using our algorithms. Thereafter, two different implementations for PSD are proposed, introducing shifts at either reset phase or readout phase. These circuits are then extended to be compatible with our proposed algorithms. Finally, simulation results using 0.18um GlobalFoundries process validate our designs. Spontaneous power optimization of ADC and transmission, hardware friendly feature, and the ability of high quality imaging make our compression method promising."
2867123,21220,8494,IIR digital filter design by partial second-order factorization and iterative WLS approach,2016,"In this paper, a novel algorithm is developed for the minimax design of IIR digital filters. Using a partial second-order factorization (PSOF), the denominator polynomial of an IIR digital filter is decomposed as a cascade of second-order factors (SOFs) and a single higher-order factor (HOF). This is inspired by the fact that, when some poles are closer to the boundary of the stability domain, the other poles tend to stay inside the stability domain such that the specified frequency response can be best approximated. By means of the PSOF, stability constraints are only imposed on a limited number of SOFs and, thus, a better design could be attained. The proposed algorithm successively updates SOFs and HOF. To further reduce its computational complexity, the iterative weighted least-squares approach is applied to optimize each SOF or HOF. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can attain the balance between computational efficiency and design accuracy."

To minimize the power consumption, metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitors are generally used in SAR ADCs. In these ADCs, the parasitic capacitance from routing metals affect significantly to the ADC linearity. In this paper, this effect is analyzed systematically. This paper also introduces the design of a new on-chip calibration technique to compensate the parasitic capacitance robustly. The design is implemented in silicon using a 65nm CMOS process. Simulation shows that the designed 3.125MS/s 12bit SAR ADC can achieve 10.8bit ENOB (effective number of bits) reliably with this para-C calibration technique with a significant variation of the routing parasitics. Before calibration, the ADC achieves 8.7bit ENOB, which is mainly due to the poor linearity. With proper split of the capacitor array, the technique needs little calibration overhead."

920117,21220,8494,Investigation of characteristics of tungsten oxide with different work pressures in photoelectrochromic cell,2012,"In this study, the tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) electrochromic layer of photoelectrochromic cell (PECC) was fabricated on an indium tin oxide/polyethylene terephthalare (ITO/PET) flexible substrate at room temperature by R.F. sputtering. The photoelectrode of PECC was prepared by screen printing technique. In order to fabricate transparent tungsten oxide thin films, a different work pressures was set from 10 mTorr to 50 mTorr in the process. The optical properties of these thin films were measured by Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer. The transmittance of tungsten oxide thin films increases with increasing work pressure. The thin film which was deposited at 10 mTorr shows dark blue and has low transmittance, light blue film was deposited at 20 mTorr, and the transparent films were deposited above 30 mTorr. The optimum pressure was 30 mTorr because the resistivity of thin films was smaller than 40 mTorr and 50 mTorr. It is observed that the optical band gap energy of thin films increases with increasing work pressure. Thus, the WO 3  thin film which was deposited at 30 mTorr was chosen and applied to PECC, and then the transmittance of PECC was decreased to 13.1 % for 30 seconds at near infrared range under illumination. In addition, the transmittance variation (ΔT%) and the optical density change (ΔOD) were 52.6 % and 0.70, respectively."

297797,21220,8494,Fast-polarization-hopping transmit-diversity to mitigate prolonged deep fades,2003,"Fast-polarization-hopping (FPH) transmission-diversity is herein proposed to mitigate prolonged deep-fades at the mobile receiver, e.g., in the indoor propagation environment. Even if the individual multipaths are each sufficiently strong for detection, deep fades may occur due to destructive summation at the receiver. Relative immobility, in indoor communications' of the transmitter and the propagation environment and the receiver, means any deep-fade may last for a very long duration, dropping calls or severing links. By fast-hopping of the transmission-polarization (say, alternating transmission from a vertically polarized dipole-antenna and from a horizontally polarized dipole-antenna - or an X oriented dipole pair), the effective propagation-channel becomes diversified among a rapid succession of summation possibilities within the channel-coder's interleaving-depth, without any mechanical movement of the transmitting antennas and without any change to the receiving handset. This scheme, within certain to-be-discussed limits, also produces no transmission bandwidth spreading and is compatible to any signaling scheme or transmission standards. The proposed scheme's efficacy is verified by computer simulations using CINDOOR, a polarization-sensitive indoor wireless-propagation simulation software using ray-tracing."

2824524,21220,8494,Low overhead in situ aging monitoring and proactive aging management,2016,"Post-Dennard scaling CMOS technologies suffer from considerable degradation due to increasing electrical fields caused by the lack of further reduction of the supply voltage. This aspect of aging is widely disregarded so far and cannot be addressed at design time by adding static margins anymore. Instead, it needs to be counteracted effectively at run time over the entire device lifetime. For this purpose, dynamic runtime approaches for aging management are required, relying on detailed in formation regarding the current system state. In this paper we propose a novel aging monitoring mechanism providing that crucial information at a marginal resource overhead. The current device degradation is measured via the aging-dependent delay variation, which can be quantified in situ with built-in tests exploiting the strictly monotonic relation between supply voltage and propagation delay. Furthermore, we suggest to utilize the information gained this way for a proactive aging-aware task mapping."

Location-dependent processing occurs in multiple dendritic compartments, where sparse binary synapses are formed by utilizing structural plasticity rule. This rule is a correlation-based learning scheme inspired by the Tempotron learning rule to form synaptic connections on the dendritic compartments. The performance of the model is compared with a lumped dendrite model as well as with other classifiers for spatiotemporal spike patterns. The results indicate that our biologically realistic multicompartment model using low resolution weights achieves about 4–5% higher accuracy than the lumped scheme and about 2% less accuracy than the Tempotron using high resolution weights, while with 4bit weights the Tempotron accuracy drops by 5% of our proposed method."

521596,21220,8494,Successive cancellation decoding of polar codes using stochastic computing,2015,"Polar codes have emerged as the most favorable channel codes for their unique capacity-achieving property. To date, numerous approaches for efficient decoding of polar codes have been reported. However, these prior efforts focused on design of polar decoders via deterministic computation, while the behavior of stochastic polar decoder, which can have potential advantages such as low complexity and strong error-resilience, has not been studied in existing literatures. This paper, for the first time, investigates polar decoding using stochastic logic. Specifically, the commonly-used successive cancellation (SC) algorithm is reformulated into the stochastic form. Several methods that can potentially improve decoding performance are discussed and analyzed. Simulation results show that a stochastic SC decoder can achieve similar error-correcting performance as its deterministic counterpart. This work can pave the way for future hardware design of stochastic polar codes decoders."
2839093,21220,8494,On the potential of correlated materials in the design of spin-based cross-point memories (Invited),2016,"Cross-point architectures are promising for designing dense memory arrays. However, sneak current paths in a cross-point array necessitates the use of non-linear selectors. In this paper, we analyze the potential of employing correlated materials exhibiting abrupt insulator-metal transitions as selectors to design cross-point memories based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We analyze the properties of the correlated materials and co-design MTJs and the selector to optimize the energy efficiency and robustness of the memory array. Our analysis points to the need of a correlated material with a large ratio of insulator and metal resistivities along with appropriate critical currents for the phase transitions (the values of which depend on the absolute value of the resistivities). We discuss that the design constraints lead to a restriction on the range of the selector length, which is closely related to the oxide thickness of the MTJ. Comparison of the cross-point architecture with standard architecture shows the benefits in the former in terms of 7% larger sense margin and 5X higher integration density at iso-read stability. However, this comes at the cost of 2X lower write speed (due to two-cycle write) and 11%–19% increase in the read/write power (due to sneak current in the cross-point array)."

However, the training of such deep network is non-trivial due to the over-fitting problem caused by the insufficient training data and the diminishing gradients problem occurred in the back-propagation. To address these problems, we propose a multi-task learning framework with supervised neural networks to jointly detect facial landmarks with a set of related tasks. On the one hand, to handle the over-fitting problem, the proposed method takes the advantage of additional task labels to train the model in a multi-task learning fashion to generate a shared feature representation for high-level recognition tasks. On the other hand, in order to tackle the transparency and diminishing gradients problem, the proposed method enforces supervision to the intermediate layers of the network, augmenting the gradient signal propagated from the final layer. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, the process of commercialization of STT-MRAM is hampered by its poor reliability. Generally, these reliability issues are caused by the PVT (Process Variations, Voltage, and Temperature) of both MTJ (Magnetic Tunneling Junction) and transistor. Mitigation and alleviating the impacts of the intrinsic properties and PVT on STT-MRAM is a challenging work. This paper discusses the errors occurring in STT-MRAM resulting from its poor reliability, and analyzes the causes of such errors. To obtain a quantitative assessment of PVT impact on STT-MRAM reliability, we investigate three aspects: writing/reading operation error rate, power consumption and access delay of a single cell.

2881196,21220,8494,Optimal filter design for signal estimation based on linear time-variant system theory,2016,"Optimal Wiener filtering is a popular method for the estimation of stationary processes which can be completely derived system-theoretically. Although there exist several optimal filtering concepts for non-stationary processes, there is still a lack of fundamental time-variant system theory that describes the problem statement for non-stationary process estimation. This paper provides an intuitively understandable theory for the fundamental optimal filtering concept. By interpreting cross- and autocorrelations as a time-variant impulse response of a linear system, the problem statement can be illustrated with a network of linear systems. This paper introduces a double periodic system model that approximates a time-variant transfer function in both time and frequency domain which leads to an analytic solution for the optimal time-variant filter. The presented results are generally applicable and degenerate for simplified process properties (e.g. stationarity) to the well known results. We also present how the problem statement can easily be extended due to the fundamental and uniform theoretical approach."

1027582,21220,8494,A constructive approach for threshold logic circuit synthesis,2014,"Abstract – In this paper, a novel method to synthesize circuits based on threshold logic gates (TLG) is proposed. Synthesis considering TLGs is quite relevant, since threshold logic has been revisited as a promising alternative to conventional CMOS integrated circuits due to its suitability to emerging technologies, such as tunneling diodes, memristors and spintronics devices. A constructive process is applied to generate optimized TLG networks taking into account multiple goals and design costs, including gate count, logic depth and number of interconnections. Experiments carried out over MCNC benchmark circuits have shown an average gate count reduction of circa 32%, reaching up to 54% in some cases, in comparison to related approaches. Keywords – Digital circuit, logic synthesis, threshold logic, functional composition, threshold networks, TLG. I. I NTRODUCTION The limits of MOS transistor scaling have motivated investigations about new alternative devices, such as spintronics, resonant tunneling devices (RTD), quantum cellular automata (QCA), single electron transistor (SET) and memristors [1]-[3]. In this new scenario, it has been verified that threshold logic gates (TLG) are more suitable to implement digital integrated circuits (ICs) based on these new technologies, differently from the standard AND/OR based CMOS circuit design [4][5]. However, specific CAD tools must be available for developing TLG based ICs. In this sense, one critical task is to obtain efficient network built using TLGs to implement a specific Boolean function. In [5], Zhang et al. proposed a recursive partition of a logic function that is not threshold and merge nodes respecting fan-in restrictions. Unfortunately, the quality of results is very sensitive to the initial Boolean network. On the other hand, the method presented by Subirats et al., in [6], is based on the truth table description of the function. The algorithm compute an ordering of variables using information of on-set and off-set, performing Shannon decomposition up to find threshold logic functions (TLF). However, this approach provides as output a two-level threshold network, without fan-in restriction, being more suitable for neural networks than for IC design. In [7], Gowda et al. used a factorized tree to generate a network of threshold gates. The method recursively breaks the given initial expression tree into sub expressions, identifying sub-tree that are TLFs and assigning the input weights. It is appropriate for IC synthesis using several TLGs, but represents a very time consuming process and presents a strong dependence to the initial expression structure, including the ordering of the initial tree. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to synthesize threshold networks aiming to (1) minimize threshold networks taking into account other costs besides threshold gate count, like logic depth and number of interconnections, (2) generate more than one effective solution, considering a design cost order, and (3) eliminate the structural bias dependence in order to improve the quality of results. It is based on a constructive synthesis [8]-[10], which associates simpler sub-solutions with known costs in order to build more complex networks, allowing the optimization of different cost functions other than just the TLG count. The algorithm uses a novel AND/OR association between threshold networks to reduce the total number of TLGs in the circuit. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, some fundamentals are briefly presented for a better understanding of our approach. Section III describes the algorithm proposed to synthesize threshold logic networks. Section IV provides the experimental results, whereas the conclusions are outlined in Section V. II. P"
1142670,21220,8494,A hybrid analog/digital Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity learning circuit for neuromorphic VLSI multi-neuron architectures,2014,"To endow large scale VLSI networks of spiking neurons with learning abilities it is important to develop compact and low power circuits that implement synaptic plasticity mech- anisms. In this paper we present an analog/digital Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) circuit that changes its internal state in a continuous analog way on short biologically plausible time scales and drives its weight to one of two possible bi-stable states on long time scales. We highlight the differences and improvements over previously proposed circuits and demonstrate the performance of the new circuit using data measured from a chip fabricated using a standard 180nm CMOS process. Finally we discuss the use of stochastic learning methods that can best exploit the properties of this circuit for implementing robust machine-learning algorithms. I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been a proliferation of custom VLSI implementations of computing architectures based on spiking neural networks (1)-(6). These architectures compute in a distributed fashion that is massively parallel and fault tol- erant and they can potentially have very low power consump- tion. Therefore, they are being explored as possible alternative solutions to conventional digital computing approaches. The programming model for these networks, however, is radi- cally different from the conventional von Neumann sequence of instructions model. The knowledge, or the program, in a neural network is encoded in the network architecture, and in the weights of the connections between the neurons. New theories and methods are being developed for understanding how to synthesize pre-specified computing algorithms on these hardware systems through defining appropriate network archi- tectures and connectivity patterns (7), (8). However, to endow these architectures with adaptation and learning mechanisms that change their synaptic weights on-line (e.g., to realize the intended functionality autonomously) it is necessary to develop appropriate compact and low-power plasticity circuits that are compatible with the VLSI architectures being developed. Furthermore, to allow these hardware neuromorphic systems to interact with the user and the environment (e.g., in the field of robotics or neuroprosthetics), it is important that these circuits can exhibit dynamics with biologically plausible time constants. In this paper, we describe a hybrid analog/digital weight- update circuit that can be biased to operate with such time constants. The circuit can be used in a wide variety of spike- based learning protocols and is optimized for minimum size and power-consumption. As the circuit updates its internal state variable when it is stimulated by input digital pulses, it is ideally suited to implement Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning algorithms. The synapse circuit updates its state in an analog way, continuously over time, but it settles to one of two possible states on long-time scales. This enables the design of an extremely compact and low-power circuit that is robust to noise in both the circuit and the input signals. We describe the circuit in the next section. In Section III we demonstrate its properties with experimental results measured from a recent 180 nm CMOS design. In Section IV we present our conclusions and discuss the advantages of binary synapses and show how they can be used for learning uncorrelated pat- terns and for implementing classical neural network learning algorithms.

1817095,21220,8494,Linear programming design of semi-digital FIR filter and ΣΔ modulator for VDSL2 transmitter,2014,"High-speed and high-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are vital components in all telecommunication systems. Radio-frequency digital-to-analog converter (RFDAC) provides high-speed and high-resolution conversion from digital domain to an analog signal. RFDACs can be employed in direct-conversion radio transmitter architectures. The idea of RFDAC is to utilize an oscillatory pulse-amplitude modulation instead of the conventional zero-order hold pulse amplitude modulation, which results in DAC output spectrum to have high energy high-frequency lobe, other than the Nyquist main lobe. The frequency of the oscillatory pulse can be chosen, with respect to the sample frequency, such that the aliasing images of the signal at integer multiples of the sample frequency are landed in the high-energy high-frequency lobes of the DAC frequency response. Therefore the high-frequency images of the signal can be used as the output of the DAC, i.e., no need to the mixing stage for frequency up-conversion after the DAC in the radio transmitter. The mixing stage however is not eliminated but it is rather moved into the DAC elements and therefore the local oscillator (LO) signal with high frequency should be delivered to each individual DAC element.In direct-conversion architecture of IQ modulators which utilize the RFDAC technique, however, there is a problem of finite image rejection. The origin of this problem is the different polarity of the spectral response of the oscillatory pulse-amplitude modulation in I and Q branches. The conditions where this problem can be alleviated in IQ modulator employing RFDACs is also discussed in this work.ΣΔ modulators are used preceding the DAC in the transmitter chain to reduce the digital signal’s number of bits, still maintain the same resolution. By utilizing the ΣΔ modulator now the total number of DAC elements has decreased and therefore the delivery of the high-frequency LO signal to each DAC element is practical. One of the costs of employing ΣΔ modulator, however, is a higher quantization noise power at the output of the DAC. The quantization noise is ideally spectrally shaped to out-of-band frequencies by the ΣΔ modulator. The shaped noise which usually has comparatively high power must be filtered out to fulfill the radio transmission spectral mask requirement.Semi-digital FIR filter can be used in the context of digital-to-analog conversion, cascaded with ΣΔ modulator to filter the out-of-band noise by the modulator. In the same time it converts the signal from digital domain to an analog quantity. In general case, we can have a multi-bit, semi-digital FIR filter where each tap of the filter is realized with a sub-DAC of M bits. The delay elements are also realized with M-bit shift registers. If the output of the modulator is given by a single bit, the semi-digital FIR filter taps are simply controlled by a single switch assuming a current-steering architecture DAC. One of the major advantages is that the static linearity of the DAC is optimum. Since there are only two output levels available in the DAC, the static transfer function, regardless of the mismatch errors, is always given by a straight line.In this work, the design of SDFIR filter is done through an optimization procedure where the ΣΔ noise transfer function is also taken into account. Different constraints are defined for different applications in formulation of the SDFIR optimization problem. For a given radio transmitter application the objective function can be defined as, e.g., the hardware cost for SDFIR implementation while the constraint can be set to fulfill the radio transmitter spectral emission mask."

The continuous-time (CT) 2 nd order modulator is realized using a passive ﬁlter topology. Inorder to obtain a small area, all capacitors are realized usingparallel compensated depletion-mode MOSCAPs. To maximizethe performance, genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to optimizethe circuit for smaller area and higher signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR). In the dynamic comparator, which is theonly active block in the circuit, bulk-driven technique is used toobtain lower supply voltage operation. The circuit was designedin a 130 nm CMOS technology and, using a clock frequency of2 MHz, has a bandwidth of 10 kHz to cover the most common bio-potential signals. The electrical transient noise simulation resultsshow that the circuit achieves a peak SNDR of 58 dB and adynamic range of 64 dB while dissipating only 410 nW, whichcorresponds to an energy efﬁciency of 32 fJ/conv.-step. I. I NTRODUCTION In electronic medical devices, power consumption is crit-ical, normally to the limited longevity of portable batteries.Due to restriction of limited batteries life, analog-to-digitalconverters (ADCs) become very challenging to design withreasonable performance and considering the bandwidth of themost common bio-potential signals, which ranges from neardc to about 10 kHz, as illustrated in Fig. 1 [1].Sigma-Delta modulators (Ms) have been intensivelyinvestigated for biomedical applications [1]–[3] and also forlow voltage operation [4], [5]. In [2], the authors present astudy of discrete-time (DT) Ms for low power applications,where one of the modulators uses a DT passive loop-ﬁlterand achieves a reasonable performance with a very low powerconsumption. Nevertheless, the approach use large capacitorsto implement the DT loop-ﬁlter and consequently leads to alarge area. A low voltage and low power active DT M forbiomedical sensors is discussed in [3]. The design approachrelies on the bulk-driven technique at the input differentialpair of the transconductance ampliﬁer to enable a wider inputrange. However, the performance in terms of SNDR anddynamic range (DR) is poor. Targeting a very low voltageoperation, a DT M is discussed in [4]. For that, the am-pliﬁers are implemented using near-threshold-voltage biasedinverters with a good overall performance. Despite of the lowervoltage operation, the circuit consumes a considerable current.Several other solutions that use Ms, to improve the powerdissipation are discussed in [6], but they are implemented for"

This paper focuses on IR video data processing of recorded birds'/bats' activities during nocturnal migration. A IR video processing algorithm has been developed for this application. The goal of this work is to show trajectories of flying birds'/bats', compute passage rates, total numbers, direction of flight, object size, heat, velocity, and straightness index. This information will then help and guide the mitigation process which may reduce unwanted effects on birds/bats. The IR video data in this project is recorded by FLIR SR- 19 camera. This IR camera system has standard resolution Focal Plane Array (FPA) of 320(H) ×240(V) pixels and Field of View (FOV) of 36˚. The detector frame rate is 30 frames/second. The FLIR SR-19 thermal camera was deployed along with marine radar and acoustic recorders for both birds and bats at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge in the western basin of Lake Erie, Ohio during 2011 spring bird migration period. This area has been sighted for development of potential on-shore and off-shore wind farms due to availability of high winds. The data was collected from three different sources (IR camera, marine radar and acoustic recorders) continuously starting in one hour after the sunset to one hour before the sunrise. In this case, there are 63000 frames in 1 GB data. Since the total size of data for one season is approximately 205 GB, there are 12,915,000 frames that need to be processed. Data was recorded from April 13t h"
694543,21220,8494,A high-voltage-tolerant stimulator realized in the low-voltage CMOS process for cochlear implant,2014,"A biomedical stimulator with four high-voltage- tolerant output channels, combined with on-chip positive high voltage generator, is proposed. For the purpose of integration with other circuit blocks into a system-on-chip (SoC) for cochlear implant biomedical applications, this design has been realized with the 1.8-V/3.3-V transistors in a 0.18-µm CMOS process. This stimulator only needs one single supply voltage of 1.8 V, but the maximum stimulation voltage can be as high as 7 V. The dynamic bias technique and stacked MOS configuration are used to implement this stimulator in the low-voltage CMOS process, without causing the issues of electrical overstress and gate-oxide reliability during circuit operation. I. INTRODUCTION System-on-chips (SoC) for medical applications, such as retinal prosthesis (1) and epileptic seizure controller (2), had been proposed to implant into human body. The cochlear implant system is also one kind of medical applications for the profound deafness (3). Cochlear implant system is based on stimulating surviving auditory nerve in the inner ear to restore the hearing of deaf persons (4). The cochlear implant SoC for implanting into the human ear is illustrated in Fig. 1. The output from the stimulator is requested to provide adjustable high voltage to the electrodes those are implanted into the cochlea. The stimulator of the cochlear implant system may have a single channel or multiple channels, monopolar or bipolar stimulation, monophasic or biphasic pulse, and constant-current mode or constant-voltage mode (1), (5). The well-developed CMOS processes had been attractive to realize the implantable device for biomedical electronic applications. When the operation voltage of the stimulator is higher than the device normal operating voltage of a low-voltage CMOS process, the stimulator was usually implemented in the high- voltage CMOS process (6). From the biomedical application in our cochlear implant project, a stimulator with four-channel outputs in bipolar fashion, biphasic pulse, and constant-voltage mode is requested. According to the request of our biomedical project for cochlear implant, the required maximum voltage for stimulation is as high as 7 V. For SoC integration purpose, the other circuit blocks including data converter, DSP processor, and filters in the implant SoC device are all designed and realized in low-voltage CMOS process to reduce power consumption. So, the stimulator combined with high voltage generator implemented in low-voltage CMOS process is needed (7). Before any human test, the animal test to verify the function of SoC chip should be performed in advance. To design a power efficient output stage, the loading impedance of the specified biomedical application should be investigated first. So, the impedance of the cochlea of guinea pig was measured with the implanted electrodes, as that shown in Fig. 2(a). According to the measured impedance, the circuit model of the implanted electrodes with the cochlea has been calculated as that shown in Fig. 2(b). In this work, the stimulator with four-channel outputs is developed to drive the cochlea via the implanted electrodes, and it is implemented in a 0.18-µm 1.8-V/3.3-V CMOS process."
2255429,21220,8494,Optimal coil size ratios for wireless power transfer applications,2014,"Optimization of coil sizes for wireless power transfer applications has a significant impact on the range and efficiency of the wireless power system. Often it is difficult to accurately analyze how a set of coils will perform before they are constructed due to the complexity of approximating the parasitic components and coupling coefficients associated with the coils. Also, for certain wireless power applications such as consumer electronic devices, implanted medical devices and industrial equipment that have physical constraints on the size and shape of the coils, it can be a difficult and time-consuming process to design and evaluate several different coil configurations for optimal range and efficiency. This paper provides simplified design equations to accurately calculate the self inductance, capacitance, resistance, quality factor and coupling coefficient in terms of coil geometries for flat, spiral coils. Experimental results validate the analysis and a design example is provided to optimize the size of a transmit coil for maximum range and wireless power efficiency to a 5.8cm receive coil used in a four-element wireless power transfer system. I. INTRODUCTION The growing number of wireless power transfer (WPT) applications demand highly efficient WPT at ranges well beyond those of commercially available wireless charging pads, which require physical contact between the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) coil. The successful implementation of contactless wireless power hinges on convenience for the user and compliance with safety and regulatory standards. Maximizing WPT efficiency enables lower transmitted power, thereby decreasing the field strength of emissions, maintaining low coil temperatures, and facilitating regulatory compliance for any application. Two critical parameters for long range and highly efficient WPT between two coils are the quality factor Q for each coil and the coupling coefficient k between the coils. High Q and stronger k between two coils results in greater efficiency at a longer WPT range (1). However, high Q does not necessarily imply high k, especially if the Tx and Rx coils are not equally sized. The size and geometry of the Tx and Rx coils significantly impact both Q and k independently. In this work, a flat, spiral multi-turn coil topology is considered due to the wide range of applications that can physically accommodate such a coil. Extensive prior work has provided expressions for the inductance L, resistance R, and capacitanceC for lumped modeling of flat spiral coils in terms of the coil geometry (2), (3), (4), and outlined optimization techniques for coil design using Litz wire to minimize the skin effect (5) and for biomedical applications (6). However, these expressions and techniques are typically complex, computa- tionally intensive, and can be inaccurate for a wide range of coil sizes and operating frequencies. Other work has shown how to calculate the coupling coefficient between two flat spiral coils (7). However few articles demonstrate the effects that the coil size has on both Q and k, and the overall impact on WPT range and efficiency. In this work, we provide simplified expressions for Q and k in terms of the coil geometry for a flat, spiral coil. We exper- imentally validate these expressions and prove their accuracy under certain geometric constraints. Using these expressions, we determine the optimal ratio of the transmit coil outer diameter to receive coil outer diameter D O;TX DO;RX that results in the highest efficiency at the longest range. We provide an example that uses this technique to design Tx and Rx coils that maximize efficiency across a targeted distance range for the desired application given only the maximum allowable size of each coil."
887286,21220,8494,Segmentation-based scale-invariant nonlocal means super resolution,2014,"Zooming in/out appears frequently in video shoot- ing, which makes scale vary between frames. And object motion in videos may cause scale change of the object. It leads to the difficulty in finding similar patches and causes the invalidation of nonlocal means super resolution (NLM SR). In this paper, we propose a novel scale-compensated NLM SR algorithm. First, by considering the parameter model, the image is segmented in order to detect regions with different scales. Then, scale variations in different regions are computed based on SIFT descriptor. And patches extracted from different regions are compensated into the same scale to eliminate the effect of scale change. It is shown by experimental results that our proposed algorithm achieves the average PSNR by up to 0.678dB comparing with the state- of-the-art methods. Subjective results demonstrate the proposed method reduces artifacts and preserves more details. I. INTRODUCTION Multi-frame super resolution (SR) methods reconstruct a high resolution (HR) frame from multiple low resolution (LR) frames. They are based on the assumption that LR frames can complement each other by a large amount of redundant information. Motion estimation techniques are employed in SR to obtain redundant information. However, due to the complex- ity of motion, unavoidable motion estimation error leads to annoying artifacts in super resolved HR frame. To avoid this problem, Potter et al. (1) proposed a motion-estimation-free algorithm based on NLM. NLM SR takes the advantage of the redundancy of patches existing in images. It obtains a better HR image with no explicit motion estimation by replacing every pixel with a weighted average of its neighborhood. In the past decade, researchers made progress in NLM SR by improving patch matching and exploiting more information. Some suggest adaptively choosing parameters. The adaptive choice of parameters for NLM SR relates to the size of the patch and search window. The proper size of the patch and search window can help us find more accurate patches to improve the performance of NLM. Cheng et al. (2) proposed using mobilized search window and adaptive patch size. But the method of mobilizing search window is based on pixel and might fall to a local optimal solution easily. Some develop a new way of calculating similarities to use more available information. Patches which better represent the image char- acteristics are captured and thus the efficiency of matching those patches is improved. Grewening et al. (3) proposed"
1611018,21220,8494,Spin-transfer torque magnetic memory as a stochastic memristive synapse,2014,"Abstract — Spin-transfer torque magnetic memory (STT-MRAM) is currently under intense academic and industrial development, since it features nonvolatility, high write and read speed and high endurance. In this work, we show that when used in an original regime, it can additionally act as a stochastic memristive device, appropriate to implement a “synaptic” function. We introduce basic concepts relating to STT-MRAM cell behavior and its possible use to implement learning-capable synapses. System-level simulations on a problem of car counting highlight the potential of the technology for learning systems. Monte Carlo simulations show its robustness to device variations. These results open the way for unexplored applications of STT-MRAM in robust, low power, cognitive-type systems. Keywords: STT-MRAM, neuromorphic, memristor, stochastic computation. I. I NTRODUCTION Thanks to considerable progress in recent years, spin-transfer torque magnetic memory (STT-MRAM) – the second generation of magnetic memory – now appears as a breakthrough for embedded and standalone non-volatile memory, providing fast programming and high endurance [1]. However, a limitation of this technology is its stochastic switching nature [1]–[3]. The time required for programming from a memory state to another is a random quantity, which requires designing programming times magneticwith high security margins, to ensure reliable programming. Device physicists have intensely studied this effect of intrinsic probability [4], [5], and circuit designers have proposed ideas like self-enabled programming to mitigate the issue [2]. However, an alternative approach is to not consider this randomness as a drawback, but as a feature of the device. In particular, here we reinterpret STT-MRAM cell’s behavior as a “stochastic memristive device”. And we show by system-level simulations how it may be used in a neuromorphic system for real life applications. In recent years, the exploitation of nanodevices with memory effects (or memristive devices) as synapses in neuromorphic systems has stimulated a growing interest [6]–[17]. They raise the hope for a breakthrough in electronics, bringing smarter, lower power and more adaptive systems. Most of these proposals use memory devices with multi-level capability – the original memristor paradigm [8]. However, an alternative idea is to use binary devices programmed in a"
2488330,21220,8494,"An On-line, Multi-Parametric, Multi-Channel Physicochemical Monitoring Platform for Stem Cell Culture Bioprocessing",2007,"This paper describes the development of a novel physiological platform aiming at the on-line, in-situ, multi-parametric, multi-channel, physicochemical, spatiotemporal monitoring of stem cell cultures. The three main operational components are: a) miniaturized electro-chemical (bio)sensors; b) real-time data acquisition system tailored to the sensor interfacing requirements and c) the bioreactor within which the stem cells are growing. It is believed that the totality of the platform constitutes a novel technological modality for the bioprocess engineer and can contribute to the harnessing of the potential of stem cells by enabling and/or facilitating the identification and classification of their proliferation and differentiation paths. This paper places emphasis upon the electronic hardware and software parts of the proposed intelligent stem cell culture systems (ISCCS). The hardware of the measurement system is organized into three types of modules each capable of 16-channel realtime data acquisition. The three types of modules correspond to potentiometric, amperometric and ohmic types of sensors. The platform can support an arbitrary combination of such modules up to the number of eight, thus enabling the realization of a flexible and versatile system capable of providing up to 128 data acquisition channels for the physiological monitoring of the stem cell culture process. In other words, the measurement equipment can be configured to interface with up to eight different types of sensors each sensor monitoring a physiological quantity of relevance (e.g. glucose, lactate, ammonia, oxygen, pH etc.) each quantity measured concurrently by 16 on-line channels over the space occupied by the cell culture in the bioreactor (spatiotemporal physiological monitoring). The whole measurement system is PC-based with its application software developed in Lab VIEW since it provides a friendly user interface for hardware configuration and setting measurement parameter while at the same time facilitating the acquisition, display and management of different types of sensed data in real-time. Both the hardware and software aspects of the new measurement system are elaborated in this paper. Other aspects of the ISCCS platform relating to both the sensors and the bioreactor are also discussed. Moreover results are reported and the whole system is illustrated in detail."
912615,21220,8494,A Slope-Based Multipath Estimation technique for mitigating short-delay multipath in GNSS receivers,2010,"The everlasting public interest on location and positioning services has originated a demand for a high performance Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System or the future European satellite navigation system, Galileo. The performance of GNSS is subject to several errors, such as ionosphere delay, troposphere delay, receiver noise and multipath. Among all these errors, multipath is the main limiting factor in precision-oriented GNSS applications. In order to mitigate the multipath influence on navigation receivers, the multipath problem has been approached from several directions, including the development of novel signal processing techniques. Many of these techniques rely on modifying the tracking loop discriminator in order to make it resistant to multipath. These techniques have proved very efficient against multipath having a medium or large delay with respect to the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal. In general, the multipath errors are largely reduced for multipath delays greater than around 0.1 chips (which is about 29.3 meters for Galileo E1 Open Service (OS) signal). Theoretically, this constitutes a remarkable improvement as compared to simpler techniques such as narrow Early-Minus-Late (nEML) tracking loop. However, in practice, most of the multipath signals enter the receiver with short-delay with respect to LOS signal, making most of these mitigation techniques partially ineffective. In this paper, we propose a new multipath estimation technique, namely the Slope-Based Multipath Estimation (SBME), which is capable of mitigating the short-delay multipath (i.e., multipath delays less than 0.35 chips) quite well compared with other state-of-the-art mitigation techniques, such as the nEML and the High Resolution Correlators (HRC). The proposed SBME first derives a multipath estimation equation by utilizing the correlation shape of the ideal normalized correlation function of a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)- or Multiplexed Binary Offset Carrier (MBOC)-modulated signal, which is then used to compensate for the multipath bias of a nEML tracking loop. It is worth to mention here that the SBME requires an additional correlator at the late side of the correlation function, and it is used in-conjunction with a nEML tracking loop. The multipath performance of the above-mentioned mitigation techniques is presented for Galileo E1 OS and GPS L1 C/A signals from theoretical as well as simulation perspective."
2408874,21220,8494,"ATRS: an alternative roadmap for semiconductors, technology evolution and impacts on system architecture",2006,"Summary form only given. The recent evolution of semiconductor technology, in the last decades, brought tremendous improvements in performance increase at decreasing prices, perfectly following the famous Moore's law. Lithography is still improving and allows 0.7/spl times/ linear shrink per technology node. However, many products are hitting the power wall! Silicon is free, but peak power consumption, power density, heat dissipation are preventing a straight usage of the available silicon area. The simple shrink, even if it is a perfect way for cost reduction, does not support power density increase, and is not supported by packaging technology which does not scale as fast as silicon. On the other hand, scaling allows to double transistor count at each node at constant die size: then the challenge for tomorrow consists in improving performance while maintaining a reasonable power consumption. Architects and designers must improve MOPS/Watt. In the old times, VDD was scaled by 0.7, so there was enough room to increase both complexity and clock frequency. This talk presents an alternative roadmap which is proposing a way to maintain power consumption stable (from today and forever): increase complexity as much as allowed by lithography, implementing a lot of parallelism at decreased clock frequency, with a moderate VDD scaling. There is a big impact on parallel architectures, memory hierarchy, and a bigger impact on device characteristics. We'll demonstrate that device performance must be relaxed compared to the ITRS roadmap, allowing to handle the leakage power crisis and to manage the huge problems due to technology variations. Low frequency and/or asynchronous operating modes are seen as mandatory ways for power management."

However, most hardware development of fully integrated, multi-channel wireless neural recorders to-date, is still in the proof-of-concept stage. To be ready for practical use, the trade-offs between performance, power consumption, device size, robustness, and compatibility need to be carefully taken into account. This paper presents an optimized wireless compressed sensing neural signal recording system. The system takes advantages of both custom integrated circuits and universal compatible wireless solutions. The proposed system includes an implantable wireless system-on-chip (SoC) and an external wireless relay. The SoC integrates 16-channel low-noise neural amplifiers, programmable filters and gain stages, a SAR ADC, a real-time compressed sensing module, and a near field wireless power and data transmission link. The external relay integrates a 32 bit low-power microcontroller with Bluetooth 4.0 wireless module, a programming interface, and an inductive charging unit. The SoC achieves high signal recording quality with minimized power consumption, while reducing the risk of infection from through-skin connectors. The external relay maximizes the compatibility and programmability. The proposed compressed sensing module is highly configurable, featuring a SNDR of 9.78 dB with a compression ratio of 8×. The SoC has been fabricated in a 180 nm standard CMOS technology, occupying 2.1 mm    $\times$   0.6 mm silicon area. A pre-implantable system has been assembled to demonstrate the proposed paradigm. The developed system has been successfully used for long-term wireless neural recording in freely behaving rhesus monkey."
2202215,21220,8494,Efficient symbol reliability based decoding for QCNB-LDPC codes,2014,"Abstract —As an extension of binary low-density parity-check(LDPC) codes, non-binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes show signif-icantly better performance when the code length is moderateor small. Recently, enhanced iterative hard reliability based(EIHRB) decoding algorithm is proposed to reduce the com-putation complexity. However, the EIHRB algorithm suffers alot from signiﬁcant performance degradation when the columnweight is small. In this paper, a symbol reliability based (SRB)decoding algorithm, which also performs well when the columnweight is low, is proposed for NB-LDPC decoding to improvethe decoding performance. With the same maximum iterationnumber, around 0.38 dB extra coding gain is achieved. Fur-thermore, the corresponding efﬁcient decoder architecture isproposed. Comparison results have shown that the proposed SRBalgorithm can not only achieve good coding gain, but the costfor hardware implementation is reasonable. I. I NTRODUCTION B INARY low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, redis-covered by Gallager in 1962 [1], have shown great ca-pabilities in approaching Shannon capacity. Non-binay LDPC(NB-LDPC) codes, which can be treated as an extension oftheir binary counterparts in ﬁnite ﬁelds with order higherthan 2, were ﬁrst investigated by Davey and MacKay [2].Having the capabilities of correcting symbol-wise errors, NB-LDPC codes have demonstrated advantages over binary onesin recovering channel impairments [3].

1580809,21220,8494,Effectiveness of artificial neural network with time-varying coupling system,2014,"We have recently proposed a novel neural network structure called an Affordable Neural Network (AfNN), in which affordable neurons of the hidden layer are considered as the elements responsible for the robustness property as is observed in human brain function. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning process of the AfNN to make clear the reason of that the AfNNs can perform well for learning and generalization abilities and operate as usually against damaging neurons. I. INTRODUCTION The mechanisms of many kinds of higher brain functions become clear with the advances in neuroscience technology. Therefore, the studies of bio-inspired artificial neural networks have been extensively reported to realize such intelligence systems applying for the future engineering applications. How- ever, the performance of artificial neural networks still lags behind that of biological networks in many respects. In order to fill the gap between biological neural systems and artificial neural systems, it is important to apply these high functional mechanisms of the human brain to novel artificial neural networks. In our previous work, we have proposed a new network structure of the feedforward neural network with affordable neurons in the hidden layer for Backpropagation (BP) learn- ing (1). We named this network Affordable Neural Network (AfNN). The AfNN was inspired by cell assembly (2)- (5). which is one of explanations of multiple information processing in the brain and an information is represented by a firing space pattern of a group of plural neurons (see Fig 1(a)). In the AfNN, we prepare some extra neurons more than requires in the hidden layer. When the AfNN executes operating, all of the neurons in the hidden layer are not used at every updating. Namely, the AfNN is able to operate with high function by using different neuron patterns in the hidden layer. By computer simulations, the AfNN has been confirmed to gain better performance for the BP learning on both learning ability and generalization ability. On the other hand, am important issue is the understanding how the mammalian brain is affected in its performance by the omnipresent death of their elements in the field of Neuro- science.

697321,21220,8494,Automatic data path extraction in large-scale register-transfer level designs,2014,"Extracting data paths in large-scale register- transfer level designs has important usage in automatic veri- fication of synchronous circuits and synthesis of asynchronous circuits. Current tools rely on users to provide the data/control partition or use state-space analyses to extract data paths. Due to the explosion of state-space, the latter method can be used in only small designs. To resolve this problem, a graphic search and trim method, which can extract data paths in large scale designs, is presented. A design is first translated into a graphic representation, namely a signal-level data flow graph (DFG), to reveal the connections between signals. By estimating the types (control or data) of these connections, a linear search algorithm can then remove all control-related signals in the graph, which effectively produces a DFG with pure data paths. Results show that this method extracts data paths of large scale designs in seconds. I. INTRODUCTION A large-scale digital system can be recognized as a large set of heterogeneous function units dynamically connected, loaded and scheduled by various local and global controllers. These function units and their mutual connections comprise data paths while the resource schedulers, including the local and global controllers, constitute control paths. Data paths are the hardware implementation of the behavioural-level data flow whose correct operation relies on loading them with the right data at the right time, which is scheduled by the control paths. In behavioural-level synthesis, data flows are usually pro- vided by users or extracted from an input design written in behavioural-level (normally sequential) languages. Data path synthesis (1) maps the flows to function units, explores possible parallel operations and sharing resources among non- overlapped operations. After data and control paths are imple- mented into register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions, they are blended with no explicit boundary. As a result, extracting data paths from RTL descriptions is actually a reverse engineering process which recovers the behavioural-level data flow buried in the logical-level implementation."
2045027,21220,8494,Design Exploration of a Thermal Management Unit for Dynamic Control of Temperature-Induced Clock Skew,2007,"Power densities and temperatures in today's high performance circuits have reached alarmingly high levels due to increased scaling in feature sizes. Subsequently, the various techniques used to keep them under control have also created zones of varying temperatures, thus contributing to temperature gradients inside the chip. These gradients have detrimental effects on the delay of wires, as resistance in metals increases with temperature. Clock nets are extremely susceptible to this effect, since they run through the entire chip. Different techniques have been proposed to counter the impact of temperature on clock speed; they range from re-designing the clock network assuming a stationary profile to more adaptive solutions that allow to dynamically compensate the clock skew through replacement of the original buffers with a specially designed counterpart, called tunable delay buffers (TDBs). Dynamic skew management based on TDBs calls for the presence on the chip of a thermal management unit (TMU), whose purpose is that of periodically choosing the actual delay that each TDB must provide in order to achieve skew optimization. Preliminary implementations of such a unit for basic assumptions on the distribution of sensors and their accuracy have indicated negligible impact on the original design. This work aims at exploring in detail several issues related to TMU design, pivoting on the fact that sensor distribution and its accuracy could in fact impact the design in a significant way depending on the design. We provide the results of a careful exploration we have performed on a meaningful case study, quantifying values for area and power consumption."
361009,21220,8494,Adaptive photoreceptor with wide dynamic range,1994,"We describe a photoreceptor circuit that can be used in massively parallel analog VLSI silicon chips, in conjunction with other local circuits, to perform initial analog visual information processing. The receptor provides a continuous-time output that has low gain for static signals (including circuit mismatches), and high gain for transient signals that are centered around the adaptation point. The response is logarithmic, which makes the response to a fixed image contrast invariant to absolute light intensity. The 5-transistor receptor can be fabricated in an area of about 70 /spl mu/m by 70 /spl mu/m in a 2-/spl mu/m single-poly CMOS technology. It has a dynamic range of 1-2 decades at a single adaptation level, and a total dynamic range of more than 6 decades. Several technical improvements in the circuit yield an additional 1-2 decades dynamic range over previous designs without sacrificing signal quality. The lower limit of the dynamic range, defined arbitrarily as the illuminance at which the bandwidth of the receptor is 60 Hz, is at approximately 1 lux, which is the border between rod and cone vision and also the limit of current consumer video cameras. The receptor uses an adaptive element that is resistant to excess minority carrier diffusion. The continuous and logarithmic transduction process makes the bandwidth scale with intensity. As a result, the total AC RMS receptor noise is constant, independent of intensity. The spectral density of the noise is within a factor of two of pure photon shot noise and varies inversely with intensity. The connection between shot and thermal noise in a system governed by Boltzmann statistics is beautifully illustrated. >"
492890,21220,8494,Logic-in-Memory architecture made real,2015,"The current trend for intensive computational architectures is to adopt massive parallelism, with several concurrent tasks performed simultaneously, as done for example in GPUs. This approach has many advantages, such as the reduced design time given by circuit replication and an increasing in computational speed without the need of higher frequency. It has however evidenced an important bottleneck in data exchange between memory and processor. We envisage a revolutionary path for the future relation between memory and logic in parallel processors, where a new type of architecture exploits the principle of caching to the limit. Our Logic-in-Memory (LIM) architecture mixes logic and memory in the same device, removing the bottleneck of other existing parallel solutions. The architecture we propose, here in its preliminary version, has an array organization and each element in the array is based on three blocks: a logic unit for processing, a smart memory block and a routing structure for inter block communication. In this article we show the benefits of this approach with an application example in the image processing field. We can achieve a 4X computational time reduction for an image processing algorithm (Summed Area Table) with respect to the best architecture present in the literature, even with a preliminary and not optimized version. Besides the adoption of massive parallelism to increase performance, new technologies to open the post-CMOS era are explored. Among them NanoMagnet Logic (NML) is particularly interesting for its ability to mix logic and memory in the same device. We present here the preliminary results of the NML implementation of the LIM architecture. We thus demonstrate that it is not only a good solution for a standard CMOS technology but can also exploit the potential of an emerging technology as NML."
2871193,21220,8494,Dynamically reconfigurable system for LVQ-based on-chip learning and recognition,2016,"Artificial neural networks implement a simplified model of the human brain and thus specialize on pattern recognition. As an alternative to conventional single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) solutions with massive parallelism for self-organizing-map (SOM) neural network models, we report resource-efficient hardware architecture for 1-chip implementation of the learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network algorithm, which is a variant of SOM. Dynamic configurability for two operation modes is realized through the same circuitry for recognition based on nearest-neighbor matching and on-chip learning based on error back-propagation. Switching between learning and recognition modes is carried out by a pipeline with multiplexers and parallel p-word input (P-MPPI). The multiplexers enable data-flow-path reconfiguration, resulting in a significant reduction of area and power consumption. Thus, the P-MPPI architecture achieves time-domain multiplexing between operation modes as well as area/energy-efficiency by reusing both memory arrays and arithmetic or logic units. Additionally, high flexibility for feature-vector dimension and reference-vector number allows the implementation of many different applications, including continuously adaptive neural systems, on the same hardware platform. A test chip in TSMC 65 nm CMOS has parallel 32-word inputs, 585 K-bit on-chip memory, and achieves high processing throughput of 76.8 Gbps and low power consumption of 27.92 mW (at 150 MHz, 1.0 V supply voltage)."
2485724,21220,8494,Exploring compiler optimizations for enhancing power gating,2009,"Power gating is a circuit level technique for reducing standby leakage in a circuit block by cutting off paths in it between the supply and the ground. A processor architecture that supports power gating of its resources may provide instructions that activate and deactivate those resources as part of the instruction set architecture level. Adequate compiler support is then required so that the power gating instructions can be inserted into the code to deactivate the resources that remain idle for long periods of time during program execution. However, the resource usage in a program depends on the code generated by the compiler. Thus, the code transformations performed by the compiler has an influence on the power gating opportunities of the processor resources. In this work, we explore target independent compiler optimizations that modify the functional unit usage in the loops of a procedure to enhance the opportunities to deactivate functional units in an embedded processor architecture. The optimizations performed on the code are sparse conditional constant propagation, lazy code motion, weak strength reduction, and operator strength reduction. Insertion of power gating instructions is performed by inspecting the idleness of the units in the regions enclosed within loops. We model the processor architecture with power gating support around an ARM core and use the SUIF framework for compiler support. Finally, we use the Simplescalar-ARM distribution to perform power and performance evaluation with a set of benchmarks from MiBench and MediaBench suites. Experimental results indicate that the integer multiplier in the processor core can be power gated for upto 99% of its idle cycles, for integer benchmarks, and upto 93%, for floating point benchmarks, when all the optimizations are performed. Moreover, the energy due to leakage in the functional units for the code with all the optimizations performed can be upto 51% lower, for integer benchmarks, and upto 21% lower, for floating point benchmarks, than that for the unoptimized code."
1692686,21220,8494,Asynchronous design: an enabler for flexible microelectronics,2006,"Summary form only given. Flexible microelectronics technology featuring low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS) TFT and surface free technology by laser annealing and ablation (SUFTLAR) is expected to become a platform for developing thin, flexible and low-cost display devices. LTPS TFTs are good for realizing large area displays and integrated circuits at lower cost. A drawback of LTPS TFTs, however, is that they have substantial deviations in characteristics, which are caused by deviations mainly in crystal grain size and thickness of silicon-oxide. Until now, these deviations were considered to be beyond the capability of synchronous circuit design, especially for large-scale circuits such as microprocessors driven by global clocking. Since asynchronous circuits are self-timed, they absorb the deviations of device characteristics. Plus they run as faster as possible in event-driven fashion dissipating less power, and remain on standby for quick service. Even with the benefits of asynchronous circuits, it is considered difficult to proceed with circuit design using syntax-directed translation using VLSI programming languages such as CSP, Tangram and OCCAM, syntax of which is far from the standard HDL. The authors then decided to develop Verilog+ that comprises a subset of Verilog HDLR and minimal primitives used for describing the communications between processes. Flexible 8-bit asynchronous microprocessor ACT11 is the first successful instance of asynchronous design using Verilog+ without knowledge of element and wire delay except for datapath."
1593310,21220,8494,A dual-mode weight storage analog neural network platform for on-chip applications,2012,"On-chip trainable neural networks show great promise in enabling various desired features of modern integrated circuits (IC), such as Built-In Self-Test (BIST), security and trust monitoring, self-healing, etc. Cost-efficient implementation of these features imposes strict area and power constraints on the circuits dedicated to neural networks, which, however, should not compromise their ability to learn fast and retain functionality throughout their lifecycle. To this end, we have designed and fabricated a reconfigurable analog neural network (ANN) chip which serves as an expertise acquisition platform for various applications requiring on-chip ANN integration. With this platform, we intend to address the key cost-efficiency issues: a fully analog implementation with strict area and power budgets, a learning ability of the proposed architecture, fast dynamic programming of the weight memory during training, and high precision non-volatile storage of weight coefficients during operation or standby. We explore two learning structures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and an ontogenic neural network with their corresponding training algorithms. The core circuits are biased in weak inversion and make use of the translinear principle for multiplication and non-linear conversion operations. The chip is mounted on a custom PCB and connected to a computer for chip-in-the-loop training. We present measured results of the core circuits and the dual-mode weight memory. The learning ability is evaluated on a 3-input XOR classification task."
1923993,21220,369,Ultra-wideband analog-to-digital conversion via signal expansion,2005,"We consider analog to digital (A/D) conversion, based on the quantization of coefficients obtained via the projection of a continuous time signal over a set of basis functions. The framework presented here for A/D conversion is motivated by the sampling of an input signal in domains which may lead to significantly less demanding A/D conversion characteristics, i.e., lower sampling rates and lower bit resolution requirements. We show that the proposed system efficiently parallelizes the analog to digital converter (ADC), which lowers the sampling rate requirements by increasing the number of basis functions on which the continuous time signal is projected, leading to a tradeoff between sampling rate reduction and system complexity. Additionally, the A/D conversion resolution requirements can be reduced by optimally assigning the available number of bits according to the variance distribution of the coefficients obtained from the signal projection over the new A/D conversion domain. In particular, we study A/D conversion in the frequency domain, where samples of the continuous signal spectrum are taken such that no time aliasing occurs in the discrete time version of the signal. We show that the frequency domain ADC overcomes some of the difficulties encountered in conventional time-domain methods for A/D conversion of signals with very large bandwidths, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. The proposed A/D conversion method is compared with conventional ADCs based on pulse code modulation (PCM). Fundamental figures of merit in A/D conversion and system tradeoffs are discussed for the proposed ADC. The signal-to-noise and distortion ratios of the frequency domain ADC are presented, which quantify the impact of the most critical impairments of the proposed ADC technique. We also consider application to communications receivers, and provide a design example of a multi-carrier UWB receiver."
2146688,21220,8494,A low-complexity high-speed QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers,2009,"QR decomposition (QRD) is an essential signal processing task for many MIMO signal detection schemes. However, decomposition of complex MIMO channel matrices with large dimensions leads to high computational complexity, and hence results in either large core area or low throughput. Moreover, for mobile communication applications that involve fast-varying channels, it is required to perform QR decomposition with low processing latency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid QRD scheme that uses a combination of multi-dimensional Givens rotations, Householder transformations and the conventional two-dimensional (2D) Givens rotations to both reduce the overall computational complexity and achieve higher execution parallelism. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed QRD scheme, a novel pipelined architecture is presented that uses un-rolled pipelined CORDIC processors iteratively to maximize throughput and resource utilization, while minimizing the gate count. The architectures of the main data processing modules, namely the 2D, Householder 3D and 4D/2D configurable pipelined CORDIC processors, are also presented. Synthesis results for a 4×4 MIMO detector in 0.13µm CMOS process indicate that this QRD design computes a 4×4 complex R matrix and four updated 4×1 complex symbol vectors every 40 cycles, at a clock frequency of 270 MHz and requires 36K gates. The proposed design achieves the lowest processing time and the highest throughput reported to-date for the same framework."
400429,21220,8494,Synthesis of current mode building blocks for fuzzy logic control circuits,1994,"Since the introduction of the first digital-based fuzzy logic controller chip, efficient hardware design of fuzzy logic control systems (FLCS) has drawn substantial attention. The interest in fuzzy logic hardware systems is motivated by the desperate need to provide fast fuzzy logic-based systems capable of operating in real time process control conditions. Fuzzy logic hardware implementation problems can be classified into two basic categories: the digital approach and the analog approach. The digital approach was originated by Togai and Watanabe who developed the first digital fuzzy logic-based inference engine chip. However, the digital approach to the fuzzy logic hardware implementation seems to be less efficient in contrast to analog, especially when the complexity and speed of a control problem are crucial. The transformation of a real-world fuzzy data into a binary format requires tremendous processing power that must be provided in the real time. Therefore, the analog solution offers a sufficient strategy to solve fuzzy logic control problems in dedicated hardware. Recently, successful implementation of current mode fuzzy logic controller developed in CMOS technology was reported. This approach starts with the theoretic framework for fuzzy set operations that leads to the coherent representation of the fuzzy inference operations, including fuzzification and defuzzification. The proposed approach, utilizing the control strategy proposed by Mamdani, concentrates on the algebraic correctness and elegance. It is algebraically effective but it lacks the current mode circuit implementation insight. This drawback motivated the presented research. This paper presents a graph-oriented approach to the synthesis of fuzzy logic building blocks. The framework for synthesis of current-mode fuzzy logic circuits is derived and the graph representations of basic building blocks are developed. These blocks comprise the bounded difference circuit, the absolute difference circuit, the minimum circuit, the maximum circuit, and the membership function circuit. Thereafter, the circuit implementations are analyzed and the circuit implementation issues related to the accuracy of the fuzzy operations are discussed. >"
880996,21220,8494,Sigma delta feedback DAC architectures for high accuracy and extremely low charge transfer,2013,"Sigma delta ADCs (SD-ADC) are often the preferred ADCs of choice in sensor interfacing applications due to their high achievable absolute accuracy. Constraints such as low power and limited area often dictate minimum front-end hardware, thereby limiting options for pre-processing stages. Processing very small input signals requires that the magnitudes of the signals at the input summing node match. Given that often the sensor output current is of extremely low magnitude, the feedback DAC also has to transfer extremely small charges (order of a few femto-coulombs). Such constraints challenge the limits of existing process technologies. This paper investigates single bit feedback DAC architectures tailored specifically for very low charge transfers. Switched capacitor DACs are a viable means of transferring discrete charge packets accurately. Various DAC structures are compared using criteria such as absolute charge transfer error, effect of parasitic capacitances and the output referred noise. Accuracy of the feedback DAC is a major bottle-neck in the overall accuracy of the SD-ADC. The accuracy of the SD-ADC is compared for different feedback DAC structures. DAC structures are individually simulated using Spectre for 0.13um 3.3V standard CMOS technology. Based on circuit simulations, the feedback DAC is modeled in MATLAB as a combination of a `gain' block, `offset' error, additive noise and delay. A 1-bit 2nd order CT-SDM with the DAC model in the feedback path is used as a test vehicle and is simulated in MATLAB for accuracy calculations."
1579237,21220,8494,Digital microfluidic system: A new design for heterogeneous sample based integration of multiple DMFBs,2013,"A second generation Lab-on-chip device termed as digital micro fluidic biochip (DMFB) has been developed in recent years as a time multiplexed reconfigurable device capable of executing multiple bioassay protocols simultaneously on a single 2D planar array. Optical detection, processing and analysis are considered to be of major significance in bioassay operations as this may influence the conclusive decisions involving diagnosis, detection and testing. Detection results obtained from a series of tests in a single biochip - may prompt to perform next sequence of tests on separate biochips in order to converge towards specific disease profile, diagnosis and determination of the future course of treatment. In this paper we have first proposed a design of a digital detection analyzer circuit to be coupled with a biochip for execution of prescheduled multiple bioassay protocols. The analyzer enables automated detailed analysis of the optical detection results based on the data acquired at the detection site through successful Biochip operation for heterogeneous droplet samples. we further proposed a design of centralized controller that operates on the basis of the digitized output pattern obtained from the proposed analyzer for a specific test sequence and logically determines the address of the next biochip to perform the next test sequences destined in the diagnostic process flow using an intelligent database stored in the integrated system memory.

Recent advances in VLSI systems has focused on designing wireless neural recording systems which can be mounted on animals and acquire neural signals in real time. These advances provide an unparalleled opportunity to study phenomenon such as neural plasticity in both a basic science setting (learning and memory), and also a clinical setting (injury and recovery). Here we present an integrated VLSI system for wireless telemetry of the entire spectrum of neural signals, spikes, local field potentials, electrocorticograms (ECoG) and electroencephalograms (EEG). The system integrates two custom designed VLSI chips, a 16 channel neural interface which can amplify, filter and digitize neural data up to 16 kS/sec and 12 bits and a low power ultra-wideband (UWB) chip which can transmit data at rates up to 14 Mbps. The entire system which includes these VLSI circuits, a digital interface board and a battery, is small, 1.2×1.2×2.6 in 3 , and light weight, 33 grams, so it can be chronically mounted on a rat. The system consumes 32.8 mA at 3.3V and can record for 6 hours running from the 200 mAh coin cell battery. Bench-top and in vitro characterization of the system showed comparable performance to the wired recording system."
1155702,21220,9772,Microcells for ICA-SOC for remote sensing of high energy radiation,2014,"In ‘radiation remote sensing’ multiple unknown high energy sources are generally involved, and upon sensing the detectors must separate their contributions blindly for further analysis. That is, the objective is to recover the unobserved source signals from the observed mixtures without the knowledge of the mixing coefficients. An effective way to perform such separation is through Independent Component Analysis algorithm. This paper sets the background for this important application, shows successful application of the algorithm on actually measured multi-source data, develops an architecture for the ICA-SOC and, importantly, presents two major VLSI cells for it. A parallel architecture is presented utilizing two reconfigurable coarse-gain microcells with high functionality, performance, and reconfigurability. Fabricated in 0.5 micron CMOS process and tested, these comprise a two-cycle Universal Nonlinear (UNL) cell, and a two-cycle extended multiply accumulate (MA_PLUS) cell. The UNL includes two specialized functions for ICA, namely (1) the first derivative of an approximation to the negentropy function g(u) = G'(u) = u exp(-u2/2), and (2) the second derivative of the approximation to the negentropy function g′(u) = G″(u) = [1-u2]exp(-u2/2); The coarse-grain approach has the distinct advantages of reduced external interconnect, reduced design time, and manageable testability. The overall application goal is an intelligent sensor system for high energy radiation remote sensing, with integrated processing-and-decision-making capability, which can reliably separate threat radioactivity from the ambient one."
2253959,21220,8494,Accurate testing of ADC's spectral performance using imprecise sinusoidal excitations,2004,"Analog to digital converter (ADC) is the world's largest volume mixed-signal circuit. It is also a key building block in nearly all system on chip (SoC) solutions involving analog and mixed-signal functionalities. ADC testing is also crucial for built-in-self-test (BIST) solutions of AMS testing in SoC technology which is identified by the ITRS as one of four most daunting SoC challenges. ADC spectral testing is of critical importance to a large class of integrated circuits and is particularly challenging for high speed and/or high resolutions circuits. In this paper we use spectrally related excitations (SRE) to accurately test the spectral performance of ADCs. Unlike standard approaches, the SRE approach uses low-cost imprecise sine signals as input to the ADC and uses the spectral relationship between multiple input signals to separate distortion inherent in the ADC from that in the input. Efficient DSP algorithms are used to determine the true spectral performance of the ADC. This approach works in both production test and BIST environments. Simulation results show two sine waves with < 60 dB purity can be used to accurately test spectral performance of high resolution ADCs with SFDR in excess of 100 dB. The low-cost SRE signals can be readily generated with simple RC filters with lax band edge requirements. Extensive simulation shows that the algorithm is robust to filter errors, to nonstationary in the test environment, and to measurement noise."
289102,21220,8494,Model-assisted coding of video teleconferencing sequences at low bit rates,1994,"We present a novel and practical way to integrate techniques from computer vision to low bit rate coding systems for video teleconferencing applications. Our focus is to locate and track the faces of persons in typical head-and-shoulders video sequences, and to exploit the face location information in a classical video coding/decoding system. The motivation is to enable the system to selectively encode various image areas and to produce psychologically pleasing coded images where faces are sharper. We refer to this approach as model-assisted coding. We propose a totally automatic, low-complexity algorithm, which robustly performs face detection and tracking. A priori assumptions regarding sequence content are minimal and the algorithm operates accurately even in cases of occlusion by moving objects. Face location information is exploited by a low bit rate 3D subband-based video coder which uses a model-assisted dynamic bit allocation with object-selective quantization. By transferring a small fraction of the total available bit rate from the non-facial to the facial area, the coder produces images with better-rendered facial features. The improvement was found to be perceptually significant on video sequences coded at 96 kbps for an input luminance signal in CIF format. The technique is applicable to any video coding scheme that allows for fine-grain quantizer selection (e.g. MPEG, H.261), and can maintain full decoder compatibility. >"
2882598,21220,8806,"Learning to be efficient: algorithms for training low-latency, low-compute deep spiking neural networks",2016,"Recent advances have allowed Deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to perform at the same accuracy levels as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but have also highlighted a unique property of SNNs: whereas in ANNs, every neuron needs to update once before an output can be created, the computational effort in an SNN depends on the number of spikes created in the network. While higher spike rates and longer computing times typically improve classification performance, very good results can already be achieved earlier. Here we investigate how Deep SNNs can be optimized to reach desired high accuracy levels as quickly as possible. Different approaches are compared which either minimize the number of spikes created, or aim at rapid classification by enforcing the learning of feature detectors that respond to few input spikes. A variety of networks with different optimization approaches are trained on the MNIST benchmark to perform at an accuracy level of at least 98%, while monitoring the average number of input spikes and spikes created within the network to reach this level of accuracy. The majority of SNNs required significantly fewer computations than frame-based ANN approaches. The most efficient SNN achieves an answer in less than 42% of the computational steps necessary for the ANN, and the fastest SNN requires only 25% of the original number of input spikes to achieve equal classification accuracy. Our results suggest that SNNs can be optimized to dramatically decrease the latency as well as the computation requirements for Deep Neural Networks, making them particularly attractive for applications like robotics, where real-time restrictions to produce outputs and low energy budgets are common."
1160634,21220,8494,Digital signal processing for reducing the effects of RF imperfections in radio devices — An overview,2010,"Building compact and low-cost yet flexible and reconfigurable radios for future wireless systems is generally a challenging task. On one hand, the needs for flexibility and re-configurability prevent using dedicated hardware particularly designed and optimized for only a single application or part of the radio spectrum. And on the other hand, to keep the overall size and cost of the radio equipment feasible, especially in multi-antenna multi-radio scenarios, the cost and size of individual radios are strongly limited. As a result, various imperfections and impairments are expected to take place in the used radio transceivers, especially in the radio frequency (RF) analog electronics. Good examples of such imperfections are, e.g., mirror-frequency interference due to I/Q imbalance, non-linear distortion due to mixer and amplifier nonlinearities, timing jitter and non-linearities in sampling and analog-to-digital (A/D) converter circuits, and oscillator phase noise. These impairments, if not properly understood and taken into account, can easily become a limiting factor to the quality and performance of the radio device and thereon of the whole wireless link. This is even more so, when more complex and more sensitive high-order modulated wideband communications waveforms are being deployed in the future systems. This article gives an overview of the essential RF impairments in modern radio communication context. Furthermore, different conceptual alternatives for reducing the effects of RF impairments in radio transmitters and receivers utilizing digital signal processing are described."
389701,21220,8494,A novel reduced swing CMOS bus interface circuit for high speed low power VLSI systems,1994,"Major applications of CMOS VLSIs require the use of high fan out busses, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cross-bar switching matrices, high performance processors employing multiple busses, and high performance CPLDs using universal interconnection matrices. The bus interface circuits are major contributors to the power dissipation of a system for achieving high clocking frequencies. To address the increased power dissipation for high speed busses, a novel reduced voltage swing CMOS bus interface circuit is presented here. The design is a combination of drivers and receivers which perform level translation without any need to reduce the supply voltage. The simulation results based on these circuits show significant enhancements on both speed and power in comparison with the conventional CMOS tri-state driver techniques. To further assess this design, an LSI 32/spl times/32 crosspoint switch is implemented to be used for ATM communication systems. The chip uses a 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process with a die size of 4/spl times/3 mn, and has pseudo ECL input/output compatible interfaces which can operate at 250 Mb/s serial communication links per channel. The power consumption at 250 Mb/s is 0.6 W which is 60% lower than other published results for a similar switch. Without the input/output pad restrictions, the simulation results indicate that the switching matrix is capable of running at 622 Mb/s with a similar power reduction. >"
643751,21220,8494,Rise time analysis of MOBILE circuit,2002,"Recently, high-speed circuit applications using resonant tunnel diodes (RTDs) have attracted much attention due to their fast switching speed and increased Boolean functionality. For example, high-speed operation up to 35 Gb/s of a flip-flop circuit has been demonstrated using a pair of series connected RTDs, called a mono-stable bistable transition logic element (MOBILE) (K. Maezawa et al, IEEE Electron Dev. Lett., vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 80-82, 1998). It has been noted, however, that the MOBILE-type circuit has a critical value for the rise time of the supplied clock pulse, T/sub R//sup C/, which limits the operation speed (T.C.L.G. Sollner et al, Proc. Int. Semicond. Dev. Res. Symp., pp. 307-310, 1993). Several switching time analyses have been performed based on numerical simulation (K. Maezawa, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. vol. 34, no. 213, pp. 1213-1217, 1995; Y. Ohno et al, IEICE Trans. Electron., vol. E79-C, no. 11, pp. 1530-1536, 1996). From the circuit design point of view, however, a closed form of an analytical expression of T/sub R//sup C/ is necessary. In this paper, analytical expressions of T/sub R//sup C/ as well as a minimum total transition time are derived. The circuit parameter dependence of the operating speed is also analyzed."
2527342,21220,8494,Compact modeling of interconnect and substrate coupling at GHz frequencies,1999,"Interconnect performance can be solved to within arbitrary accuracy by numerical electromagnetic (E/M) simulation, but it is a much more challenging task to translate these results into an accurate, fast and robust lumped element model compatible for circuit simulation. The schematic is first chosen to reflect the physics as much as possible; and this helps to minimize the functional complexity of the lumped element values (parasitics). Nevertheless the parasitics still display frequency-dependences that should not be ignored. The models must be very robust to deal with the extremes of layout variations such as coupling between two metal lines that may be distant or may overlap or cross if they are on different layers. Some of the coupling parasitics can be determined with a 2-dimensional approach; but at the other extreme, substrate coupling requires a full 3-dimensional treatment. Attention must also be given to the circuit configuration of coupled lines: If each line provides the return path for the other, the current density concentrates toward the edge of the lines closest to the opposite line-significantly affecting the resistances and inductances at these frequencies. Finally there are the substrate doping and trench options that are useful depending on the situation, and these should also be modeled. A tool was developed (named HIPER) that calculates the lumped element values. HIPER is also used to calculate interactions with bond-pads (very short and fat lines) and with spiral inductors. Most models for spiral inductors assume a nearby ground, which is the case when they are measured-an assumption that can now be lifted."

While the various interfaces and their applications may look different, they are all based on strikingly similar, fundamental principles of biophysics, electrochemistry and information theory, and enabled by similar microfabrication and microelectronic technologies. Neural control is gradually converging on principles of design and best practices that can and should give rise to engineering standards and interchangeable components for recurring functions such as bioelectric recording and stimulation, transmission of power and data, and physical packaging and user interfaces. As such general tools become available, the clinical applications will be limited only by our understanding of the underlying pathologies, which are often best studied by those same tools. This virtuous circle consists of accessible technology enabling basic science enabling clinical applications generating business success motivating yet more technology."
982999,21220,8494,A many-core platform implemented for multi-channel seizure detection,2012,"This paper presents a reconfigurable many-core platform performing fixed point DSP applications supporting up to 64 cores routed in a hierarchical network. To demonstrate an application, electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure detection and analysis is mapped onto the cores. The individual cores are based on a 5 stage RISC pipeline architecture optimized to support communication to other cores on the platform. To reconfigure the platform, programs are loaded onto each of the cores. Communication between cores is implemented using low-area routers that partitions computational cores into hierarchical clusters resulting in a low network diameter. The routers use a packet-switched protocol that minimizes circuitry which further reduces circuit size in comparison to the computational circuitry. A globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) architecture is implemented to eliminate global clock routing which consumes high levels of power due to long propagation and thus high capacitive loading from many cores. Additionally, cores not configured for an application has its local clock disabled which turns off unused cores. The overall result is a platform with lower power consumption than a traditional single core DSP with the reconfigurability lacking in an ASIC. Applications tested within the mapping include the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. The seizure detection and analysis algorithm, when mapped onto the many-core platform, takes 5663 cycles to execute in 14.45 µs.

1850951,21220,8494,Fundamental Bounds on Power Reduction during Data-Retention in Standby SRAM,2007,"The authors study leakage-power reduction in standby random access memories (SRAMs) during data-retention. An SRAM cell requires a minimum critical supply voltage (DRV) above which it preserves the stored-bit reliably. Due to process-variations, the intra-chip DRV exhibits variation with a distribution having a diminishing tail. In order to minimize leakage power while preserving data reliably, existing low-power design methods use a worst-case standby supply voltage. This worst-case voltage is larger than the highest DRV among all cells in an SRAM. In contrast, the approach uses aggressive voltage reduction and counters the ensuing unreliability by an error-control code based memory architecture. Using this approach, we explore fundamental trade-offs between power reduction and redundancy present in the SRAM. The authors establish fundamental bounds on the power reduction in terms of the DRV-distribution using techniques from information theory and algebraic coding theory. For an experimental test-chip DRV-distribution in the 90nm CMOS technology, the authors show that 49% power reduction with respect to (w.r.t.) the worst-case is a fundamental lower bound while 40% power reduction w.r.t. the worst-case is achievable by using a practical algebraic coding scheme. The authors also study the power reduction as a function of the block-length for low-latency codes since most applications using SRAM are latency constrained. The authors propose a reliable low-power memory architecture based on the Hamming code for the next test-chip implementation with a predicted power reduction of 33% while accounting for coding overheads"

To determine whether a physically active patient such as an amputee can take advantage of these systems, we seek to develop an animal model of freely moving humans. Therefore, we have developed and tested HermesC, a system for recording neural activity from electrode arrays implanted in rhesus monkeys and transmitting this data wirelessly. This system is based on the integrated neural interface (INI) microchip, which amplifies, digitizes, and transmits neural data across a ~900 MHz wireless channel. The wireless transmission has a range of ~4 m in free space. All together, this device consumes 11.7 mA from a 4.0 V lithium ion battery pack for a total of 46.8 mW. To test the performance, the device was used to record and telemeter one channel of broadband neural data at 15.7 kSps from one monkey doing various physical activities in a home cage, such as eating, climbing and swinging. The in-band noise of the recorded neural signal is 34 muVrms, which is low enough to allow the detection of neural units on an active electrode. This system can be readily upgraded to use future generations of the INI chip, with circuits providing 96 channels of programmable threshold crossing event data."
476288,21220,8494,A fine-grain asynchronous VLSI cellular array processor architecture,1995,"The cellular iterative computation model bears upon three broad-ranging application domains: pixel-level image processing, finite-difference approximation of continuum problems (boundary value PDEs) in computational physics, and cellular automata as discrete models of complex locally-interacting systems, aimed at probing their emergent collective properties. The common underlying idea is to compute the global dynamics of a lattice-structured state-space through the iterative propagation of purely local computational dependencies between state-components. A past generation of mesh-connected SIMD array-processors, among which the MPP [Bat 80], CLIP [Pre 84] and CAM [Tof 87] machines, were canonical architectural mappings of this fruitful concept. All were fine-grain synchronous solutions. The new generation of MIMD RISC-based parallel computers that superseded them are essentially coarse-grain and asynchronous; They can simulate a cellular iterative model in a parallel pseudo-synchronous SPMD mode with global coordination mechanisms. A fine-grain asynchronous architectural model departs in a somewhat paradoxical way from these two mainstream approaches. The idea is to match an architecture with a functional concept of a synchronism, specific to cellular relaxation algorithms. As we show in the following, benefits accrue at both levels from this matching."

Powered by a 1.2-V supply, the modulator consumes 1.8 to 4.2mW, which results in simulated FOMs of 15.5 to 27.8fJ/conversion."
2331882,21220,8494,A 700Mbit/s CMOS capacitive feedback front-end amplifier with automatic gain control for broadband optical wireless links,2008,"Optical wireless (OW) communication links are emerging as a promising broadband wireless access technology. This paper presents a transimpedance-limiting amplifier (TIA-LA) analog front-end to overcome challenges faced by high-speed optical wireless links requiring wide field-of-view (FOV), high dynamic range imaging receivers for signal acquisition/tracking. The front-end amplifier presented consists of a transimpedance amplifier combined with a limiting amplifier and, for the first time, employs a self-biased automatic gain control (AGC) circuit within a capacitive feedback configuration TIA. The front-end is designed for integration with wide FOV detectors with associated capacitance up to 5pF and its performance is insensitive (within 10%) to an order of magnitude variation in input capacitance. The self-biased AGC allows 40 dB dynamic range in received optical power to accommodate varying link ranges and different OW system configurations. The TIA-LA achieves a maximum total gain of 66 dBOmega, -3 dB bandwidth of 540 MHz at 5pF detector capacitance, and variable TIA gain from 53 dBOmega to 42 dBOmega without instability. The expected sensitivity of this optical receiver front-end is -20.1 dBm at a BER of 10 -12  and total power dissipation of 209 mW from dual 3.3 V and 1.8 V supply voltages in a 0.5 um CMOS process."
1410470,21220,8494,Hybrid processor population for odor processing,2012,"Some computationally complex problems require complex solutions in terms of number of processors and diversity of computation methods. Metabolic systems are naturally capable of solving complex problems; they are mathematically modelled with hundreds of differential equations. In order to understand those metabolisms or simply replicate their functions in engineering problems, we need a large network of processors that is designed to mimic biological systems. Moreover, many processes take place in metabolic networks are results of collaboration of different types of cells that are randomly located. Therefore, bio-inspired topologically random mega-core networks of hybrid processors are needed to solve complex biological problems. Introducing randomness into a hybrid processor network that employs thousands of processors requires special techniques. We are proposing a solution to mega-core architectures with multi-type processors. Our aim in this work is to obtain a very large collaborative network of hybrid processors that has reconfigurable random topology. Our solution provides reconfiguration of a large network with different types of processors so that the network can be adapted to many different problems or can be used to mimic different metabolic functions. In this work, we are trying to solve the speed problem in artificial olfaction systems by a hybrid processor feature extractor that performs spatio-temporal coding inspired from nature. The technique is also efficient in realization; it is based on adding an 'identity' pin that will be used to reconfigure the identical processors. In this work we propose our technique to generate hybrid processor populations on any array platform or networks of single type processors and report the implementation on FPGA."
2819773,21220,8494,A portable impedance-based electrochemical measurement device,2016,"We present a low-cost, portable electrochemical analysis system using impedimetric measurements rather than more commonly used potentiometric techniques. The presented impedance spectroscopy (impedimetric) technique uses a small perturbation to obtain a linearized response without affecting the composition of the sample as opposed to cyclic voltammetry (potentiometric) which repeatedly reduces and oxidizes the sample. The presented system consists of an Arduino UNO microcontroller, a CMOS digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, a potentiostat, and data acquisition (DAQ) hardware. The Arduino UNO is loaded with a program we have written to generate sinusoidal excitation signals in conjunction with the CMOS DAC chip. The CMOS chip fabricated in a standard 0.5 micron CMOS process contains a DAC with a unity gain buffer circuit. The potentiostat is capable of carrying out impedance measurements with both the Randles model and a potassium chloride (KCl) solution. We describe a behavioral model of the op-amp used in the potentiostat using Verilog-A hardware description language. Verilog-A simulations reduced the error relative to standard Cadence simulations and compare well with known Randles RC values giving an error less than 1%. The impedance measurements for a KCl electrochemical solution were performed with our system and a commercial electrochemical workstation (Gamry) giving a relative error up to 16% for lower frequencies (below 37 Hz) and up to 31% at higher frequencies."

The ever decreasing device feature size with CMOS scaling, has resulted in an increasing uncertainty in predicting the exact device behaviour. The issue of variability needs to be addressed across the entire hierarchy of integrated circuits - optimization of process and device technology to yield minimal variability, robust circuit and system design architectures for variability aware design, and CAD tools to unify these two domains. The traditional variability modeling and CAD techniques address the problem in one of the two domains. We propose a unified framework to bridge the gap between technology CAD and design CAD. This framework enables one to directly relate the variation in circuit metrics such as speed, static power and dynamic power to the underlying semiconductor process parameters such as implant dose, annealing temperature etc. The proposed methodology is validated through rigorous simulations at the process, device and circuit level, incorporating various statistical techniques. A few examples will be presented to elaborate the significance of the proposed modeling methodology and its utility in the Nano CMOS design flow. In addition to being an important utility in the circuit design flow, the methodology will also help the foundries by providing a visibility on the impact of unit processes on the eventual circuit characteristics. This in turn can help in a systematic and optimized process monitoring in the foundries."

660195,21220,8494,Approach for physical design in sub-100 nm era,2005,"In sub-100 nm processes, various physical phenomena come up as critical red-brick in designing circuits and LSIs. We focus on design for variability (DFV) for LSI-chip design, taking within-die variations into consideration. The main approach for the purpose is a new test structure, TEG (test element group), to measure the within-die variation of elements (MOS, R, C) and ring-oscillators. The precise measurement has been achieved with careful TEG design, including on-chip circuit, such as CBCM, Kelvin pattern. Reliable measurement data were analyzed statistically. Variation-caused systematic and random physical sources have been successfully decomposed with a newly developed extraction strategy. The data exhibits an extremely large variation in N/PMOS drain current (I/sub ds/) and threshold voltage (V/sub th/). The main sources of the random variation are doping fluctuation and line edge roughness (LER) in small size MOS transistors. I/sub ds/ variation is affected by the doping fluctuation. On the other hand, V/sub th/ variation is sensitive to LER. Interconnect variation is essentially small compared with the I/sub ds//V/sub th/ variation of MOS transistors; however, its variation is systematic component dominant. Ring oscillator T/sub pd/ variation is found to be closely related to I/sub ds/ variation, showing a correlation coefficient of 0.9. Design for variability is one of the most difficult challenges in 65-90 nm processes. Statistical design in the early stages will be necessary."
2170029,21220,8494,A pencil balancing robot using a pair of AER dynamic vision sensors,2009,"Balancing a normal pencil on its tip requires rapid feedback control with latencies on the order of milliseconds. This demonstration shows how a pair of spike-based silicon retina dynamic vision sensors (DVS) is used to provide fast visual feedback for controlling an actuated table to balance an ordinary pencil. Two DVSs view the pencil from right angles. Movements of the pencil cause spike address-events (AEs) to be emitted from the DVSs. These AEs are transmitted to a PC over USB interfaces and are processed procedurally in real time. The PC updates its estimate of the pencil's location and angle in 3d space upon each incoming AE, applying a novel tracking method based on spike-driven fitting to a model of the vertical shape of the pencil. A PD-controller adjusts X-Y-position and velocity of the table to maintain the pencil balanced upright. The controller also minimizes the deviation of the pencil's base from the center of the table. The actuated table is built using ordinary high-speed hobby servos which have been modified to obtain feedback from linear position encoders via a microcontroller. Our system can balance any small, thin object such as a pencil, pen, chop-stick, or rod for many minutes. Balancing is only possible when incoming AEs are processed as they arrive from the sensors, typically at intervals below millisecond ranges.

2302111,21220,8494,Embryonics: a new family of coarse-grained field-programmable gate array with self-repair and self-reproducing properties,1996,"The growth and the operation of all living beings are directed through the interpretation, in each of their cells, of a chemical program, the DNA. This program, called genome, is the blueprint of the organism and consists of a sequence of four discrete characters: A, C, G, and T. This process is the source of inspiration for the Embryonics (embryological electronics) project, whose final objective is the conception of very large scale integrated circuits endowed with properties usually associated with the living world: self-repair (cicatrization) and self-reproduction. Within this framework, we will present a new family of coarse-grained field-programmable gate arrays. Each cell is a binary decision machine whose microprogram represents the genome, and each part of the microprogram is a gene whose execution depends on the physical position of the cell in the array, i.e. on its coordinates. The considerable redundancy introduced by the presence of a genome in each cell has significant advantages: self-reproduction (the automatic production of one or more copies of the original organism) and self-repair (the automatic repair of one or more faulty cells) become relatively simple operations. Even if the described system seems exceedingly complex, we believe that computer architectures inspired by molecular biology will allow the development of new FPGAs endowed with quasi-biological properties extremely useful in environments where human intervention is necessarily limited (nuclear plants, space applications, etc.)."

When received at the base station, the desired user's modulated data sequence suffers from both the ISI induced by the dispersive channel environment and the presence of MAI from the other users. A turbo-principle alike chip-level 2D-RAKE receiver, employing a space-time processing technique, coupled with a bank of SISO channel decoders, is proposed to combat the ISI and MAI simultaneously without strict power control limitations. The estimated symbol for each user is performed by collecting a corresponding chip-level estimated sequence, which is the output through the soft interference suppressor and the instantaneous linear vector filter, prior to conducting the despreading operation. In the simulations, the performance improvements at moderate system load and low SNRs under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading and near-far limited environments are demonstrated when compared to the conventional non-iterative 2D-RAKE receiver, justifying the efficacy of the addressed iterative space-time multiuser demodulator in the long-code CDMA system. A comparison to a coded receiver which combines a hard-decision multiuser detector with a bank of Viterbi decoders in a manner of low computational complexity is also manifested."

The feeding network consists of four conventional Wilkinson power dividers which can be individually reconfigured in length using PIN diodes switches. By controlling the bias voltages of these PIN diodes, the operating frequency of the proposed design can be converted between four different bands: 600MHz-900MHz, 1.2GHz-1.6GHz, 1.8GHz-2.2GHz and 2.4GHz-2.6GHz. The first frequency band (600MHz-900MHz) is applied to satisfy the applications of LTE US (700MHz), LTE UK (800MHz) and GSM (850MHz, 900MHz). The second band (1.2GHz-1.6GHz) targets GPS L1 (1.575GHz) and GPS L2 (1.227GHz). Different GSM (1800MHz, 1900MHz) and 3G standards (UMTS, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA and CDMA2000) are located in the third frequency band (1.8GHz-2.2GHz). The last band (2.4GHz-2.6GHz) is used to cover WiFi (2.45GHz) and LTE Europe (2.6GHz).

The reconfigurable feeding network can be particularly applied to commercial multiband communication systems."

A totally implant hearing aids system integrating implant microphone, interface electronics, speech processor, stimulator, and cochlear electrodes, can overcome the discomfort, inconvenient, and social stigma associate with the conventional and semi-implantable hearing aids. This paper presents the results of four years in vitro study to use micro-chip acoustic sensors, serving as implant microphones, to directly sense the umbo acoustic vibration and convert it into high quality sound signal at the output. Umbo vibration characteristics were extracted from literatures and laboratory data. A PZT vibration source was built to simulate the umbo receiving 40 to 100 dB SPL sound input. A laboratory model using commercial electrets- microphone as the sensor was studied in laboratory and on several temporal bones. Near flat frequency response from 250 to 8000Hz was measured with minimum detectable signal about 65 dB SPL at 1 kHz, limited by the sensitivity of the microphone and amplifier noise. From these results, an MEMS acoustic displacement sensor chip was designed and fabricated to increase the sensitivity and to provide an easy mounting method on umbo. The prototype device can detect 40 dB SPL sound in 1-2 kHz region, assuming 100Hz channel bandwidth. Test results on temporal bones are being cumulated and was presented."

This paper focuses on choosing optimal Continuous Valued Number System (CVNS) neural networks, and shows using system-level analysis that how CVNS networks can be used to implement large size networks. The network is implemented using analog non-linear activation function with more precision, and provides more accuracy in comparison to analog networks. The CVNS computation system which is used as an alternative method of implementation, is analog in nature and employs digit-level analog modular arithmetic. The information redundancy among the digits can be used to increase the accuracy of the precision using analog circuitry with arbitrary accuracy. Moreover, the system configuration take advantage of distributed neuron properties. This type of neurons reduce overall network sensitivity to mismatches that are inherent in any neural networks implemented by analog circuitries. Moreover, to reduce the network complexity in terms of number of interconnections, a series configuration of multiplexer and demultiplexer is used. Weights are refreshed and refined as an overall approach to maintain the weights stored on chip, and are not used to compute network response. To study overall accuracy of the system, stochastic modeling of the network is carried out. The proposed network has comparable sensitivity to other CVNS Madaline, while reduces the network complexity in terms of reducing computing units and interconnections proportional by a factor proportional to the network nodes."
1843015,21220,8494,Efficient intra-4×4 mode decision based on bit-rate estimation in H.264/AVC,2008,"Rate-distortion optimization (RDO) technique is widely employed by H.264/AVC for the purpose of determining the best mode. However, such technique results in dramatic increase in the computation complexity of the underlying encoder. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an efficient intra-4x4 mode decision algorithm. The algorithm works by approximating the bit-rate so as to reduce the computational cost of RDO and the main idea is the following: First we have found a quick way to estimate the bit-rate via the number of DCT coefficients to be quantized to 0 and that to be quantized to plusmn1. The parameters of the estimated function are adaptively obtained by using the Least Squares Fitting method of the above and the left block in the current frame and the co-location one in the previous encoded frame as the feedback. This close loop bit-rate estimation would skip the processes of quantization, inverse transform, entropy coding and reconstruction; we then use the estimated bit-rate and Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) to simplify the optimization process of R-D cost function. Experimental results show that our scheme decreases the time for intra coding by 50% with negligible loss of PSNR, and that comparing with those fast mode-decision algorithms based-on local edge direction, the optimal prediction mode obtained via our scheme is closer to that obtained via the original RDO in statistic."

CPG networks display oscillatory activities that actuates individual or groups of muscles in a coordinated fashion so that the limbs of the animal are flexed and extended at the appropriate time and with the required velocity for the animal to efficiently traverse various types of terrain, and to recover from environmental perturbation. Typically, the CPG networks are constructed with many neurons, each of which has a number of control parameters. As the number of muscles increases, it is often impossible to manually, albeit intelligently, select the network parameters for a particular movement. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible to reconfigure the parameters on-line. This paper describes how genetic algorithms (GA) can be used for on-line (re)configuring of CPG networks for a bipedal robot. We show that the neuron parameters and connection weights/network topology of a canonical walking network can be reconfigured within a few of generations of the GA. The networks, constructed with integrate-and-fire-with-adaptation (IFA) neurons, are implemented with a microcontroller and can be reconfigured to vary walking speed from 0.5Hz to 3.5Hz. The phase relationship between the hips and knees can be arbitrarily set (to within 1 degree) and prescribed complex joint angle profiles are realized. This is a powerful approach to generating complex muscle synergies for robots with multiple joints and distributed actuators."

I. Introduction A magnetic Hall sensor is a transducer, which converts a magnetic field into a corresponding electrical signal. Magnetic Hall micro-sensors generally use integrated Hall plates as sensing devices, which are fully compatible with standard CMOS technologies. Hall e ect sensors are widely used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications. Typically, Hall plates are used in voltage-mode and for many years voltage-mode Hall sensors have been absolutely dominant in most of the applications. This means that the mag- netic field to be measured is converted into an output voltage. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and o set are important features in Hall sensors performance evaluation. Several techniques have been developed in order to improve these characteristics. Most of them, (1)-(5), are based on conventional voltage-mode Hall transducers. Parasitic capacitances and their e ect, specially at high frequency operation, a ect performance of voltage-mode solutions. As an alternative solution, an Hall sensor can work in the current mode. The output is current and not voltage. In the current-mode Hall sensors there is no variation of the terminal potentials and so no influence of the parasitic capacitances. Also, it can be possible to use of smaller number of terminals, therefore the ultimate miniaturization of the device is easier, (1). This paper presents a low power current-mode Hall sensor microsystem with di erential output current, as shown in Fig. 1. The physical structure of the proposed current-mode Hall sensor is the same of modern devices, with the same possibility of compensating for the o set caused by mismatch (current spinning). The di erence is in driving and extracting the signal. Extensive and accurate physical simulations and behavioral models of the current-mode Hall sensors allowed optimizing its size, shape and performance for the chosen technology, a standard 0.18- m CMOS technology.

706544,21220,8494,Minimum mean squared error time series classification using an echo state network prediction model,2006,"The echo state network (ESN) has been recently proposed as an alternative recurrent neural network model. An ESN consists of a reservoir of conventional processing elements, which are recurrently interconnected with untrained random weights, and a readout layer, which is trained using linear regression methods. The key advantage of the ESN is the ability to model systems without the need to train the recurrent weights. In this paper, we use an ESN to model the production of speech signals in a classification experiment using isolated utterances of the English digits zero through nine. One prediction model for each digit was trained using frame-based speech features (cepstral coefficients) from all train utterances, and the readout layer consisted of several linear regressors which were trained to target different portions of the time series using a dynamic programming algorithm (Viterbi). Each novel test utterance was classified with the label from the digit model with the minimum mean squared prediction error. Using a corpus of 4130 isolated digits from 8 male and 8 female speakers, the highest classification accuracy attained with an ESN was 100.0% (99.1%) on the train (test) set, compared to 100% (94.7%) for a hidden Markov model (HMM). HMM performance increased to 100.0% (99.8%) when context features (first- and second-order temporal derivatives) were appended to the cepstral coefficients. The ESN offers an attractive alternative to the HMM because of the ESN's simple train procedure, low computational requirements, and inherent ability to model the dynamics of the signal under study."
2319203,21220,8494,An Organic Computing architecture for visual microprocessors based on Marching Pixels,2007,"The paper presents architecture and synthesis results for an organic computing hardware for smart CMOS camera chips. The organic behavior in the chip hardware is based on distributed and emergent functionality exploited for detection of objects and their center points given in binary images. Future real-time embedded systems used in industrial image processing have to provide reply times in the range of milliseconds. It is impossible to meet such strict requirements for megapixel resolutions with serial processing schemes in particular if multiple given objects have to be detected. Even classical parallel techniques like SIMD or MIMD approaches are not sufficient due to their dependency on more or less central control structures. To achieve more flexibility, unlimited scalability and higher performance parallel emergent architectures are necessary. We present such an approach, denoted as marching pixels, for future digital visual microprocessors. Marching pixels work similar to artificial ants. They are crawling as hardware agents within a pixel field, e.g. to identify and to detect center points of an arbitrary number of objects given in an image. We present an emergent marching pixel algorithm for the processing of arbitrary concave objects and its mapping onto real hardware. Based on synthesis results for FPGAs and ASICs we discuss the possibilities of digital organic computing approaches for visual microprocessors for future smart high-speed camera systems."
1861675,21220,8494,High speed digital CMOS divide-by-N fequency divider,2008,"A high-speed scalable programmable divide-by-N frequency divider is presented. The divider includes a new proposed state look-ahead parallel counter with a basic conventional D-type Flip-Flop (DFF) circuit. The counter is structured from two modules of 2-bit counter stages separated by DFF buffers, where all are triggered at the edge of the input clock. The reload circuit is a single DFF buffer, while the detecting count circuit is constructed from a two level decoder. The M-bit divider critical path delay, which is independent of technology, is approximated to [3.5 + Log4 (M)] of a unit delay close to a 2-input NAND gate. This results in a measured frequency, which slightly drops to about 6% against the increase of the divider bit size. Furthermore, the divider circuit is attractive for continued technology scaling since the architecture is based on using identical modules of small count of CMOS transistors with only threshold voltage technology limitations. The measure rate of the number of transistors is approximated to a linear increase of about 17% per a two-bit increase of the divider size. The presented 8-bit programmable divide-by-N frequency divider is capable of operating up to 2 GHz for a 1.35 V power supply voltage with a maximum power consumption of 16.78 mW and a maximum frequency divider factor of N=256 using the TSMC 0.15 mum digital CMOS process, and gives a measured area of 95*143 mum 2  with a total count of 508 transistors."

The emergence of standard languages such as VHDL-AMS has made it possible to now describe a variety of physical systems using a single design approach and simulate a complete system. Application areas where this is becoming increasingly important include mixed-signal electronics, electro-magnetic interfaces, integrated thermal modeling, electro-mechanical and mechanical systems (including MEMS), fluidics (including hydraulics and micro-fluidics), power electronics with digital control and sensors of various kinds. In this paper, we will show how the behavioral modeling of multiple energy domains is achieved using VHDL-AMS, demonstrating with the use of examples how the interactions between domains takes place, and provide an insight into design techniques for a variety of these disciplines. The basic framework is described, showing how standard packages can define a coherent basis for a wide range of models, and specific examples used to illustrate the practical details of such an approach.

1180940,21220,8494,Performance analysis of transform in uncoded wireless visual communication,2013,"In wireless scenarios where the channel condition may vary drastically, visual communication systems using source and channel coding generally suffer from threshold effect. An uncoded transmission scheme called SoftCast [1]-[3], however, was recently shown to provide both graceful quality transition and competitive performance. In SoftCast, image signal is directly modulated to a dense constellation using proper power for transmission, solely after employing a transform for energy compaction, leaving out conventional quantization, entropy coding and channel coding. The received signal is lossy in nature, with its noise level commensurate with the channel condition. This paper presents a theoretical analysis for uncoded visual communication, focusing on the role of transform and the quantitative measurement of transform gain in a generalized uncoded transmission framework with optimal power allocation. Our analysis reveal that the energy distribution among signal elements plays an important role in the power-distortion performance. Further analysis show that the energy compaction capability of decorrelation transform can bring significant gain by boosting the energy diversity in signal representation. Numerical analysis results are reported for Markov random signals and natural images, respectively. The performance of typical transforms, e.g. KLT, DCT and DWT, and the effect of different transform sizes or levels are evaluated. These analysis results are verified by simulations."
651288,21220,8494,"A CMOS three-state frequency detector complementary to an enhanced linear phase detector for PLL, DLL or high frequency clock skew measurement",2003,"A novel three state frequency detector (FD) is proposed and analysed. It complements a linear phase detector (PD). The parallel combination of these two detectors gives a new Phase-frequency detector (PFD), in which the frequency detection turns off when the phase difference is below 180 degrees. Thus, mismatches in the FD cannot affect the phase accuracy. This feature allows the designer to create a high-speed, no dead-zone wide capture range PLL, with low noise generation or sensitivity, and low power consumption. The enhanced linear PD has a higher gain at /spl plusmn/180 degrees and a better transfer function at high frequency than previous proposals. Those advantages give a better behaviour nearby /spl plusmn/180 degrees or at high frequencies, when the PD is used with the FD, in PLLs, or without the FD, like in Delay Locked Loops (DLL). It can detect phase differences between various signals selected from a broad class of waveform types. Results presented in this paper show that the proposed PD can cover a wide range of frequencies that easily reaches up to 4 GHz when implemented with TSMC 0.18 micron CMOS. The detector remains accurate and linear up to the highest experimented frequencies. Thus, it can be useful for precise analog clock skew measurements. Its simple topology uses only 24 MOS transistors that can be mostly of minimum size."
2118136,21220,8494,A mismatch calibrated bipolar spatial contrast AER retina with adjustable contrast threshold,2009,"Address Event Representation (AER) is an emergent technology for assembling modular multi-blocks bio-inspired sensory and processing systems. Visual sensors (retinae) are among the first AER modules to be reported since the introduction of the technology. Spatial contrast AER retinae are of special interest since they provide highly compressed data flow without reducing the relevant information required for performing recognition. Reported AER contrast retinae perform a contrast computation based on the ratio between a pixel's local light intensity and a spatially weighted average of its neighbourhood. This resulted in compact circuits, but with the penalty of all pixels generating output signals even if they sensed no contrast. In this paper we present a spatial contrast retina with bipolar output: contrast is computed as the relative difference between a pixel's local light and its weighted spatial average. As a result, contrast includes a sign and the output will be zero if there is no contrast. Furthermore, an adjustable thresholding mechanism has been included, such that pixels remain silent until they sense an absolute contrast above the adjustable threshold. The pixel contrast computation circuit is based on Boahen's Biharmonic operator contrast circuit, which has been improved to include mismatch calibration and adaptive current based biasing. As a result, the contrast computation circuit shows much less mismatch, is almost insensitive to ambient light illumination, and biasing is much less critical than in the original voltage biasing scheme. A full AER retina version has been submitted for fabrication. In the present paper we provide simulation results."
1642838,21220,8494,Complexity analysis of next-generation HEVC decoder,2012,"This paper analyzes the complexity of the HEVC video decoder being developed by the JCT-VC community. The HEVC reference decoder HM 3.1 is profiled with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The analysis covers both Low Complexity (LC) and High Efficiency (HE) settings for resolutions varying from WQVGA (416 × 240 pixels) up to 1600p (2560 × 1600 pixels). The yielded cycle-accurate results are compared with the respective results of H.264/AVC Baseline Profile (BP) and High Profile (HiP) reference decoders. HEVC offers significant improvement in compression efficiency over H.264/AVC: the average BD-rate saving of LC is around 51% over BP whereas the BD-rate gain of HE is around 45% over HiP. However, the average decoding complexities of LC and HE are increased by 61% and 87% over BP and HiP, respectively. In LC, the most complex functions are motion compensation (MC) and loop filtering (LF) that account on average for 50% and 14% of the decoder complexity. The decoding complexity of HE configuration is on average 42% higher than that of the LC configuration. Majority of the difference is caused by extra LF stages. In HE, the complexities of MC and LF are 37% and 32%, respectively. In practice, a standard 3 GHz dual core processor is expected to be able to decode 1080p HEVC content in real-time."
1678562,21220,8494,High-efficient hardware design based on enhanced Tschirnhaus transform for solving the LSPs,2013,"This work presents a novel hardware design based on the enhanced Tschirnhaus transform (ETT) to solve the 8-order line spectral pairs (LSPs). To reduce high-complexity problems caused by fractional multiplication, the ETT is proposed to replace such operations with integer-based shift and addition operations of the original Tschirnhaus transform. Also, the data dependency graph (DDG) of the ETT is analyzed for designing hardware units and reducing computation cycles. The proposed hardware has two key blocks: the mixture computation unit (MCU) and the multiplier-free pipelined square-root unit (PSRU). The first block is designed to fast calculate multiplication and summation operations in the ETT with the use of a two-stage pipeline architecture. The second is developed to speed up square-root operations after 8-order LSPs are decomposed into two 4-order LSPs. It can also timely process the result of the first block within limited cycles. The experimental results show that compared with the Chebyshev-based research, the proposed hardware can reduce the cycle times by 98.1% and also saved about 49.7% of gate counts. In the precision evaluation, the result indicates that 95% of the computation errors are within 0.02 and proves that the proposed hardware is capable of quantizing LSPs almost as accurately as computers do. Such results reveal that the proposed work is superior to the other Chebyshev-based methods, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed design."
2155695,21220,8494,"A 13MHz input, 480MHz output Fractional Phase Lock Loop with 1MHz bandwidth",2010,"A 13MHz input, 480MHz output Fractional Phase Lock Loop (PLL), having 1MHz bandwidth, is presented here. To handle the non-integer feedback divider ratio (480/13), a novel approach is chosen. A Delay Lock Loop (DLL) is used to generate 13 phases of the 480MHz VCO clock; one of these phases is multiplexed to an integer mode feedback divider; every reference cycle the multiplexer shifts to the adjacent phase, resulting in the period of the feedback clock, after the divider, being 1/13 th  of a VCO clock period short of an integer multiple. This results in an effective fractional division. The Phase Detector (PD) does not see any phase errors due to this operation; hence no additional filtering is required in the loop. The loop bandwidth can therefore be maintained to a value as high as one tenth of the reference clock, in contrast to other popular fractional PLL schemes. The affect of the DLL to the PLL loop stability and jitter is analyzed and found to be non significant. The PLL can be re-configured to also support 15.36MHz and 16.8MHz in fractional mode, and 20MHz, 19.2MHz, 12MHz, 24MHz and 48MHz in integer mode, while always maintaining high bandwidth. The PLL is designed and simulated in 90nm CMOS. It occupies an area of 0.1 sq mm, and does not require off-chip components."
2035358,21220,8494,Distraction-related EEG dynamics in virtual reality driving simulation,2008,"Driver distraction has been recognized as a significant cause of traffic incidents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics in response to distraction during driving. To study human cognition under specific driving task, we used virtual reality (VR) based driving simulation to simulate events including unexpected car deviations and mathematics questions (math) in real driving. For further assessing effects of the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the deviation onset and math presented on the EEG dynamics, we designed five cases with different SOA. The scalp-recorded EEG channel signals were first separated into independent brain sources by independent component analysis (ICA). Then, the event-related-spectral-perturbations (ERSP) measuring changes of EEG power spectra were used to evaluate the brain dynamics in time-frequency domains. Results showed that increases of theta band (5~7.8 Hz) and beta band (12.2~17 Hz) power were observed in the frontal cortex. Results demonstrated that reaction time and multiple cortical EEG sources responded to the driving deviations and math occurrences differentially in the stimulus onset asynchrony. Results also suggested that the theta band power increase in frontal area could be used as the distracted indexes for early detecting driver's inattention in the future."
1417708,21220,8494,CARE: A dynamic stereo vision sensor system for fall detection,2012,"This paper presents a recently developed dynamic stereo vision sensor system and its application for fall detection towards safety for elderly at home. The system consists of (1) two optical detector chips with 304×240 event-driven pixels which are only sensitive to relative light intensity changes, (2) an FPGA for interfacing the detectors, early data processing, and stereo matching for depth map reconstruction, (3) a digital signal processor for interpreting the sensor data in real-time for fall recognition, and (4) a wireless communication module for instantly alerting caring institutions. This system was designed for incident detection in private homes of elderly to foster safety and security. The two main advantages of the system, compared to existing wearable systems are from the application's point of view: (a) the stationary installation has a better acceptance for independent living comparing to permanent wearing devices, and (b) the privacy of the system is systematically ensured since the vision detector does not produce real images such as classic video sensors. The system can actually process about 300 kevents per second. It was evaluated using 500 fall cases acquired with a stuntman. More than 90% positive detections were reported. We will show a live demonstration during ISCAS2012 of the sensor system and its capabilities."
510020,21220,8494,Simulation of SOI transistor circuits through non-equilibrium initial condition analysis (NEICA),2006,"The simulation of circuits containing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors encounters specific difficulties mainly due to the presence of the insulated body nodes, i.e., connected by high impedance connections with the rest of the circuit. These high impedance connections cause the charges stored in transistor body nodes to change at much slower rates than the normal operation of the circuit. Therefore the short term operation of a circuit will be strongly dependent on the state of the SOI transistor body charge, which in turn depends on the activity of the transistor during thousands of the previous cycles: the history effect. The presence of high impedance connections has another adverse effect on the simulation of such circuits: circuit matrices become severely ill-conditioned, thus slowing down or even compromising the convergence of the initial DC solution. In this paper, we are introducing the novel non-equilibrium, initial condition analysis (NEICA), as the preferred initialization method for circuits containing SOI devices. This method allows the user full control of the initial state of the SOI devices, preserves full insight into the physical phenomenon, and leads to a well-conditioned and thus reliable transient analysis initialization problem. The method is easily implemented in most existing circuit simulation programs and facilitates other important applications beyond the analysis of SOI transistor circuits. ESD analysis, and simulation of the effects of charged particles hitting circuits, are just two such examples."
410589,21220,8494,Frequency and phase tuning of continuous-time integrated filters using common-mode signals,1994,"A system for frequency- and Q-factor tuning resulting in a self-tuned filter is proposed. The method uses a common-mode (CM) signal as reference. No master filter is required since CM reference signals are directly applied to the main filter built as two separate but identical single-ended paths. Since the two filters are built as cascade designs the tuning signal can be conveniently applied to the inputs of the two highest-Q biquads. By summing the outputs of these biquads the differential signals cancel and the resulting CM tuning signal is used in classical frequency- and Q-tuning schemes. CM tuning signals are rejected at the output of the filter by a differential buffer. For a monolithic realization, a 7th-order equiripple delay filter with cut-off frequency tunable from 5 MHz to 40 MHz and the maximum and of 2 has been selected. It is built with a single-ended double-input CMOS triode transconductor (GM) and a lossy biquad which requires no common-mode feedback (G/sub M/) circuitry. The filter operates from a single 5 V power supply and dissipates 200 mW. The simulated signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equals 70 dB for an input range of 1 V/sub pp/. The advantages of the proposed approach include on-line tuning, simpler circuitry by eliminating the master filters and CMF circuits as well as reduced power, noise and die area. >"
1924238,21220,8494,Low-power short-channel single-ended current-steered CMOS logic-gate for mixed-signal systems,2008,"Low-power CMOS logic circuits operated from a fixed supply voltage can result in uncontrolled conduction over process and temperature variation. Large current-pulses flowing during the logic transitions also cause power-supply noise. Current steered logic known as CSL can mitigate these problems. Here, a fixed bias-current is steered between two distinct paths during the transition between logic states. Constant supply-current eliminates switching noise on the power supply line. The current-biased circuit presented here operates like a normal CMOS gate preserving many of its desirable properties. The key modification is that the output static-voltage of the gate is used to steer the bias current between two paths. During the transition the bias current is used for pulling-up the output node. During the pull-down phase a small local capacitance is charged to provide the current pulse needed for pull-up. The current source resistance in conjunction with the local decoupling capacitor acts as a bypass for the impulse current needed for quick pull-up. This new circuit operates over a wide range of bias currents and, the corresponding speeds vary proportionately. These current-steered CMOS gates (CS- CMOS) are specially targeted for use in low-power, wide dynamic range mixed-signal applications where supply noise must be minimized. Circuit operation and simulation results are presented."
2111125,21220,8494,A fuzzy neural network based adaptive predictor with P-controller compensation for lossless compression of images,2009,"Predictively encoded techniques are commonly used for lossless compression of images for its effectiveness of removing statistical redundancy between pixels. However, there can be large prediction errors for pixels around boundaries. In this paper, we introduce techniques commonly used in control systems to enhance the coding efficiency of predictive coding. Actually, the predictive coding system behaves just like a multi-input single-output system with the predictor itself can be taken as the system model. When compared with the purpose of a control system, which is to follow the system command as precisely as possible, we find the objective of both systems are the same. Moreover, an edge or a boundary among image pixels can be regarded as a step command in control systems. These observations lead to the idea of using control technologies to improve prediction result for pixels around boundaries. To realize this idea, we use an adaptive Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network (TS-FNN) as the predictor. Furthermore, the widely used proportional controller in control system is implemented implicitly in the consequent part of the network so that the prediction error can be further compensated for pixels around boundaries. We find in experiments that the proposed approach can have a very good prediction result even without using any online training area for network adaptation process. This makes the proposed system more feasible under limited resources. Finally, comparisons to existing state-of-the-art lossless predictors and coders will be given to highlight the advantages of the proposed novel approach."
1280631,21220,8494,MMSE-QR factorization systolic array design for applications in MIMO signal detections,2010,"Complex-valued QR factorization is a fundamental but computationally intensive operation commonly used in various MIMO signal detection algorithms. In this paper, a novel factorization scheme based on Givens rotations and symmetrical nullification was devised. The proposed scheme successfully integrates the MMSE criterion into factorization and can achieve better BER performance. Instead of working on a complex-valued domain, the scheme starts with a block-wise symmetric real-valued matrix counterpart. By exploiting the symmetrical property, the proposed scheme effectively reduced almost half of the computing complexity. Based on the presented scheme, a novel systolic array design featuring fully parallel and deeply pipelined processing was developed subject to the EWC 802.11n recommendation. Architecture optimization measures such as look-up table (LUT) free CORDIC implementations and hardware sharing among scaling operations were employed to minimize the hardware design complexity. Post layout simulation results using TSMC 0.18|xm process indicate the proposed design, with a gate count of 233K and a maximum clock rate of 120 MHz, can admit a new 4×4 complex matrix for MMSE based factorization in every 8 clock cycles (66.7ns)."
601616,21220,8494,Error resilient hybrid variable length codec with tough error synchronization for wireless image transmission,2001,"Variable-length codes, also called Huffman code, is the most popular data compression technique used for solving channel bandwidth bottleneck in many image compression standards such as JPEG, MPEG-2, and H263. But, it is vulnerable to loss of synchronization if they are transmitted consecutively through a noisy channel. It will result in large drops in image quality. Previously, we have proposed a novel HVLC coding scheme, which exhibits high synchronization, error correction capability and low redundancy. Simulation results show that it can achieve high signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR=28 dB) compared to existed VLC schemes at bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -3/ environment. Here, we present HVLC codec system. It can support up to 256-entry 12-bit symbol table. The codec system provides advanced options and fully programmable for pixel-based and DCT-based image coding algorithm. Based on 0.35 um CMOS SPQM technology, the codec system occupies a silicon area of 3400 um/spl times/3400 um and consists of 88,000 gate count.

2318758,21220,8494,Behavioural modeling and simulation of a switched-current phase locked loop,2005,"Switched-current (SI) methods can provide an effective route to the implementation of analog IC functionality using a standard digital CMOS process. Further, adopting an SI architecture can lead to equivalent performance but with a significantly reduced area compared to switched capacitor structures. The use of behavioural modeling and simulation at a structural and building block level has allowed architectural exploration and evaluation to be carried out on novel topologies based on this approach. The result is an integrated design flow that uses behavioural models to test the performance of the circuit, leading directly to a synthesized structural model that can be verified using a common design platform. This has the obvious benefit of reducing the full custom analog design effort required when developing topologies and building blocks for new processes. We describe the design approach for a phase locked loop (PLL) based on a novel SI architecture using behavioural models written in VHDL-AMS. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the design at a high level and are used to optimize the behaviour of the loop response with regard to design specifications. The modeling approach is explained. The advantage of using behavioural models is highlighted. The resulting simulations are consistent with transistor level simulation results, but several orders of magnitude faster. The resulting design achieves a performance that is comparable with designs using current techniques, but with significantly reduced area."
1996018,21220,8494,Combined Linear Prediction and Subspace Based Blind Equalizers,2007,"A novel hybrid linear prediction (LP) and subspace decomposition based blind equalization algorithm, based on second-order statistics, is proposed in this paper. Previous blind equalization algorithms based on subspace decomposition and LP methods have problems when the channel order is under/over estimated. Previous subspace based algorithms exhibit significantly higher residual output mean square error if the estimation of channel length is off even by one, (Tong et al., 1994), (Li and Fan, 2000). In a practically noisy environment, accurate rank determination may be difficult. Even the linear prediction algorithms (Slock, 1994), (Liavas et al., 2000) are not robust to order over-estimation because solving the Yule Walker equation requires the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the noise free correlation matrix, for which the theoretical rank of the noise-free correlation matrix needs to be known. If the channel order is over-estimated, some of the small eigen-values (corresponding to noise) are erroneously classified in the signal subspace and are then inverted, and the LP algorithms exhibit large mean square errors (Liavas et al., 2000). In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid linear prediction and subspace based blind equalization algorithm. The superior performance of subspace based methods in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is thus integrated into our method. Our algorithm is robust to channel order under/over estimation. Our algorithm is a data based (as opposed to channel based) algorithm and avoids effects of channel estimation errors. Simulations clearly indicate that our algorithm performs very well under channel order under/over-estimation, when LP and subspace based blind equalizers fail."
532972,21220,8494,An overlap-contention free true-single-phase clock dual-edge-triggered flip-flop,2015,"Dual-edge-triggered (DET) synchronous operation is a very attractive option for low-power, high-performance designs. Compared to conventional single-edge synchronous systems, DET operation is capable of providing the same throughput at half the clock frequency. This can lead to significant power savings on the clock network that is often one of the major contributors to total system power. However, in order to implement DET operation, special registers need to be introduced that sample data on both clock-edges. These registers are more complex than their single-edge counterparts, and often suffer from a certain amount of clock-overlap between the main clock and the internally generated inverted clock. This overlap can cause contention inside the cell and lead to logic failures, especially when operating at scaled power supplies and under process variations that characterize nanometer technologies. This paper presents a novel, static DET flip-flop (DET-FF) with a true-single-phase clock that completely avoids clock overlap hazards by eliminating the need for an inverted clock edge for functionality. The proposed DET FF was implemented in a standard 40nm CMOS technology, showing full functionality at low-voltage operating points, where conventional DET-FFs fail. Under a near-threshold, 500mV supply voltage, the proposed cell also provides a 35% lower CK-to-Q delay and the lowest power-delay-product compared to all considered DET-FF implementations."
1918680,21220,8494,An efficient spatial prediction-based image compression scheme,2000,"An efficient spatial prediction-based progressive image compression scheme is developed in this paper. The proposed scheme consists of two phases, namely, the prediction phase and the quantization phase. In the prediction phase, information of the nearest neighbor pixels is utilized to predict the center pixel. Next in-place processes are taken, i.e., the resulting prediction error is stored in the same memory location as the predicted pixel. Thus, the temporary storage space required is significantly reduced in the encoding process as well as decoding process. The prediction scheme generates prediction error images with hierarchical structure, which can employ the result of many existing quantization schemes, such as EZW and SPIHT algorithms. As a result, a progressive coding feature is obtained in a straightforward manner. In the quantization phase, we extend the multilevel threshold scheme. Not only the pixel intensity value itself but also level significance is taken into account. In the experimental testing, we illustrate that the proposed scheme yields compression quality advantages. It outperforms several existing image compression schemes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be realized by only integer addition and shift operations. Tremendous amounts of computation-saving are achieved. The above features make the proposed image compression scheme beneficial to the areas of real-time applications and wireless transmission in limited bandwidth and low computation power environments."

The circuit transformer feedback and the unique Q-enhancement technique facilitate increased voltage swing across the resonator and subsequent linearity improvement. The filter has a measured center frequency, f o , of 2.14 GHz, a maximum gain of 5 dB (~10dB unbuffered), and a tunable Q of 3 to 29.

In this paper, we develop a quantitative analysis for ongoing assessment of cognitive response by investigating the neurobiological brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments. A single-trial event-related-potential (ERP)-based fuzzy neural network (FNN) is applied to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic-light events. The system consists of a dynamic virtual-reality (VR)-based motion simulation platform, EEG signal detection and analysis units, and FNN-based classifier. ICA algorithms are used to obtain noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A novel temporal filter is also proposed to solve time-alignment problems of ERP features and PCA is used to reduce feature dimensions, which were then fed into a FNN classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that organize operators' cognitive responses to task events. Comparisons of three kinds of linear and nonlinear classifiers show that our proposed FNN-based classifier can achieve a satisfactory and superior recognition rate (85%). The classification results can be further transformed as the control/biofeedback signals of intelligent driving systems."

An 80×80 image pixel array is fabricated in 0.5 μm 3M2P standard CMOS technology, occupying 3×3 mm 2  silicon area. The proposed imager enables various operational modes, including 1) event generator mode, 2) motion tracking mode and 3) video output mode in full-resolution or compression by region of interest (ROI). An ultra low power focal-plane motion detection block, consisting of analog memory and dual-threshold comparator, is integrated in the pixel-level circuit for on-chip motion detection. A hardware-friendly motion tracking algorithm is developed that indicates ROIs according to a strategy based on the detection results. A 12-bit on-chip, off-array ADC is employed to convert the captured light intensity into digital readouts. In order to further reduce the power consumption, lower image resolution is used under the first two modes. A trade-off analysis between the image resolution and detection accuracy is proposed in this paper. In simulation, the total power consumption is 10μW at a frame rate of 30fps and a supply voltage of 3.3V in motion tracking mode.

1801321,21220,8494,Characterizing fast-scale instability in a buck-based switching amplifier for wideband tracking,2008,"This paper provides a first exploration of fast-scale stability borders for switching power converters operating as wideband switching amplifiers. Such operation is required in audio amplifiers, envelope trackers in polar RF transmitters and line drivers for Power Line Communications. A buck converter with output voltage proportional feedback in a signal tracking configuration with a sinusoidal reference is considered (Figure 1). The work first characterizes the effect of the classical set of parameters used in regulation stability analysis (output resistance, reactive components, switching frequency, feedback gain), and considers the output voltage to cover the complete dynamic range and hence disappear as a variable in the parametric space. Complementarily, the effect of the ratio of the tracking or baseband frequency to the switching frequency is added as a new variable in the design space indicative of wideband tracking operation. Characterization tools encompass families of time domain simulations as dynamic bifurcation diagrams for the time-varying reference. The paper concludes by exploring the effect of momentarily losing fast-scale stability upon the output signal spectrum, since applications such as adaptive supply of RF power amplifier are subject to strict spectral masks."
1809675,21220,8494,Phase measurement and adjustment of digital signals using random sampling technique,2006,"This paper introduces a technique to measure and adjust the relative phase of on-chip high speed digital signals using a random sampling technique of inferential statistics. The proposed technique as applied to timing uncertainty mitigation in the signaling of a digital system is presented as an example; the relative phase information is used to minimize the timing skew. The proposed circuit captures the state of the signals under measurement simultaneously at random instants of time and gathers a large sample data to estimate the relative phase between the signals. By carefully premeditating the sample size, the accuracy and confidence of the result can be set to a level as high as desired. Accurately sensed value of relative phase enables the correction circuit to reduce the maximum correction error, less than half the maximum delay resolution unit available for adjustment. A pure standard cell based circuit design approach is used that reduces the overall design time and circuit complexity. The test results of the proposed circuit manifest a very close correlation to the simulated and theoretically expected results. The random sampling unit (RSU) circuit proposed for phase measurement in this paper occupies 3350 (/spl mu/m)/sup 2/area in 130nm technology, which is an order of magnitude smaller than what is required for its analog equivalent in the same technology."
2548917,21220,8494,A novel operating-point driven method for the sizing of analog IC,2011,"It is known that the operating-point driven (OPD) analog sizing methods have clear advantages compared with the sizing methods of directly using transistor width and length as the decision variables. However, new analog sizing algorithms using OPD technique in modern technologies have seldom been reported in recent years. One of the main reasons is that with the scaling down of the technologies, the transistor models are much more complex, which makes the available DC root solving algorithms and the look-up-table-based methods face significant challenges on accuracy, efficiency and memory requirements. Instead of solving the equations to find the width of transistors, interpolating in a pre-constructed look-up-table, or using regression methods, a novel method, called on-line interpolation operating-point driven (OIOPD), is proposed. OIOPD finds the width of the transistor by the interpolation of the width-current curve with already determined length and voltage biases. The lower and upper points to decide the interpolated value are generated by on-line simulations using the two extreme values of the width in a technology. Experimental results in 0.25µm, 0.18 µm and 90nm technologies show that OIOPD has 10 times improvement on accuracy, 300–1100 times improvement on efficiency compared with the available methods. In addition, no extra memory (e.g. the memory to save the look-up table) is needed. These advantages make OIOPD suitable for operating-point driven analog sizing methods in modern technologies. A practical analog sizing example using OIOPD is also provided."

Compatible with low-voltage requirements, the generator can operate at even lower V DD  supply voltages. Following a transition on PV IN  from 3V to 6V, a reduction of 76% and 50% on line regulation occurs as compared to PWM approaches with a fixed ramp and with voltage feedforward using an integrator with a differential pair in saturation, respectively."
1309721,21220,9078,A 2014 Mbin/s deeply pipelined CABAC decoder for HEVC,2014,"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the latest video standard that specifies video resolutions up to 8K Ultra-HD (UHD) at 120 fps to support the next decade of video applications. This results in high throughput requirements for the Context Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) entropy decoder, which was already a well-known bottleneck in H.264/AVC. Several modifications were made to the HEVC CABAC to address the throughput challenges. This work leverages these improvements in the design of a high throughput HEVC CABAC decoder. The proposed design uses a deeply pipelined architecture to achieve a high clock rate. Additional techniques such as state prefetch logic, latched-based context memory, and separate finite state machines are applied to minimize stall cycles, while multi-bypass bins decoding is used to further increase the throughput. The design is synthesized in a IBM 45nm SOI process, and achieves throughputs up to 2014 and 2748 Mbin/s under common and worst-case test conditions, respectively, at 1.9 GHz operating frequency. The results show that the design is sufficient to decode video bitstreams in real-time at Level 6.2, or at Level 6.0 for applications requiring sub-frame latency."
1853405,21220,8494,Spatial-temporal consistent labeling for multi-camera multi-object surveillance systems,2008,"For an intelligent multi-camera multi-object surveillance system, object correspondence across time and space is important to many smart visual applications. In this paper, we propose a temporal and spatial consistent labeling algorithm for this demand. In the algorithm, an object corresponding database records the temporal and spatial consistency information for each segmented mask. With the database, the object-mask correlations are propagated through the propagation rules by analyzing mask splitting/merging conditions. In the spatial consistent labeling method, the homography warping and the earth mover's distance are adopted to match same objects across different views. The earth mover's distance solves the double matching problem, allows the algorithm to work normally under a small deviation of detected object locations, and makes pairing results have minimum global matching distances. The concept trusting-former- pairs-more is also adopted to avoid frequent pair switching if two objects are too close. The correct spatial labeling rate is about 89.25% in average. For online processing applications, the algorithm need not trace back to the past frames. The overall processing speed is about 10.24 frame per second (fps) with CIF size video running on a 2.8GHz general purpose CPU."
2832708,21220,8494,Extended exploration of low granularity back biasing control in 28nm UTBB FD-SOI technology,2016,"Recently, we proposed a low-granularity back-bias control technique [1] optimized for the ultra-thin body and box (UTBB) fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) technology. The technique was preliminary evaluated through the design of a low-voltage 8-bit ripple carry adder (RCA), showing very competitive energy and delay values. In this paper, the characteristics of the low-granularity back-biasing control are explored considering as benchmarks basic logic gates as well as adders with different bit lengths. All the designed circuits were compared to their equivalent dynamic threshold voltage MOSFE T (DTMOS) and conventional CMOS designs. The higher efficiency of low granularity body bias control is emphasized by the single well layout strategy, offered by the 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI technology, thus leading our approach to achieve competitive silicon area occupancy along with significant performance and energy improvements. More precisely, postlayout simulations have demonstrated that circuits designed according the suggested strategy, can achieve a delay reduction of 33% compared to conventional CMOS designs, whereas the energy consumption can be reduced down to 46% compared to DTMOS solutions, for a supply voltage of 0.4V. These results were obtained while maintaining robustness against process and temperature variations."
1738172,21220,8494,History and future of auditory filter models,2010,"Auditory filter models have a history of over a hundred years, with explicit bio-mimetic inspiration at many stages along the way. From passive analogue electric delay line models, through digital filter models, active analogue VLSI models, and abstract filter shape models, these filters have both represented and driven the state of progress in auditory research. Today, we are able to represent a wide range of linear and nonlinear aspects of the psychophysics and physiology of hearing with a rather simple and elegant set of circuits or computations that have a clear connection to underlying hydrodynamics and with parameters calibrated to human performance data. A key part of the progress in getting to this stage has been the experimental clarification of the nature of cochlear nonlinearities, and the modelling work to map these experimental results into the domain of circuits and systems. No matter how these models are built into machine-hearing systems, their bio-mimetic roots will remain key to their performance. In this paper we review some of these models, explain their advantages and disadvantages and present possible ways of implementing them. As an example, a continuous-time analogue CMOS implementation of the One Zero Gammatone Filter (OZGF) is presented together with its automatic gain control that models its level-dependent nonlinear behaviour."
641812,21220,8494,A micropower analog VLSI processing channel for bionic ears and speech-recognition front ends,2003,"Next-generation bionic ears or cochlear implants will be fully implanted inside the body of the patient and consequently have very stringent requirements on the power consumption used for signal processing. We describe a low-power programmable analog VLSI processing channel that implements bandpass filtering, envelope detection, logarithmic mapping and analog-to-digital conversion. A bionic ear processor may be implemented through the use of several such parallel channels. In a proof-of-concept 1.5 /spl mu/m AMI MOSIS implementation, the most power-hungry channel of our system (7.5 kHz center frequency) consumed 7.8 /spl mu/W of power, had an internal dynamic range (IDR) of 51 dB, and provided 64 discriminable levels of loudness per channel. Such numbers already satisfy the requirements of today's commercial bionic ear processors and can lower the power consumption of even advanced DSP processing schemes of the future by an order of magnitude. Our processing channel is also well suited for use in low power speech recognition front ends, which commonly require the same sequence of operations in cepstrum-like front ends. Future improvements in the interfaces between the various stages of our processing channel, which were not optimized in this implementation, promise a potential internal dynamic range of more than 60 dB with little or no increase in power."
1905193,21220,8494,A multiplication-accumulation computation unit with optimized compressors and minimized switching activities,2005,"A low-power multiplication-accumulation computation (MAC) unit using the radix-4 Booth algorithm is proposed; its architectural complexity is reduced and switching activities are minimized. However, to maintain a high performance, the critical delays and hardware complexities of MAC units are explored to derive a MAC unit with high performance and low hardware complexity. A carry-save addition operation with optimized compressors is proposed to omit the use of half adders to reduce the hardware complexity further. A scheme to reduce switching activity is also proposed to lower the power consumption of the MAC unit. In performing a MAC for X/spl times/Y+Z, the effective dynamic ranges of X and Y are detected; the one with the smaller effective dynamic range is processed for Booth decoding so as to increase the probability of the partial products being zero, and thus the switching activity is reduced. Also, the effective dynamic range of the result from this multiplication is estimated and compared with the effective dynamic range of the datum, Z. The larger effective dynamic range of the two data is considered as the effective word length for an addition operation. Pipelined latches are used to make the noneffective operation maintain the status of the previous operation so as to reduce the switching activities from the addition performed in MAC. After the addition operation, sign extension is performed on the result from the effective sign bit copied to non-effective bits to derive at a correct output datum. Compared to conventional MAC units, the proposed one is able to reduce 21.09% to 43.74% of power consumption. Additionally, the proposed MAC unit outperforms conventional ones in comparing the product of critical delay, area, and power consumption."

The software is hosted on a free-soft-core processor from Xilinx FPGA (PicoBlaze); while two novel arithmetic circuits serve as the hardware environment to perform multi-precision arithmetic and scalable reduction. The proposed design is capable to work over a suite of curves recommended by NIST, namely, m= 163, 233, 283, 409, 571 without reconfiguring either the software or hardware. The proposed architecture is parameterized for data widths 8, 16, 32 bit to evaluate performance versus area trade-offs. The implementation of the scalable ECC processor consumes only 452 (58 %) and 559 (72%) slices of the lowest cost chips from Xilinx Spartan III namely XC3S50 for 8 and 16-bits data paths, and 1127 (60%) slices for 32-bit data path on Spartan III XC3S200.

1261551,21220,8494,Run-time mapping of applications on FPGA-based reconfigurable systems,2010,"The role of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FP-GAs) in System-on-Chip (SoC) design considerably increased in the last few years. Their established importance is due to the large amount of hardware resources they offer, as well as to their increasing performance, and furthermore to the support for reconfigurability. Even though FPGAs seem to have reached their maturity, there is still a lack of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools able to deal with dynamic reconguration. Existing algorithms aim at optimizing the performance of a set of applications, basing the computation on classic metrics (such as communication overhead), while reconfiguration-related issues are not taken into consideration. This work proposes a design methodology to map several applications on the FPGA area at run-time. Starting from a basic solution found at design-time for the initial set of applications, the proposed algorithm makes it possible to map a new application (not known at design-time), both minimizing the number of synthesis processes and optimizing the on-chip performance of the new application. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve up to a 18% reduction in the number of reconfigurations with respect to an off-line static-mapping approach, while generally preserving the performance of the executed applications on the FPGA."

To cope with the non-uniform nature in optic field of Z-motion, we compute the correlation between one set of output of retinal sensors and the delayed output of the other set of far-end sensors at progressive increasing distances across the chip for motion and velocity detection. Sweeping the correlation delay value in one signal path of the correlator, the chip can indicate the strongest correlation when the correlation delay is tuned to match the actual velocity. Behavior-level MATLAB simulations have been performed to successfully validate the functionality of the proposed motion detection method using expanding or contracting motion images that are incurred from an out-bound or in-bound moving object at a constant Z-velocity. The proposed motion sensor consists of 1448 sensor pixels placed on thirty-two evenly spaced divergent axes with 25 correlator outputs on each axis. Z-motion and velocity detection is performed based on the maximum likelihood (ML) detection using the 25 correlators output of all 32 axes.

This system supports the simultaneous transmission of 32 channels of broadband data sampled at 30 kSps, 12 bit/sample, using FSK modulation on a 3.95 GHz carrier, with a link range extending over 20 m. The channel rate is 24 Mbit/s and the bit stream includes synchronization and error detection mechanisms. The power consumption, approximately 142 mW, is low enough to allow the system to operate for about two days, using two 3.7 V / 1100 mAh Li-Ion battery packs. The transmitter was designed using off-the-shelf components and is small enough to fit on a printed circuit board with 20 cm 2 .

667330,21220,8494,Design for cold test elimination - facing the Inverse Temperature Dependence (ITD) challenge,2012,"Historically, circuits that operate in a high-temperature region could cause an increase in the total delay (td) especially in the process technology prior to the 90nm node. This was because both interconnects and transistors were slowing down as the temperature rose. However, for transistors with the 90nm process technology and beyond, this phenomena has started to change. In particular, the threshold voltage, V t , to supply voltage, VCC, ratio of high-V t  cells in a library is now very close to 1. As a result, the consequence of this event is called an Inverted Temperature Dependence (ITD) effect. There are two key parameters that determine the transistor temperature behavior. They are the mobility, μ, and the threshold voltage, V t . Both decrease with an increasing temperature. This new, complicated dependence of delay vs. temperature poses new challenges to circuit designers. This paper describes the physics behind the ITD effect on the design of modern, nanometer VLSI circuits. We also provide a case study that demonstrates a new ITD effect compensation feature. This new design approach will produce an outgoing level of quality that minimizes the risk of eliminating the cold test elimination (CTE) in the manufacturing. The elimination of cold test will help improving manufacturing capacity for optimized cycle time and product delivery. Hence, this new ITD design breakthrough has been proliferated to the recent process technology nodes."
606440,21220,8494,Dynamic single phase logic with self-timed stages for power reduction in pipeline circuit designs,2001,"True single phase clock logic techniques, e.g. with alternating arranged Nand P-logic cells, yield easily to design circuits with standard cells and high speed potential. The disadvantages are a difficult clock tree design and high power consumption. To realize every logic function, dual rail or differential styles are chosen which increase clock load. This paper presents a method to speed up dynamic single clock circuits. The advantage of asynchronous logic is that the critical path delay is the sum of only the evaluation times of the single logic blocks without wasting time for waiting, latches, or redundant logic. Therefore, this work assembles small asynchronous chains of dynamic logic blocks into one period of the global clock to minimize the unused time per clock cycle (AC-TSPC). However, the synchronous single phase clocking scheme is maintained. The advantages of this method are shorter latencies for calculations, power reduction by smaller clock trees and no need for latches, and a simpler clock distribution network due to increased clock skew tolerance. The results of the simulations of an 8/spl times/8 bit multiplier in TSPC and in AC-TSPC show an enhancement in power-reduction of 40% for the logic and of 89% for the clock tree with a latency reduction of 40% and more in comparison with TSPC."
2413203,21220,8494,ADAPTO: full-adder based reconfigurable architecture for bit level operations,2008,"Low cost microprocessors and DSPs are optimized to perform general arithmetic and logic operations on native wordlength. On the other hand, the efficiency decreases when they process shorter data (more clock cycles per operation are required). Recently different solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem. Among those, the one based on a main processor with a reconfigurable unit (RU) used as coprocessor (to speed up fine grained operations) is the most common. Typically those coprocessors, similar to FPGA, are composed by look-up tables (LUTs) and pass transistors interconnects. In this way, due to the great number of reconfiguration bits, it is impossible to obtain together a run-time reconfiguration and an efficient implementation, avoiding idle hardware resources . This paper proposes a new dynamic reconfigurable architecture that can be embedded in microprocessors or low cost DSPs to accelerate the execution of the above mentioned operations. The goal of ADAPTO (adder-based dynamic architecture for processing tailored operators) is to reduce the hardware complexity and the reconfiguration time, with respect to typical LUT based reconfigurable array. ADAPTO supports both hardware reconfiguration and instruction execution in the same processor clock cycle. This goal has been obtained by using a new reconfigurable unit based on full adders, instead LUTs, and simplifying the network interconnect."

The paper also proposes an array architecture based on a shielded current routing bus that allows for a single measurement circuit to be shared by all the sensor pixels without compromising performance. This eliminates the need for individual pixel calibration. Each sensor pixel comprises 6 minimum size digital transistors, enabling high density integration. The sensor employs a 3-phase clocking scheme that enables gain tuning and also limits output voltage offsets. The paper presents data obtained from 5 chips fabricated in a commercially available 2- poly, 3-metal, 0.5 mum CMOS technology, each of them comprising individual circuits measuring the substrate-coupling capacitances of metal3 electrodes of varying sizes. The test data indicates successful sensor operation with a maximum sensitivity of 126 mV/fF, a maximum achievable resolution of 14 aF and an output dynamic range of 69.4 dB."
1475586,21220,8494,Live demonstration: Multiple-timescale plasticity in a neuromorphic system,2013,"I. Demo Description Traditionally, neuromorphic ICs have integrated only reduced subsets of the rich repertoire of plasticity seen in biological preparations [1], [2]. The focus with respect to long term plasticity has been mostly on Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) [1]. Several ICs have also implemented forms of presynaptic short term dynamics, which filter synaptic pulse input, but have no influence on other timescales of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an IC that implements short-term-, long-term-, and metaplasticity in an integrated way following [3], where these three different timescales interact to form the overall weight at the synapse. Fig. 1 shows an example presynaptic pattern with depression and the membrane trace as input for learning [3]. The resulting analog weight state shows the influence of presynaptic depression in the step increases, comparable to [1]. Also, different settings for the learning threshold exhibit a bias towards weight increase/decrease on a metaplastic (i.e. slow) timescale similar to [2]. The overall setup features several Maple-ICs of each 16 neurons and 512 of the above synapses, interlinked via FPGA-based pulse transmission. This allows network sizes of up to 200 neurons, sufficient to demonstrate the necessity for this type of learning for a range of computational neuroscience models."
2036667,21220,8494,Sensor array for multiple emission gas measurements,2005,"The paper presents a low-cost multiple gas sensing device developed for pollution measurements in a kitchen hood which is exposed to grease and dirt. The target application of an ozone control system needs no accurate measurements. Using common electronics for all three sensing elements reduces costs. A single digital processor with a user friendly interface controls the heating power of the sensing elements and reads the measurements. Two sensors can be connected to a single personal computer (PC). The main task of the sensor system is to observe volatile organic compounds (VOC) from cooking emissions and measure the ozone produced in the outlet duct. The sensor gives the total non-specific VOC amount and is not intended for a particular gas. Calibration with ethanol guarantees a representative enough response for most hydrocarbons in cooking emissions. The sensing devices give an indication if more ozone is needed. Practical tests show that the response of the first VOC element is slow but stable, while the second one reacts rapidly (<1 s) to any changes. The combination of the sensing elements gives a very good estimate of the total VOC level. The ozone sensing element also reacts to VOCs, which is a harmful characteristic for the prospective ozone control mechanism. However, with a combination of the VOC and ozone measurements, the errors in the ozone measurement can be reduced. Thus the sensor is like a simple electronic nose (Marco, S. et al., 1998)."
448073,21220,8494,Bandwidth limits in PWM switching amplifiers,2006,"PWM buck switching power converters are good candidates for high efficiency power amplification of arbitrary band-limited signals. The correlation between the signal bandwidth and the switching frequency, in turn related to switching losses, imposes practical limits for high bandwidth applications. Stringent specifications appear in such applications as audio amplifiers (kHz signal bandwidths), and lately, in fast envelope tracking power amplifiers (MHz signal bandwidths) for the Envelope Elimination and Restoration technique in polar RF power amplification. Bandwidth limitations in PWM amplifiers are explored in this work by proposing design criteria for obtaining the switching frequency to signal bandwidth ratio (f/sub s//f/sub x/) so as to guarantee a given aliasing error. To achieve that purpose, PWM spectra are reviewed for single tone, two-tone and multitone signals. Subsequently, by taking into account the analogy between PWM and FM spectra, bandwidths around the switching frequency are estimated by extending Carson's rule to an arbitrary error. This allows obtaining an extension of the Nyquist criterion for pulse-width modulation. System-level simulation results are reported to validate the analysis, showing that the conventional f/sub s//f/sub x/ factor used in the power converter design field might be too conservative."

The stimulator employs two current-based digital-to-analog converters (DACs), one each for anodic and cathodic phases, with binary-weighted transistors and 2b-programmable least-significant bit (LSB) currents. The biphasic, cathodic-leading, stimulus current pulse amplitude is 5b-programmable in four ranges of ∼ 12–341μA, 23–682μA, 32–992μA, and 42–1,300μA. A low-power (∼10μW), active charge balancer monitors the site voltage after each stimulus cycle and, if necessary, injects positive or negative current pulses via two 3b auxiliary DACs to bring the site voltage back within a userset safety window. All digital circuitry operate from 3.3V, whereas the stimulator output stage operates from 5V with a stimulus site common-mode voltage of 3.3V for better use of the available voltage headroom in cathodic-leading, single-supply stimulation.

1788297,21220,8494,A clockless ultra low-noise low-power wireless implantable neural recording system,2008,"Sharp digital transitions cause interference in low-noise mixed-mode IC designs. This issue is quite significant during clock transitions, which drive tens to thousands of gates depending on the complexity of the system. Many remedies have been proposed ranging from physical layout designs to shifting signal spectrum. However, nothing would probably be more effective than rooting the problem out by eliminating the clock itself. In this paper, we present a clockless ultra low-noise 4-channel wireless implantable neural recording system based on time division multiplexing (TDM) of pulse width modulated (PWM) signals with minimum substrate noise and interference. We have utilized a modified integrating ADC scheme to both sample and modulate the analog input channels while managing the switching times such that no switching occurs during sensitive sampling onsets. We have also reduced size and power consumption of the chip by the digitization circuitry to the receiver side. The chip has been implemented in the AMI 0.5-mum CMOS, occupying 0.81 mm 2  and consuming 4.8 mW at +1.5 V when all channels are active.

Vibration-based energy harvesting on the nano scale has also received attention. In this paper, we characterize the nonlinear dynamical behavior of a strained nanostructured graphene for its potential use in energy harvesting applications. A compressed vibrating membrane graphene sheet free from any external excitation is first studied. We present a continuous time dynamical model of the system in the form of a double-well single degree of freedom system. Equilibrium points are obtained and their stability analysis is carried out. Then, random vibrations are considered as the main ambient energy source for the system and its performances in terms of the well occupation zones, RMS value of the position, and the corresponding energy harvested are presented in the steady state non-equilibrium regime when the noise level is considered as a control parameter. From this model, nonlinear analysis is carried out by computing state space trajectories, probability density and FFT spectra under a deterministic excitation. The ultimate goal of this parameter space exploration based upon a behavioral model is to provide design-oriented guidelines for engineering graphene-based mechanical harvesters."

By virtue of their nanoscaled size and their tunable conductance, memristors are key elements to emulate high-density networks of biological synapses that regulate the communication efficacy among neurons and implement learning capability. We propose a TiN/ HfO2/Ti/TiN memristor as artificial synapse for neuromorphic architectures. The device can gradually change its conductance upon application of proper electrical stimuli. More specifically, it features gradual potentiation and depression when stimulated by trains of identical potentiating or depressing spikes, which are easy to be implemented on-chip. Moreover, we demonstrate that the memristor conductance can be regulated according to the delay time between two spikes incoming to the device terminals. This regulation of memristor conductance implements the typical biological learning process named Spike-Time-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP). Finally, collected STDP data were used to simulate a simple fully connected Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for pattern recognition."
2076178,21220,8494,Image forensic of glare feature for improving image retrieval using Benford's Law,2011,"Whilst it is sometimes essential that a scene is well lit before image capture, too much light can cause exposure or glare-based problems. Typically, glare is introduced to images when the camera is pointed towards the light source, and results in a visible distortion in the image. In this paper, we analyse and identify images that contain the ‘glare’ property using the empirical Benford's Law. The experiment is performed on 1338 images, and extracts discrete wavelet High High (HH), High Low (HL) and Low High (LH) sub bands as raw data. The significant digit from each coefficient of all sub bands is then calculated. We then analyse the probability of occurrence of large digits against smaller digits to detect anomalies. All images containing these anomalies are further analysed for the identification of additional salient features. This analysis is performed in accordance with the Benford's Law plot and the help of probability intensity histogram and divergence. Our results indicate that 142 images have irregular Benford's Law curves. For most images, the irregularity occurs at the 5 th  digit. After visual examination, we have found the unbalanced light and high level of brightness in these images. To measure the intensity of light in an image, we compute the probability histogram of gray levels. These results also correlate with the irregular peak identified from the Benford's Law curves. In addition, the divergence is then computed, which shows the deviation between the actual Benford's Law curve and the Benford's Law graph of an image. Our proposed technique is novel and has a potential to be an image forensic tool for quick image analysis."
1603531,21220,8494,A single bit memory per pixel time domain DPS using multi-reset integration scheme,2010,"In this paper, a compact time-domain Digital Pixel Sensor (DPS) is proposed. The Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) based sensor employs a multi-reset integration scheme enabling sequential acquisition of high resolution (8-bit) light intensity while using only a single pixel memory. The proposed multi-reset integration method reduces the memory requirements at the pixel-level, without impacting the pixel encoding resolution, as only one bit memory per pixel is required compared to the eight bits memory in conventional pixel architecture. As a consequence, both the pixel size and the fill factor are significantly improved. A near-optimal timing control unit coupled with a linearization circuit is proposed in order to limit the timing penalty incurred by the proposed integration method enabling to maintain high frame rates. A 64×64 sensor array was fabricated using AMS 0.35μm CMOS technology. A pixel size of 23µm × 21µm with a fill factor of 23% is achieved, resulting in over 75% reduction in terms of pixel size and doubling the pixel fill-factor as compared to a conventional 8-bit DPS. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme while achieving a dynamic range higher than 100 dB as well as good linearity of the Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) response."
1119031,21220,8494,A decoding algorithm with reduced complexity for non-binary LDPC codes over large fields,2013,"Non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes outperform their binary counterparts in some cases, but their high decoding complexity is a significant hurdle to their applications. In this paper, we propose a decoding algorithm with reduced computational complexities and smaller memory requirements for NB-LDPC codes over large fields. First, a simplified algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of variable node processing. To reduce memory requirements, existing NB-LDPC decoders often truncate the message vectors to a limited number n m  of values. However, the memory requirements of these decoders remain high when the field size is large, since n m  needs to be large enough to alleviate error performance degradation. In this paper, an improved trellised based check node processing algorithm is proposed to significantly reduce the memory requirement. The number of elements in a variable-to-check message is reduced to n v  (n v   m ). The sorted log likelihood ratio (LLR) vector of a check-to-variable message is approximated using a piece-wise linear function. Thus, only few LLRs are stored and other LLRs are computed on-the-fly when needed. For each a priori message, most LLRs are approximated with a linear function. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed decoding algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.

The aims of this research are to 1) introduce a dry and wireless EEG system used for conveniently recording EEG signals from forehead regions, 2) propose an effective system for processing EEG recordings and translating them into the vigilance level, and 3) implement the proposed system with a JAVA-based graphical user interface (GUI) for online analysis. To validate the performance of the proposed system, this study recruited eight voluntary subjects to participate a 90-min sustained-attention driving task in a virtual-realistic driving environment. Physiological evidence obtained from the power spectral analysis showed that the dry EEG system could distinguish an alert EEG from a drowsy EEG by evaluating the spectral dynamics of delta and alpha activities. Furthermore, the experimental result of the comparison of the prediction performance using four forehead electrode sites (AF8, FP2, FP1, and AF7) implied that a single-electrode EEG signal used in the mobile and wireless EEG system is able to obtain a high prediction accuracy (~93%). Taken together, the proposed system applied a dry-EEG device combined with an effective algorithm can be a promising technology for real driving applications."

1955924,21220,8494,"Design, Analysis and Implementation of Integrated Micro-Thermal Control Systems",2007,"While there has been a growing emergence of circuit designs for the life sciences, there is an important issue that remains largely unaddressed. Although advanced design techniques have been applied to circuits capable of measuring very small amplitude, high signal to noise ratio signals, with many custom circuit designs for these applications (Harrison and Charles, 2003), there remains a proverbial elephant in the room. The systems used to measure these signals provide no means of accurate thermal control. This is especially surprising considering the huge dependance in the behavior of both biological and electrical systems upon temperature. In fact, the vast majority of electrical cellular assays are performed on dying cells! We present a systematic method of incorporating a high-accuracy, closed-loop thermal feedback system into hybrid systems for the life sciences. We introduce a thermal stabilization chip containing a heater and PTAT temperature sensor including the heater control circuit. We then provide a description of the PID control loop. This is followed by both computational data via finite element analysis and empirical data that assesses the thermal performance of the chip. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the system with comparative results of cell culture."

Common mode feedback has been utilized to guarantee the amplifier functionality by forcing the output DC level to a desired voltage. A switch is added to the output to achieve fast settling time in case the amplifier is saturated. The amplifier has been implemented in the AMI 1.5-mum 2M2P standard CMOS process and occupies 0.201 mm 2  on chip. The amplifier current consumption is 8 muA at plusmn1.7 V supply, with two measured AC gains of 39.3 dB and 45.6 dB. The low cutoff frequency is 4-bit programmable from 0.015 Hz to 700 Hz. The high cutoff frequency can be adjusted from 120 Hz to 12 kHz at negligible load and 40 Hz to 4 kHz with a 2 pF active probe loading. The measured input referred noise is 3.6 muV over 20 Hz ~ 10 kHz.

Our research aims to improve the convenience and mobility of EEG recording by eliminating the need for conductive gel and creating sensors that fit into a scalable array architecture. The EEG dry-contact electrodes are created with micro-electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) technology. Each channel of our analog signal processing front-end comes on a custom-built, dime-sized circuit board which contains an amplifier, Alters, and analog-to-digital conversion. A daisy-chain configuration between boards with bit-serial output reduces the wiring needed. A system consisting of seven sensors is demonstrated in a real- world setting. Consuming just 3 mW, it is suitable for mobile applications. The system achieves an input-referred noise of 0.28 muVrms in the signal band of 1 to 100 Hz, comparable to the best medical-grade systems in use. Noise behavior across the daisy-chain is characterized, alpha-band rhythms are detected, and an eye-blink study is demonstrated."
2102793,21220,8494,On Model Parameter Estimation for H.264/AVC Rate Control,2007,"We present an idea of improving the rate quantization (R-Q) model based rate control for H.264/AVC from a novel model parameter estimation perspective. Our idea is different from the conventional belief that emphasizes the statistical accuracy property of an R-Q model. Instead, in our opinion, a good R-Q model should also balance the model accuracy with dynamic properties such as the predictability of its model parameter. This new angle is important for two primary reasons: First, due to the non-stationary nature of video signals, deviation from the assumptions for an R-Q model is almost inevitable. Second, for timing-sensitive applications, model parameters are not known in advance and thus have to be estimated on the fly where estimation errors cannot be avoided. We found that compared to the quadratic R-Q model (Lee et al., 2000), while the linear R-Q model is a bit less accurate when the statistical data is known, its model parameter has much better predictability and faster to estimate. Taking advantage of these nice properties of the linear R-Q model, the rate control for H.264/AVC yields significantly better rate distortion performance than that of JM 10.2 reference software where the quadratic R-Q model is used. The PSNR improvement is up to 0.63 dB and about 0.40 dB on the average for our test sequences. Furthermore, the proposed rate control achieves the target bit rate much more accurately"
409157,21220,8494,CNN in drug design — Recent developments,2015,"We describe a method for construction of specific types of Neural Networks composed of structures directly linked to the structure of the molecule under consideration. Each molecule can be represented by a unique neural connectivity problem (graph) which can be programmed onto a Cellular Neural Network. The idea was to translate chemical structures like small organic molecules or peptides into a self learning environment which is CNN based. In the case of small molecules, each cell of the CNN stands for one atom of the molecule under consideration. But in contrast to the standard CNN architecture where each cell is connected to the neighboring cells, only those cells of the feature net are connected for which there also exists a chemical bond in the molecule under consideration. This implies that the feature net topology varies from molecule to molecule. In the case of peptides, the amino acids that form the building blocks of the peptide are reflected by the CNN cells wherein the amino acid sequence defines the network topology. Unlike the standard CNN used for image processing, there are no input values like the input image that are fed into the feature net. Instead, all information about the input molecule is supplied to the feature net by means of the topology. The output of several feature nets is fed into a supervisor neural network which computes the final output value. The combination of several feature nets and a supervisor networks constitutes the Molecular Graph Network (MGN). The designed networks are used for selection of molecules representing wanted properties such as activity against specific diseases, interactions with other compounds, toxicity etc. and possibly being candidates to be tested further as new drugs."
1309530,21220,23735,Low-latency localization by active LED markers tracking using a dynamic vision sensor,2013,"At the current state of the art, the agility of an autonomous flying robot is limited by its sensing pipeline, because the relatively high latency and low sampling frequency limit the aggressiveness of the control strategies that can be implemented. To obtain more agile robots, we need faster sensing pipelines. A Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a very different sensor than a normal CMOS camera: rather than providing discrete frames like a CMOS camera, the sensor output is a sequence of asynchronous timestamped events each describing a change in the perceived brightness at a single pixel. The latency of such sensors can be measured in the microseconds, thus offering the theoretical possibility of creating a sensing pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the platform. However, to use these sensors we must rethink the way we interpret visual data. This paper presents a method for low-latency pose tracking using a DVS and Active Led Markers (ALMs), which are LEDs blinking at high frequency (>1 KHz). The sensor's time resolution allows distinguishing different frequencies, thus avoiding the need for data association. This approach is compared to traditional pose tracking based on a CMOS camera. The DVS performance is not affected by fast motion, unlike the CMOS camera, which suffers from motion blur."
2304181,21220,369,An ultrawideband system architecture for tag based wireless sensor networks,2005,"With the latest improvements in device size, power consumption, and communications, sensor networks are becoming increasingly more popular. There has also been a great increase in the popularity of commercial applications based on ultrawideband (UWB). Impulse radio (IR) based UWB technology utilizes noise-like signal, has potentially low complexity and low cost, is resistant to severe multipath, and has very good time domain resolution allowing for location and tracking applications. In this paper, the architecture and performance of a noncoherent low complexity UWB impulse radio based transceiver designed for low data rate, low cost sensor network applications is presented. The UWB-IR transmitter is based on a delay locked loop (DLL) and UWB monocycle pulse generator. The UWB-IR receiver utilises a noncoherent, energy detection based approach, which makes it largely independent of the shape of the transmit waveform and robust to multipath channels. The test circuits are designed for 0.35 /spl mu/m SiGe BiCMOS technology. This paper presents system simulations results as well as the performance of key functional blocks of the designed UWB application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) transceiver architecture. The simulated power consumption of UWB-IR transceiver circuits is 136 mW with 100% duty cycle with a 3.3 V power supply."
2280369,21220,8494,High performance solution for interfering UWB piconets with reduced complexity sphere decoding,2004,"The sphere decoding (SD) algorithm has been widely recognized as an important algorithm to solve the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) problem, given that symbols can only be selected from a set with a finite alphabet. The complexity of the sphere decoding algorithm is much lower than the directly implemented MLD method, which needs to search through all possible candidates before making a decision. However, in high-dimensional and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases, the complexity of sphere decoding is still prohibitively high for practical applications. In this paper, a simplified SD algorithm, which combines the K-best algorithm and SD algorithm, is proposed. With carefully selected parameters, the new SD algorithm, called SD-KB algorithm, can achieve very low complexity with acceptable performance degradation compared with the traditional SD algorithm. The low complexity of the SD-KB algorithm makes it applicable to the simultaneously operating piconets (SOP) problem of the multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplex (MB-OFDM) scheme for the high-speed wireless personal area network (WPAN). We show in particular that the proposed algorithm provides over 4 dB gain in bit error rate (BER) performance over the baseline MB-OFDM scheme when several piconets interfere with each other. The SD-KB algorithm can provide pseudo-MLD solutions, which have significant performance gain over the baseline method, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. The cost of performance improvement is a higher complexity. However, the new SD algorithm has predictable computation complexity even in the worst scenario."
770406,21220,8494,Energy saving controlling chaos,2012,"An energy saving control of unstable periodic orbits embedded in a hybrid chaotic system is proposed. The conventional controlling chaos methods utilize small perturbations of states or parameters as control input, however, quick time responses cannot be expected since the corresponding basins of attractions for higher periodic solutions become tiny. While If one allows a large perturbation to improve the time response, rather the total controlling energy which is proposed to the distance between the target orbit and the current orbit may increases. In this paper, when we consider the chaotic hybrid system, we noticed that we could utilize the perturbation of the referenced value for controlling, i.e., only a threshold value (Poincare mapping surface) is updated in control. No control input as a perturbation of the state or parameter value is applied to the system. In fact, the threshold value is used instantly when the feedback system determines the next updated threshold value. The variation of the threshold value can be obtained numerically by computing variational equations, and the control matrix is designed with the linear control theory. Since no affection to the state and parameters, it is emphasized that the total behavior of the controlled system is different from the conventional methods, especially it is unlike the impulsive control methods. We demonstrate this control method in a simple hybrid system and show that a large basin of attraction for the control is realized."
1034597,21220,8494,Image processing and vision techniques for smart vehicles,2012,"The idea of safe and smart vehicles has been thoroughly researched over the past decades to ensure drivers' safety from possibly dangerous situations. This paper presents a brief review of different applications of image processing and computer vision techniques in smart vehicles. To detect other on-road vehicles, researchers have approached the problem from various angles; with solutions ranging from active sensors like radar to passive sensors like cameras. Recently, researchers are working to create a panoramic 360 degree view of the vehicle's environment by merging different images from sides, rear and front of the car using passive sensors. There has also been work on constructing high resolution images from low cost, low resolution cameras, in order to reduce final cost of the system. In this paper, we have presented a new algorithm for mono-camera based vehicle detection systems, by incorporating different low level (edges) and high level features (Bag-of-features). To extract edge information flawlessly, we presented a new edge detection method, namely Difference of BiGaussian (DoBG). Experimental results show average 98.5% recognition rates, which is one of the best results achieved so far."
1599342,21220,8494,Advances in non-radiative resonant inductive coupling wireless Power Transfer: A comparison of alternative circuit and system models driven by emergent applications,2014,"Recent research in wireless power transfer (WPT) using resonant inductive coupling has demonstrated very high efficiencies at large distances compared to the transmitting element dimensions, thereby increasing the number of potential applications of WPT. Since resonant inductive coupling is a very multidisciplinary field of research, different approaches have been proposed to predict the behaviour of these systems from the physical theory of resonators (coupled-mode theory) and circuit theory. Although the equivalence of these models for a point-to-point link has already been studied together with the performance metrics Power Transferred to the Load (PTL) and Power Transfer Efficiency (PTE), the new challenges and applications of this technology emphasize the necessity of analytical models to predict and assess the behavior of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) links. In this article we revisit the current analytical models from the MIMO perspective, derive the analytical equations for the equivalent performance metrics PTE and PTL and demonstrate how to maximize them in a non-radiative resonant wireless power transfer link from a circuit-centric point of view, providing design guidelines in terms of optimal source and load impedances. This work concludes with a prospective discussion on open challenges of WPT. © 2014 IEEE."
2527020,21220,8500,An inductively powered scalable 32-channel wireless neural recording system-on-a-chip for neuroscience applications,2010,"We present an inductively powered 32-channel wireless integrated neural recording (WINeR) system-on-a-chip (SoC) to be ultimately used for one or more small freely behaving animals. The inductive powering is intended to relieve the animals from carrying bulky batteries used in other wireless systems, and enables long recording sessions. The WINeR system uses time-division multiplexing along with a novel power scheduling method that reduces the current in unused low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) to cut the total SoC power consumption. In addition, an on-chip high-efficiency active rectifier with optimized coils help improve the overall system power efficiency, which is controlled in a closed loop to supply stable power to the WINeR regardless of the coil displacements. The WINeR SoC has been implemented in a 0.5-μ m standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process, measuring 4.9×3.3 mm 2  and consuming 5.85 mW at ±1.5 V when 12 out of 32 LNAs are active at any time by power scheduling. Measured input-referred noise for the entire system, including the receiver located at 1.2 m, is 4.95 μV rms  in the 1 Hz~10 kHz range when the system is inductively powered with 7-cm separation between aligned coils."
2169878,21220,8494,A study of encoding and decoding techniques for syndrome-based video coding,2005,"In conventional video coding, the complexity of an encoder is generally much higher than that of a decoder because operations, such as motion estimation, consume significant computational resources. Such a codec architecture is suitable for a broadcast downlink transmission model. However, in contemporary applications of mobile wireless video uplink transmission, it is desirable to have a low complexity video encoder to meet the resource limitations on mobile devices. Recent advances in distributed video source coding provide a potential reverse in computational complexity for encoder and decoder (Puri, R. and Ramchandran, K., 2002; Aaron, A. and Girod, B., 2003). Various studies are done within the context of a scheme that is similar in spirit to that of Aaron and Girod. We conduct a study of encoding and decoding techniques for syndrome-based video encoding schemes for mobile wireless applications. Our innovation is the adoption of low resolution low quality reference frames for motion estimation at the decoder. To accomplish the goal of reducing computational complexity while maintaining good reconstruction quality at the decoder, we investigate the following related strategies: (1) compression of low resolution and low quality sequences; (2) rate-distortion study with complexity constraints at the encoder; (3) building enhanced evidence for a syndrome decoder. Extensive experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of these techniques for syndrome based video coding."
1809200,21220,8494,Novel Sparse OBC based Distributed Arithmetic Architecture for Matrix Transforms,2007,"Inner product (IP) forms the basis of a number of signal processing algorithms and applications such as transforms, filters, communication systems etc. Distributed arithmetic (DA) provides an effective methodology to implement IP of vectors and matrices using a simple combination of memory elements, adders and shifters instead of lumped multipliers. This bit level rearrangement results in much higher computational efficiencies and yields compact designs highly suited for high performance resource constrained applications. Offset binary coding (OBC) is an effective technique to further optimize the DA, and allows us to reduce the memory requirements by a factor of two, with minimum additional computational complexity. This makes OBC-DA attractive for applications that are both resource and memory constrained. In addition, sparse matrix factorization techniques can be exploited to further reduce the size of the DA-ROMs. In this paper, the design and implementation of a novel OBC based DA is demonstrated using a generic architecture for implementing discrete orthogonal transforms (DOTs). Implementation is performed on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro field programmable gate array (FPGA), and a detailed comparison between conventional and OBC based DA is presented to highlight the trade offs in various design metrics including performance, area and power."
2045258,21220,8494,A low-complexity image compression algorithm for Address-Event Representation (AER) PWM image sensors,2011,"In Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) image sensors the incident light intensity is represented by the timing of pulses. Exceptionally high dynamic range (DR) and improved signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) have been demonstrated for this class of image sensors. Unfortunately, their spatial resolution is limited by the need of an in-pixel memory to record the timing information. The AER protocol is an attractive method for removing this overhead, since pixel trigger events can be sent as address vectors, and in-pixel data memories are no longer required. Regrettably, the need to send address vectors can place an increased burden on the communication channel and will limit the array resolution, frame-rate, and image quality. In this paper, we present a low-complexity AER Block Compression (AERBC) algorithm which exploits the statistically ordered nature of AER pixel arrays. The address vector overhead can be dramatically reduced under this scheme. Only 0.0625 comparisons and 0.125 subtractions are performed for each pixel, and on average 30.82 dB PSNR can be achieved at 1.0 bit-per-pixel code rate. A general strategy is also developed here to optimize AERBC parameters so a balance between performance and hardware resources can be reached."
1035624,21220,369,Partial Noise Value Aided Reduced K-Best Sphere Decoding,2013,"This article focuses on reducing the complexity of K-best sphere decoding (K-best SD) algorithm for the detection of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. One common reduction method is that one or more selected thresholds are set to cut excess nodes with partial Euclidean Distance (PED) larger than them. For a long time, statistical characteristic of noise has been well explored to generate thresholds. But the known noise in a certain specific transmission process is always overlooked. In this article, not only the statistical characteristic of noise is calculated, but also the known value of noise is considered. By adding a parameter determined by both noise and quality of service (QoS) to the smallest PED in each searching layer, a tighter and more suitable threshold can be calculated for this layer. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm makes an efficient complexity reduction while the performance drops little. Specially, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity about 90\% while the bit error ratio (BER) performance drops around 10\% in 4-by-4 MIMO systems employing 16-QAM or 64-QAM modulation. A new parameter, half complexity point, is proposed to evaluate the reduction effect, and half complexity points of the proposed algorithm are better than one selected original algorithm."
1752753,21220,9078,Linear adaptive search range model for uni-prediction and motion analysis for bi-prediction in HEVC,2014,"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the up-to-date video coding standard. Compared to the predecessor H.264/AVC, HEVC can further reduce approximately 50% bit rate on average with the competing perceptual quality. On the other hand, experiment shows that HEVC requires more than 4 times computational complexity during the encoding procedure. In ours test, even using fast TZSearch, integer motion estimation (IME) still accounts for 20%–30% of encoding time. In this paper, we propose two adaptive search range (ASR) algorithms to address this problem in IME. First, we present an ASR algorithm based on linear adaptive search range model (LAM-ASR) for uni-prediction. This model considers the impacts of the motion consistency, PU size and the amplitude of motion vector predictor (MVP). In order to offer more flexibility, we introduce a scale factor to this model. Second, for bi-prediction, we propose another ASR algorithm based on motion analysis (MA-ASR), which assigns different search range to PU by making full use of the motion information obtained from uni-prediction. Experimental results show that when embedded into the fast TZSearch method of the reference software, the two proposed ASR algorithms can averagely save 42.0% of the IME time with 0.023dB BD-PSNR degradation or equally 0.7% BD-BR increase."
638737,21220,8494,A novel software architecture for computer-aided analysis of circuits with uncertain parameters,1999,"In recent years interest has grown in the possibility of applying novel software technologies (such as those from artificial intelligence) to the field of scientific calculus. There is an increasing need of such approaches due to the requests for integration-cooperation features in modern applications, whose simulation tasks are asked to go far beyond the rigid application of presumed general purpose numerical methods. In this paper we explore the use of software agents for circuit-CAD (CCAD) with uncertainty handling capabilities. In such a field, solving some hard problems like tolerance and sensitivity analysis (TSA) for strongly nonlinear circuits in presence of large parameter uncertainties, benefits much more from a clever preliminary choice of the best problem-tuned numerical method rather than from a blind number crunching approach. Software agents seem to meet these constraints while introducing a high degree of flexibility, which enables the implementation of dynamic adaptive resolution schemes for given CCAD tasks. We present an example of use of the proposed architecture utilizing Java to specify agents as active objects. Some applications of the new strategy to TSA circuit-related problems are presented."

2156255,21220,8494,Novel integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory,2012,"NAND flash has been scaled down intensively to 2Y nm generation to satisfy the increasing demand for high-density memories. However, as technology node advances, various scaling barriers newly appeared and reliability characteristics of NAND flash such as endurance and data retention deteriorated. Maximum Vth of a programmed cell becomes lower with scaling down, resulting in insufficient program window for MLC operation. Floating gate (FG) and inter-poly dielectric (IPD) structure must be carefully optimized to maximize saturated level of programmed Vth. The tight control of Vth distribution is one of the main issues in scaling for reliability margin. By decreasing depletion in floating gate and control gate (CG), widening of cell Vth distribution width can be efficiently suppressed. The effect of traps in gate oxide to reliability increases with the decrease in cell dimension. To lower interface trap of gate oxide, hydrogen reducing back-end-of line (BEOL) process is introduced. By using new BEOL process, endurance and data retention characteristics are drastically enhanced. In this paper, we will present the major scaling issues and integration technologies for improving reliability in NAND flash memory for 2Ynm generation and beyond."
336870,21220,8494,Comparison of low-power biopotential processors for on-the-fly spike detection,2015,"Spike detection is a signal processing technique that can enable significant data rate reduction and resource savings in wireless brain monitoring. In these systems, energy-efficient spike detection algorithms are sought for enabling realtime signal processing while consuming low-power. As several spike detectors are based on ASIC, FPGA or low-power microcontroller unit (MCU), such algorithms must add little overhead to the entire system, while ensuring low error rate. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three different spike detection algorithms targeted toward implementation into low-power resource-constrained electronic systems. As practical validation, all candidate algorithms have been implemented on a popular low-power MCU and were fully characterized experimentally using previously recorded neural signals with different signal-to-noise ratios. A cost function based on detection rates, execution times, power consumption and resource utilization have been created and employed for comparing the detectors. The performances of all candidates are reported, and the best detector is identified. All candidate detectors present detection rate above 95% at high SNR, and above 78% for low SNR and can reduce the power consumption by up to 22.7%. This paper is the first to demonstrate the performances and hardware limitations of spike detectors on a low-power MCU system."

The circuit performance is targeted towards use in direct conversion receivers, where a high IP2 is required. The LNA operates in sub-1 GHz applications reaching frequencies as low as 50 MHz, as it is required by IEEE 802.22 standard. The topology proposed here is based on the resistive-feedback inverter with a cascaded auxiliary amplifier to implement noise canceling. This cascaded amplifier is composed by a common-source (CS) amplifier and a very linear buffer at the output of the cascade. The high IP2 is obtained by a proper transistor biasing and by combining diodes with the load of the amplifiers with the highest non-linearity. This topology also works as a balun to comply with single-ended input from antennas and differential mixers as output loads. The post-layout simulations included bondwire inductances and pad capacitances parasitics. The results show a bandwidth of 50 MHz–1 GHz, voltage gain > 18 dB, NF < 3.8 dB, Sn < −13 dB and maximum IP2 of 38 dBm. The LNA power consumption is just 6.7 mW, excluding pad buffers."
778766,21220,8494,Another look at the retina as an image scalar quantizer,2010,"We investigate, in this paper, the processing of stimuli in the mammalians retina, and raise the analogy between the biological mechanisms involved and already existing analog-to-digital converters functioning. Besides, we propose a possible decoding procedure for the retina neural code under the restrictions of the model presented. The coder/decoder, we describe here, focuses on the temporal behavior of the three last retina layers. As time goes, our system gradually changes from a quasi-uniform quantizer to a highly non-linear one. Besides, high magnitude stimuli are well refined, while small magnitudes are coarsely approximated. This yields an original bioinspired quantization system, the behavior of which evolves dynamically during the time interval of stimuli observation. Here, we present a biologically realistic retina model adapted to a temporal signal. Then, we explore the input/output map of the system and its ability to recover the original signal. Further, we make the parallel between this bioinspired system and well known compandor/quantizer systems used for analog-to-digital converters. Finally, we compare the performance of our quantizer to the dead zone uniform scalar quantizer used in JPEG2000, and show a slightly better behavior for low rate transmissions."
1322658,21220,8494,SRAM in hold-operation: Modeling the interaction of soft-errors and switching power-supply noise,2012,"SRAM failure-rate, induced by failure mechanisms such as process variations or cosmic neutrons, increases with reduction in the supply-voltage. Thus, appropriate supply-voltage margins must be used to mitigate or control the failure-rate. This work models and analyzes the interaction of two failure-mechanisms in an SRAM cell during the hold-operation (standby): (i) power-supply noise (due to switching at clock-edge) and soft-errors (due to radioactivity). Circuit-level simulations are used to analyze this interaction. The effect of random process-variations is accounted for by Monte-Carlo simulations. An error in stored-bit of SRAM cell is a transient phenomenon. Therefore, transient analysis of soft-error is carried out in the presence of power-supply noise and random process-variations by using circuit-level simulations in the UMC CMOS 90nm technology. A stochastic process based supply-voltage is difficult to model; therefore, a lower-envelope of measured supply-voltage from the literature is used as the noisy waveform. The critical-charge, obtained by using injection-current model of Freeman [1], of an SRAM cell is used to calculate the soft-error rate (SER). Simulation results show that the SER depends on the time-average of the noisy supply-voltage and not on its minimum value. The distribution of critical-charge, due to random process-variations, is estimated using simulations."

The proposed neural front-end integrates low noise instrumentation amplifiers, low-power filter stages with configurable gain and cut-off frequencies, a successive approximation register (SAR) ADC, and a realtime compressed sensing processing unit. A capacitor coupled instrumentation amplifier integrated input impedance boosting has been designed, dissipating 1μA quiescent current. An input referred noise of 1.63μV was measured in the frequency band of 1Hz to 7kHz. The noise efficiency factor (NEF) of the amplifier is 0.76. The SAR ADC achieves an ENOB of 10.6-bit at a sampling rate of 1MS/s. A compressed sensing processing unit with configurable compression ratio, up to 8x, was integrated in the design.

696627,21220,8494,A CMOS micro-power wideband data/power transfer system for biomedical implants,2003,"This paper presents a low power wideband data/power transfer system for fully implantable medical devices such as a cochlea implants. Generally, low-power data/power transfer systems have two modes of operation; Power transfer and data transfer. Unlike recently reported low-power data/power transfer schemes in which data is transmitted separately from power [1], in this implementation, power and data are transmitted together via an inductive link. Using on/off keying with PWM Modulation enables continuous power transfer irrespective of the data being transmitted. Also the clock is extracted from the PWM envelope, making an on-chip clock generation circuit unnecessary. Measured results on a test chip show worst case PWM data discrimination of 10%, making a tighter encoding scheme possible. The proposed system is tuneable via a single bias current from 1 kHz to 2 MHz modulation frequency making it suitable for a wide range of low power unidirectional communication systems. The experimental Power Supply immunity was as large as /spl plusmn/15% for V/sub DD/=4 V. Although the fabricated chip was not optimised for low power, it only consumed 16 /spl mu/W for a bias current of 160 nA@50 kHz on a standard CMOS process. A more recent optimised version of the chip consumes only about 3 /spl mu/W of power."
428263,21220,8494,A novel wideband DOA estimation technique based on harmonic source model for a uniform linear array,2004,"Wideband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem has attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to its practical importance in many important areas. In this paper, a wideband DOA technique is proposed. This technique is based on two main ideas: (i) the correlation between the sensor measurements of a uniform linear array (ULA) and a sine or cosine waveform with known frequency forms a sequence that may be regarded as a sinusoidal signal with multiple frequencies associated with the time delays of all the sources; (ii) the DOA estimation can then be cast into a frequency estimation problem that may be solved by utilizing the AR model of a sinusoidal signal. The DOAs are identified by a grid search based on the estimated AR model. The new technique may be applied to both incoherent as well as coherent real-valued sources of harmonic or nonharmonic nature. Furthermore, the method does not require the use of the computationally intensive singular value decomposition (SVD) operation and the a priori knowledge of the number sources. It has been demonstrated through extensive simulations that the proposed technique is advantageous compared to the other commonly used techniques, such as the incoherent wideband MUSIC (IWM) and the coherent steered covariance matrix (STCM) based methods."
396917,21220,8494,Measurement and SPICE prediction of sub-picosecond clock jitter in A/D converters,2003,"We propose an innovative characterization technique that allows us to discriminate noise contributions due to jitter from other phenomena (voltage reference and substrate noise, high-amplitude effects) in A-to-D converters. The jitter estimated with this method closely matches that inferred from the signal-to-noise ratio at high input frequencies, where noise is dominated by the aperture uncertainty. At the sub-picosecond level required for the 14-b high-IF ADC under test, any off-chip disturbances substantially affect the accuracy of the measurement. In order to characterize the uncertainty, first the phase noise spectrum of the external clock source is measured and converted into jitter by way of a rigorous formula. Then, the timing ambiguity associated with the on-chip clock pre-amplification and distribution circuitry is simulated via standard Spice techniques, providing results in agreement with experimental evidence. The paper provides tools to isolate the main noise sources in the clock circuit, and optimize it for low jitter in the early simulation phase. Moreover, it arms the designer with a robust yet easy experimental method to assess the jitter value, and interpret the SNR data gathered from test silicon."
2166065,21220,8494,Switched-capacitor based implantable low-power wireless microstimulating systems,2006,"The main objective of this paper is to introduce a new category of implantable wireless microstimulators based on discharging a series of small capacitors to inject quantized lumps of electric charge into the excitable tissue, namely switched-capacitor based micro-stimulators (SCS). In this method, the total amount of charge per stimulation phase can be controlled by changing the initial and final capacitor voltages as well as the number of capacitors being discharged. The rate of discharge, which is the stimulus current, is also a controllable parameter that adds more flexibility to this stimulation approach, while improving the implant safety. The key reason for adopting SCS in implantable low-power devices was to combine the power efficiency of the voltage-controlled stimulators (VCS) with the safety and stimulation parameter controllability of the current-controlled stimulation (CCS) circuits. In addition, the SCS technique substantially simplifies the microstimulator architecture, and depending on the application, can potentially reduce the implant size and power requirements. It also provides an opportunity to apply different stimulus waveforms to the excitable tissue that can be more efficacious in activating the surrounding nerve or muscle fibers compared to the commonly used square-shaped pulses."
1081468,21220,23735,"Event-based, 6-DOF pose tracking for high-speed maneuvers",2014,"In the last few years, we have witnessed impres-sive demonstrations of aggressive flights and acrobatics using quadrotors. However, those robots are actually blind. They do not see by themselves, but through the “eyes” of an external motion capture system. Flight maneuvers using onboard sensors are still slow compared to those attainable with motion capture systems. At the current state, the agility of a robot is limited by the latency of its perception pipeline. To obtain more agile robots, we need to use faster sensors. In this paper, we present the first onboard perception system for 6-DOF localization during high-speed maneuvers using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Unlike a standard CMOS camera, a DVS does not wastefully send full image frames at a fixed frame rate. Conversely, similar to the human eye, it only transmits pixel-level brightness changes at the time they occur with microsecond resolution, thus, offering the possibility to create a perception pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the robot. We exploit these characteristics to estimate the pose of a quadrotor with respect to a known pattern during high-speed maneuvers, such as flips, with rotational speeds up to 1,200◦/s. Additionally, we provide a versatile method to capture ground-truth data using a DVS."

The front-stage instrumentation amplifier (IA) features a chopper; an AC-coupler and a novel chopper notch filter for minimizing the dc-offset; transistors' flicker noise and 50Hz powerline interference concurrently. A noise-aware transistor selection (thin- and thick-oxide) in the IA enables a flexible tradeoff between noise and input impedance performances. The 2 nd  stage is a spike filter clocked by a parallel use of two non-overlapping clock generators, effectively tracking and suppressing the chopper spikes. The last stage is a gain-bandwidth-controllable amplifier for boosting the gain and alleviating different bio-potential signal measurements through simple digital controls. Simulation results showed that the RFE is capable of tolerating a differential electrode offset up to ±50mV, while achieving 140dB CMRR and 51.4nV/√Hz inputreferred noise density. The notch at 50Hz achieves 41dB rejection. The entire RFE consumes 16.55 to 35.5µA at 3V."
513281,21220,8494,Down-sampling based embedded compression in video systems,2015,"With rapid increase of image resolution in modern video processing and display systems, the bandwidth and power consumption of external memory are becoming serious bottlenecks. This problem can be alleviated by high-fidelity embedded compression (EC) techniques for video frame buffers. Classic lossless or near-lossless coding methods like CALIC are ill suited for embedded systems due to their high complexity. In this work, a new, simple infra-frame EC technique based on downsampling and side-information aided upsampling is developed. Through a study of a family of downsampling schemes, an optimal one is found and analyzed for EC. This downsampling scheme gives birth to the new EC technique. The main idea is to first split an image into blocks, and then adaptively choose different down sampling patterns and upsampling methods to code/decode these blocks. For a memory bandwidth reduction of 60%, the proposed EC system can achieve PSNR above 40dB, while allowing very simple, low-cost real-time hardware realization. A noteworthy novelty of this work is compression without entropy coding. The resulting code stream is of fixed-rate, supporting random access to pixel blocks."

The sensor combines an asynchronous, data-driven pixel circuit with an on-chip precision time-stamp generator and a 3-stage pipelined synchronous bus-arbiter. With a temporal resolution of down to 100ns, corresponding to a line rate of 10MHz, the sensor is ideal for high-speed machine vision tasks that do not rely on conventional image data. The output data rate depends on the dynamic contents of the target scene and is typically orders of magnitude lower than equivalent data output produced by conventional clocked line sensors in this type of applications. 120dB dynamic range makes high-speed operation possible at low lighting levels or uncontrolled lighting conditions. The sensor features two parallel pixel lines with a line separation of 250mum and a pixel pitch of 15mum. A prototype was fabricated in a standard 0.35mum CMOS technology. Results on high-speed edge angle resolution and edge gradient extraction as well as wide dynamic range operation are presented."
1016172,21220,8494,A pure software ldpc decoder on a multi-core processor platform with reduced inter-processor communication cost,2012,"As an error correction code, Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code has been widely used in various communication standards such as WiMAX and DVB-S2. But these continuously-evolving communication standards and the high development cost and low-flexibility of hardwired ASIC solutions have pushed LDPC researchers to turn to more cost-efficient and flexible implementation, and thus the multi-core processor based implementation of LDPC decoder is gaining increasing attention in the last few years. However, the performance of the multi-core processor based implementation is far below the hardwired ASICs, with one of the key reasons that the cost of communication between processors is very high. Three approaches are proposed in this paper to reduce the communication cost, including: optimized algorithm partitioning to reduce communication traffic, utilizing imbalanced communication between tasks to optimize mapping and reduce overall communication distance, and simplified data sending-receiving mechanism to reduce the cost of identifying received data. By using these approaches, the communication time of the proposed implementation of LDPC decoder only accounts for 12.2% of total decoding time, which generally occupies 50% decoding time in the previously reported LDPC decoders on multi-core processors. And our work can achieve better throughput performance under the same hardware condition compared with other state-of-the-art works."
2499236,21220,8494,Cycle slipping in nonlinear circuits under periodic nonlinearities and time delays,2015,"Phase-locked loops (PLL), Costas loops and other synchronizing circuits are featured by the presence of a nonlinear phase detector, described by a periodic nonlinearity. In general, nonlinearities can cause complex behavior of the system such as multi-stability and chaos. Even if the phase locking is guaranteed for any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit can still be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error caused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e.g. to demodulation and decoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error oscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits extremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in this direction, available in the literature, focus on the phase jitter and cycle slipping under random noise and examine the relations between the probabilistic characteristics of the noise and of the phase error, e.g. the expected number of slipped cycles. At the same time, cycle slipping occurs also in deterministic systems with periodic nonlinearities, depending on the initial conditions, properties of the linear part and the periodic nonlinearity and other factors such as delays in the loop. In the present paper we give analytic estimates for the number of slipped cycles in PLL-based systems, governed by integro-differential equations, allowing to capture effects of high-order dynamics, discrete and distributed delays. We also consider the effects of singular small-parameter perturbations on the cycle slipping behavior."

The cochlea senses and separates sound in a nonlinear active fashion, exhibiting remarkable sensitivity and frequency discrimination. Although several electronic models of the cochlea have been proposed and implemented, none of these are able to reproduce all the characteristics of the cochlea, including large dynamic range, large gain and sharp tuning at low sound levels, and low gain and broad tuning at intense sound levels. Here, we implement the Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators (CAR) model of the cochlea on an FPGA. CAR represents the basilar membrane filter in the Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast-Acting Compression (CAR-FAC) cochlear model. CAR-FAC is a neuromorphic model of hearing based on a pole-zero filter cascade model of auditory filtering. It uses simple nonlinear extensions of conventional digital filter stages that are well suited to FPGA implementations, so that we are able to implement up to 1224 cochlear sections on Virtex-6 FPGA to process sound data in real time. The FPGA implementation of the electronic cochlea described here may be used as a front-end sound analyser for various machine-hearing applications."
2892132,21220,8494,"A tunable, robust pseudo-resistor with enhanced linearity for scanning ion-conductance microscopy",2016,"Fast and high-resolution scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) experiments require a high speed, low noise and low distortion transimpedance amplifier (TIA) as interface circuit. Recent high performance TIAs utilize capacitive feedback. However, their inability to treat DC currents renders them unfavorable for SICM applications and resistive TIAs remain the best choice here. To address this problem, this paper presents an active MOS resistor with improved robustness and linearity to make it suitable for its use as feedback resistor in TIAs for SICM experiments. The presented device features PMOS transistors operating in weak inversion as pseudo-resistors to obtain reduced noise compared to ohmic resistors of the same value. A novel bias circuit is introduced which compensates process variations of the pseudo-resistor. Monte Carlo simulation shows a standard deviation of 3.6 % of the overall resistance. The connection of multiple pseudo-resistors in series, while preserving equal overall resistance, linearizes the I-V characteristic and decreases the total harmonic distortion to 0.26 %. The presented device is incorporated into a low noise and high speed TIA achieving a simulated SNDR of 49 dB over a bandwidth of 1 MHz enabling fast high-resolution topography imaging using SICM."

The brain processes these data using networks of neurons that communicate by asynchronous spikes, a technology that is dramatically different from conventional electronic systems. We report here a step towards constructing electronic systems with analogous performance to the brain. Our VLSI spiking neural network combines in real-time three distinct sources of input data; each is place-encoded on an individual neuronal population that expresses soft Winner-Take-All dynamics. These arrays are combined according to a user-specified function that is embedded in the reciprocal connections between the soft Winner-Take-All populations and an intermediate shared population. The overall network is able to perform function approximation (missing data can be inferred from the available streams) and cue integration (when all input streams are present they enhance one another synergistically). The network performs these tasks with about 80% and 90% reliability, respectively. Our results suggest that with further technical improvement, it may be possible to implement more complex probabilistic models such as Bayesian networks in neuromorphic electronic systems."
301334,21220,8494,The algebra of system design: A Petri net model of modular composition,1993,"A mathematically-based CAD system is being designed. The system will have a predicate logic theorem prover at its core, and will mirror every surface-level design step with an internal proof-step. Verification proofs will be byproducts of the design process: that is, circuits designed in this system will already be proven to be correct implementations of their specifications. However, an insistence that everything be expressed in pure predicate logic is as frequently obfuscating as it is clarifying: some aspects of circuit requirements and design descriptions cannot easily be expressed in logic. Allowing different expressions to infiltrate the proof-based CAD environment could destroy the mathematical integrity of the system. To protect the system while allowing more flexible descriptions, different models were used for expressing and reasoning about different requirements. The framework for the safe integration of these various models is a general-purpose composition algebra. The authors impart some of the flavor of the algebra by describing the mathematics; presenting a simple gate-level example; and, principally, by working through a relatively substantial Petri Net example. The Petri net example demonstrates that some important aspects of hardware specification and design that can only be expressed with great difficulty in other formal models of concurrency can be expressed almost effortlessly in the algebra. >"
2335992,21220,8494,Method and architecture design for motion compensated frame interpolation in high-definition video processing,2009,"In this paper, a novel, fast, and low complexity method is proposed for motion compensated frame interpolation (MCFI). Unlike previous works involving high complexity and complicated time-consuming iterations, the proposed method adopts one-pass and low-complexity approach without any repeated iteration and is capable of dealing with high definition (HD) video processing. The proposed method employs a unique true motion engine that explores at most nine motion candidates with different motion directions and then determines one true motion by referring to neighboring spatial information as well as temporal information. Besides, the proposed method introduces an adaptive overlapped block matching algorithm to enhance the searching accuracy and visual quality. An architecture design is also proposed, which employs a modified multi-level successive eliminate algorithm (MSEA) and has capability to reduce the heavy computation of full search.

698096,21220,8494,High speed VLSI architecture design for block turbo decoder,2002,"In this paper, a sub-optimal algorithm for decoding BCH (t /spl ges/ 2) turbo codes is presented. A high speed VLSI decoder architecture is proposed for codes constructed over extended GF(2/sup 5/). While the algorithm applies to higher order BCH product codes, it is shown that this particular block turbo codes, when decoded using the proposed algorithm, gives the best performance (achieving 10/sup -6/ bit error rate at a signal to noise ratio of 2.4 dB) among all two dimensional turbo product codes. Following an analysis of the impact of finite word-length effect on the performance of the SISO decoder, full parallel decoding architecture at the top level and a number of lower level high speed implementation strategies such as applying lookahead technique to reduce the critical path of the merge sort circuit and fast finite field operations are presented.

2463074,21220,9078,Region level segmentation based on a derivative approach for video tracking process,2002,"In this paper a new video tracking process is proposed. Our approach uses two description levels for the segmentation mechanism. The first one, the pixel level, performs the extraction of every point in movement, forming, as result, connected regions. For this stage, a new adaptive reference image (ARI) algorithm is described, based on a derivative approach. This choice presents a robust method facing changes in illumination. The second level, the region level, is driven by the contents of a model set. This high level object description, defined by geometric attributes and a motion model lets us associate the ARI process with the handle objects. This stage sets this up as a Bayesian model formulation. The identification and updating process is done by a modified expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This step establishes the relationship between regions (the ARI process output) and the object models (OM). For each correspondence, the EM procedure is started, updating every attribute of the object description. This framework defines a complete unsupervised tracking procedure, robust regarding occlusions, over- or sub-segmentations and background brightness variations. Several real traffic examples are included at the end of the paper."
308852,21220,8494,"A CMOS PLL-based frequency synthesizer for wireless communication systems at 0.9, 1.8, 1.9 and 2.4 GHz",2001,"In this paper, a phase-locked loop (PLL)-based frequency synthesizer was developed for wireless communication applications at 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz and 2.4 GHz. In order to generate wide-range oscillation signals in the desired frequency bands, a range-programmable voltage-controlled oscillator (RP-VCO) consisting of several controllable inverter rings in parallel was designed. By adjusting the ratios of programmable dividers, and selecting the number of paralleled inverter rings of the RP-VCO, the desired frequency can be generated as demanded by the application system. Instead of using several synthesizers for different frequency bands, only a synthesizer proposed herein can generate these frequency bands in a cost-effective way. By using the TSMC 1P4M 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, the proposed PLL-based frequency synthesizer could yield oscillation signals ranging from 822 MHz to 967 MHz, from 1752 MHz to 1874 MHz, from 1849 MHz to 1933 MHz and from 2356 MHz to 2503 MHz at a supply voltage of 3.3 V. Power dissipation is proportional to the output frequency with 11.6 mW to 35.3 mW. Therefore, the proposed frequency synthesizer could be widely used in various integrated communication systems, providing different oscillation signals in cost-effective and power-efficient manners."
248315,21220,8494,New results on exhaustive search algorithm for motion estimation using adaptive partial distortion search and successive elimination algorithm,2006,"Motion estimation is one of the most computational-intensive tasks in video compression. In order to reduce the amount of computation, various fast motion estimation algorithms have been developed. These fast algorithms can be classified into two groups. One is the lossy motion-estimation approach, which may have some degradation of predicted images, and the other is lossless, which means that the quality of the predicted images is exactly the same as those obtained by the conventional full search algorithm. The partial distortion search and successive elimination algorithm are two well-known techniques belonging to the second kind of approach. These two algorithms use different checking criteria to eliminate as much redundant computations as possible. Actually, the working principles of these methods are independent to each others and it is possible to apply them sequentially in order to achieve greater saving in computation. In this paper, we propose a new fast full-search motion estimation algorithm which can exploit fully the advantages of adaptive partial distortion search and successive elimination algorithm. Experimental results show that this proposed algorithm has an average speed-up of 13.31 as compared with the full search algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. This result is much better than the method simply combing both partial distortion search and successive elimination algorithm, which has an average computational speed-up of 10.60. For a practical realization using a PC, the average execution time speed-up for our algorithm is 4.96, which is also the best performance among all algorithms tested."
2413862,21220,8494,A dual-band RF front-end for WCDMA and GPS applications,2002,"In this work, a dual-band radio frequency (RF) front-end, which can be operated for wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) and Global Positioning System (GPS), is developed. This RF front-end includes two differential low noise amplifiers, double-balanced mixers of I and Q channels and a multiphase voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The front-end architecture without external components is implemented by the low intermediate frequency (IF) technique which is very suitably for circuit integration. As compared to the other RF front-ends receiving multi-frequency bands, the proposed front-end utilizes two low noise amplifiers, shared mixers and multiphase VCO to reduce the hardware complexity. In addition, this architecture is easily scaled to receive more than two frequency bands. Here, a multiphase VCO consisting of a phase-setting unit and range-programmable VCO is utilized to generate two frequency bands having four phases. The frequency band is determined by the number of paralleled inverter rings in the proposed range-programmable VCO. Compared to conventional oscillators, the proposed multiphase VCO can improve phase noise and phase accuracy due to the closed-loop trigger between the phase-setting unit and the range-programmable VCO. By using the TSMC IP6M 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, the proposed dual-band RF front-end was designed at a supply voltage of 1.8 V to have a gain of 30 dB for IF at 2 MHz, IIP3 of -30 dBm and a noise figure of 5 dB."
521065,21220,8494,A novel frequency synthesizer concept for wireless communications,2003,"Strict requirements for high spectral purity, high operating frequencies and fast switching speed together with the power consumption limitations make the frequency synthesizer design an extremely challenging task for wireless applications. In this paper, a combination of analog and digital synthesis techniques is discussed and analyzed. A low frequency tone generated digitally is upconverted to the final frequency range by means of I/Q mixing. Ideally, the use of I/Q processing eliminates the need for any sideband suppression filtering. In practical implementations, however, the amplitudes and phases of the I and Q branches can only be matched with finite relative accuracy, resulting in finite image tone attenuation. Apart from I/Q imbalance, another practical non-ideality is the leakage of the local oscillator signals to the I/Q mixer output ports, creating another undesired tone at the synthesizer output. A compensation structure based on digital predistortion of the low frequency signals is presented to enhance the signal quality. Furthermore, a simple and practical algorithm for updating the compensator coefficients is proposed based on minimizing the envelope variation of the synthesizer output signal. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed frequency synthesizer concept."
2139378,21220,8494,A low-noise monolithic CMOS bio-potential detector,2009,"Bio-potential detection is important for bio-medical diagnostics and research. Bio-potentials are generally weak (µV) with high offsets (100mV level). Low noise processing is critical to extract the signal. In this paper, we report the design of a single-chip CMOS bio-potential detector. The design uses chopping to suppress the low-frequency noise in CMOS amplifiers. The strong offset is removed by a high gain feedback loop with a low pass filter with 1Hz cut-off frequency. A high-gain front stage is designed to further suppress the noise. The nonlinearity in the high-gain front stage can be compensated by calibration. A chopping-pulse free switched-capacitor low-pass filter follows for variable gain amplification and noise bandwidth limiting. The circuit is designed in a 0.35µm CMOS process for 50µV–10mV bio-potentials with offset up to 100mV. HSPICE simulations verify that the designed detector achieve the gain of 400 and 4000. The selectable bandwidth is 1kHz for EEG/ECG/EMG or 5kHz for extra-cellular recording. The design does not require external capacitors. The in-band noise is lower than 58nV/Hz 0.5 .

1605889,21220,8494,Delay-variation-tolerant FIR filter architectures based on the Residue Number System,2013,"This paper investigates the use of the Residue Number System (RNS) in the hardware design of VLSI FIR filters implemented in nano-scale technologies prone to process variation effects. It is here shown that the RNS substantially reduces the filter sensitivity to delay variations, when compared to digital filter designs that use conventional positional number systems, such as the widely-used two's-complement representation. The inherent tolerance of the introduced RNS architectures to the delay variations, is here shown to allow to circumvent the use of large design parameter margins. Therefore, we demonstrate that the use of RNS can achieve a high timing yield without resorting to costly over-design, which may unnecessarily increase system complexity. The particular benefit comes in addition to area, time and power benefits achieved due to the use of the RNS. The quantitative digital filter design space exploration reported in the paper takes into consideration the filter order as well as criteria related to the filter output signal quality such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and it demonstrates that the proposed architectures offer effective solutions for hardware design using modern and future nano-scale processes, for filter cases of practical interest."
2259033,21220,8500,24-channel dual-band wireless neural recorder with activity-dependent power consumption,2013,"Recording neural activity from freely behaving animals has become extremely important for basic research in neuroscience. One of the major limitations in this domain arises from the need of a low-power, lightweight, wireless recording unit that can be used on small animals for at least a couple of hours. To conserve power, it is essential to reduce the large data volume from tens or even hundreds of recording sites. Since it is widely considered that the primary information in neural recording is limited to the infrequent action potentials (AP or spike), the data can be considerably reduced by using a system based on AP activity [1]. This paper presents a complete activity-dependent wireless system that utilizes an ASIC for recording simultaneous AP and local field potential (LFP) signals, improving the state of the art in terms of performance-to-weight ratio. In spite of large data compression, we demonstrate a method to accurately preserve the AP shape, essential for further processing and spike sorting. Finally, this is the first system (see Fig. 16.4.6 comparison table) particularly designed to take advantage of tetrode (four closely placed electrodes) based neural recording units (Fig. 16.4.1)."
1338224,21220,8494,A novel scalable and reconfigurable emulation platform for embedded systems verification,2010,"Modern embedded systems are characterized by a heterogeneous architecture including several modules (e.g., DSPs, memories and mixed-signal IPs) often integrated with one or more microprocessor cores controlling the system functionalities by means of embedded software programs. The verification of such a kind of systems has become a challenge due to their increasing complexity that makes traditional simulation and emulation techniques unaffordable methods for current quality and time-to-market constraints. This paper presents a new platform for the hardware and software verification of modern embedded systems based on a reconfigurable device. The main novelty consists in an infrastructure architecture containing a signal processing IP and a microprocessor core flexibly interfaced with the device under validation, aimed at the overall reduction of the design verification time. It also provides a dynamic interface supporting the software verification of the embedded system microprocessors. The proposed environment is fully scalable and adaptable to the requirements of a general purpose embedded system, enabling advanced verification flows at different phases of design and integration without time expensive interface modification. Experimental and performance analysis on a real industrial case study are reported proving the effectiveness of the proposed solution."
2200762,21220,8494,Hardware acceleration of the robust header compression (RoHC) algorithm,2013,"In LTE base-stations, RoHC is a processing-intensive algorithm that may limit the system from serving a large number of users when it is used to compress the VoIP packets of mobile traffic. In this paper, a hardware-software and a full-hardware solution are proposed to accelerate the RoHC compression algorithm in LTE base-stations and enhance the system throughput and capacity. Results for both solutions are discussed and compared with respect to design metrics like throughput, capacity, power consumption, and hardware resources. This comparison is instrumental in taking architectural level trade-off decisions in-order to meet the present day requirements and also be ready to support a future evolution. In terms of throughput, a gain of 20% (6250 packets/sec) is achieved in the HW-SW implementation by accelerating the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding in hardware. The full-HW implementation leads to a throughput of 45 times (244000 packets/sec) compared to the SW-Only implementation. The full-HW solution consumes more Adaptive Look-Up Tables (7477 ALUTs) compared to the HW-SW solution (2614 ALUTs) when synthesized on Altera's Arria II GX FPGA."
1523751,21220,8494,A high-throughput low-latency arithmetic encoder design for HDTV,2013,"In this paper, we propose a high-throughput low-latency arithmetic encoder (AE) design suitable for high definition (HD) real-time applications employing advanced video coding standards such as H.264/AVC or AVS and using a macroblock (MB) level pipeline. First, in order to derive the performance requirement on the AE, a buffer model in connected with which it is designed is thoroughly analyzed. Then, using joint algorithm-architecture optimization and multi-bin processing techniques, we introduce a novel binary arithmetic coder (BAC) architecture with throughput of 2~4 bins per cycle sufficient for real-time encoding. Furthermore, a hybrid context memory scheme is presented to meet the throughput requirement on the BAC. Simulation result shows that our design can support 1080p at 60 fps for AVS HDTV real-time coding with a bin rate up to 107K per MB line. Synthesized with the TSMC 0.13μm technology, the AE can run at 200MHz and costs 47.3K gates. By operating at 130MHz, the design is also verified in an AVS HD encoder on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA prototype board for 1080p at 30 fps."
1929793,21220,8494,Accurate statistical analysis of a differential low noise amplifier using a combined SPICE-field solver approach,2008,"With continuing trends towards miniaturization of circuits and inclusion of multiple, complex functionalities on a single chip, the effect of process variations on circuit performance is assuming critical importance. In view of increasing frequency of operation, accurate variability analysis of RF/Microwave circuits would require modeling of the variability in the passive elements through a field solver. In this paper, a method for enabling accurate statistical analysis of a low noise amplifier and its differential version is proposed. The on-chip spiral inductors are modeled through an EM (Electromagnetic) solver, while the circuit part is modeled through SPICE. The proposed approach relies on application of the RS (Response Surface) methodology to the y-parameters of both the circuit and the inductors independently and expressing the eventual performance measures through a suitable combination of these y-parameters. The eventual performance measures are expressed through a hierarchical approach in terms of the underlying Gaussian random variables representing both the circuit and EM process parameters. An RSMC (Rapid Response Surface Monte Carlo) analysis on these derived response surfaces furnishes the PDFs and can also be used to predict the yield based on different qualifying criteria and objective functions. Several advantages of this method are outlined."

The wideband amplifier provides 69 dB gain from 30 MHz to 1.2 GHz, realized by a limiting amplifier with an active-inductor load and a cross-coupled g/sub m/ gain-boosting cell in each gain stage. The received signal is digitized at 2 GHz sampling rate by 8 parallel 1-bit ADCs, each of which is composed of transmission-gate type sample-and-hold circuits and a dynamic differential comparator. A timing generator based on a 4-stage ring oscillator in a PLL is employed to provide 8-phase 250 MHz clocks. Realized in 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, the AFE occupies a 1.0/spl times/1.2 mm/sup 2/ active area with the 3/sup rd/ order loop filter integrated in the same die.

2489772,21220,8494,Asynchronous MMC based parallel SA schemes for multiobjective standard cell placement,2006,"Simulated annealing (SA) is a popular iterative heuristic used to solve a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. However, depending on the size of the problem, it may have large run-time requirements. One practical approach to speed up its execution is to parallelize it. In this paper we develop parallel SA schemes based on the asynchronous multiple-Markov chain model (AMMC) described in S.-Y. Lee and K. G. Lee (1996) and applied to standard-cell placement as presented in J. Chandy et al. (1997), The schemes are applied to solve the multi-objective standard cell placement problem using an inexpensive cluster-of-workstations environment. This problem requires the optimization of conflicting objectives (interconnect wire-length, power dissipation, and timing performance), and fuzzy logic is used to integrate the costs of these objectives stated in J.A. Khan et al. (2002) and S. M. Sait and H. Youssef (2001). Experiments are performed on ISCAS-85/89 benchmark circuits. Our goal is to develop parallel SA schemes that provide significantly improved runtime/solution quality characteristics for this key CAD problem, by making the best possible use of an inexpensive parallel environment."

The sensor is based on a CMOS APS array, equipped with in-pixel functionality and integrates analog and digital components to achieve autonomous operation with minimal power dissipation. The system employs a two-phased operation flow; during the initial acquisition stage, the digital controller detects and acquires the brightest targets in the field of view within a single frame and defines windows of interest (WOI) around the center of mass coordinates of each object. Subsequently, the system moves into the analog tracking mode during which all areas outside of the WOI are entirely shut down, thus saving power to a number of orders of magnitude. In addition to its low power dissipation, the sensor features real-time operation, low fixed pattern noise, linearity and the ability to track a predefined number of targets throughout the entire field of view. A 64times64 pixel sensor array has been designed in 0.18 mum CMOS technology and is operated via a 1.8 V supply. The imager architecture is discussed, the circuits' descriptions are shown and simulation results are presented."
1506549,21220,8494,Auditory features based on Gammatone filters for robust speech recognition,2013,"A major challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) relates to significant performance reduction in noisy environments. Recent research has shown that auditory features based on Gammatone filters are promising to improve robustness of ASR systems against noise, though the research is far from extensive and generalizability of the new features is unknown. This paper presents our implementation of the Gamma-tone filter-based feature and the experimental results on Mandarin speech data. By some thorough designs, we obtained significant performance gains with the new feature in various noise conditions when compared with the widely used MFCC and PLP features. A particular novelty of our implementation is that the filter design is purely in the time domain. This means that the channel signals are obtained with a set of Gammatone filters applied directly on the speech signals in time domain, which is totally different from the commonly adopted frequency-domain design that first converts signals to spectra and then applies the filter banks upon them. The time-domain implementation on the one hand avoids the approximation introduced by short-time spectral analysis and hence is more precise; and on the other hand, it avoids the complex spectral computation and hence simplifies hardware realization."

In order to achieve the low-voltage requirement, a novel class-AB switched-current memory cell is adopted to implement the SISDM with the over-sampling ratio (OSR) of 64. In addition, a proposed differential current comparator and a low-voltage 1-bit switched-current digit-to-analog converter (SIDAC) are used for the design of the SDM. Benefits from the SISDM using the class AB memory cell are low-power consumption, high linearity, and high dynamic range. For the various applications with different biosignal frequencies, the SISDM could be operated in different operation mode. The overall SDM with core area of 0.05mm/sup 2/ has been implemented in a TSMC 0.18/spl mu/m 1P6M standard CMOS process technology. Without voltage booster to raise the gate voltage of switches, post-layout simulation results show that the SISDM has a dynamic range over 60dB and a power consumption of 180/spl mu/W with an input signal of 1.25kHz sinusoid wave and 5kHz bandwidth under a single 0.8V power supply for ENG signals."

Two LNA circuits are discussed. One is based on a folded cascode stage and the other one consists on a two-stage inductively degenerated common-source configuration. Both LNAs - designed and implemented in a 1-V 90-nm CMOS technology - employ MOS-varactor based tuning networks to make the operating frequency continuously programmable within the band of interest, targeting the requirements of GSM, UMTS, Bluetooth and WLAN standards, as well as any other operation mode in between. Practical design issues are presented, considering the effect of circuit parasitics associated to both the chip package and integrated inductors, capacitors and varactors; as well as technology parameter deviations. Experimental measurements demonstrate a correct operation of the circuits, showing a continuous tuning of Noise Figure (NF) and S-parameters within a 1.75–2.48GHz band, featuring NF&#60;3.7dB, S 21  >19.6dB and IIP3> −9.8dBm in a frequency range of 1.75–2.23GHz. 1"
2075336,21220,8494,A low-power method adding continuous variable gain to amplifiers,2005,"A method adding continuous gain control to high performance amplifiers is suggested. Any high performance, fixed gain amplifier can adopt the proposed method without deteriorating the performance of the core amplifier. The method is based on the idea of introducing an additional, adjustable feedback path in parallel with a fixed feedback path. The additional, adjustable feedback path can be an active feedback cell compatible with the amplifier architecture used. A low noise transimpedance amplifier would for example require an additional adjustable transconductance cell with proper phase characteristics in parallel with the fixed feedback element used. By making the feedback factor of the adjustable feedback path proportional to the power consumption, extra power is only consumed when gain reduction is necessary. This feature is especially valuable in applications where gain reduction is necessary for a short period of time. One application having this feature is medical ultrasound imaging. The proposed method was originally developed for real-time 3D ultrasound imaging but is compatible with all systems requiring continuous gain control. A prototype circuit was designed were the dynamic range was increased 12dB for an amplifier having 58dB SNR over a bandwidth of 20MHz with a peak penalty of 46% increase in the power consumption from 412/spl mu/W to 663/spl mu/W. The prototype amplifier was design to work at frequencies in the low MHz range."
2636624,21220,8494,Spiking analog VLSI neuron assemblies as constraint satisfaction problem solvers,2016,"Solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is a notoriously expensive computational task. Recently, it has been proposed that efficient stochastic solvers can be obtained through appropriately configured spiking neural networks performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The possibility to run such models on massively parallel, low-power neuromorphic hardware holds great promise; however, previously proposed networks a re based on probabilistically spiking neurons, and thus rely on random number generators or external noise sources to achieve the necessary stochasticity, leading to significant overhead in the implementation. Here we show how stochasticity can be achieved by implementing deterministic models of integrate and fire neurons using subthreshold analog circuits that are affected by thermal noise. We present an efficient implementation of spike-based CSP solvers using a reconfigurable neural network VLSI device, and the device's intrinsic noise as a source of randomness. To illustrate the overall concept, we implement a generic Sudoku solver based on our approach and demonstrate its operation. We establish a link between the neuron parameters and the system dynamics, allowing for a simple temperature control mechanism."
1355557,21220,8494,Perceptual rate distortion optimization for block mode selection in hybrid video coding,2013,"Video compression technologies developed recently have taken advantage of a hybrid approach for better coding efficiency. For example, in the MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding standard and also the new High Efficiency Video Coding, there are numerous possibilities of motion representation and residual coding options in transform domain. The coding parameters, including block modes, motion vectors, and indices of reference frames, are often correlated with each other in spatial and temporal directions. The selection of those coding parameters can affect the coding efficiency greatly. In many of the state-of-the-art solutions, the selection of coding options is based on the minimization of a Lagrangian cost function which is constructed of conventional distortion function and produced data rate. However, the conventional distortion function measured as either sum of absolute difference or mean square error does not often represent the observed deficiency in reconstructed videos. In this paper, a perceptual rate distortion optimization algorithm for block mode selection is developed, and the content-dependent Lagrangian multiplier is then derived. The just-noticeable distortion is used in the proposed method such that perceptual quality can be considered. The simulation results show that the rate-perceptual distortion performance is improved substantially without sacrificing the conventional rate-distortion performance."
408931,21220,8494,On-chip integration of thermoelectric energy harvesting in 3D ICs,2015,"We present a full system integration of a thermoelectric energy harvesting system as an on-chip component into a 3D IC. Our system incorporates a lithographically patterned bi-metallic thin-film thermocouple network with a switched capacitor power converter and a charge buffer capacitor to harvest thermal energy produced by temperature gradients in typical 3D IC structures. Through heat transfer and transistor-level circuit simulations we demonstrate the energy harvesting potential of our system to power a low energy circuit component. Our proposed thin film based harvester does not require package re-design, since it is integrated on-chip using low cost CMOS compatible material. We evaluated integration of our proposed system into a 3D stacking of processor cores and DRAM memory. Even when operating at a conservative thermal bound of 84°C sufficient energy is harvested to continuously sustain a low-power adder for 29,640 cycles of single bit additions or 463 cycles of 64-bit additions with 12usec charging delay. Effectively we can run the adder continuously with less than 0.80% delay between bursts of operations."
2839091,21220,8494,Quality assessment of tone-mapped images based on sparse representation,2016,"Recently, an increasing number of tone-mapping operators (TMOs) have been proposed in order to display high dynamic nge (HDR) images on low dynamic range (LDR) devices. Developing perceptually consistent image quality assessment (QA) measures for TMO is highly desired because traditional LDR based IQA methods cannot support the cross dynamic range quality comparison. In this paper, a novel objective quality assessment method is proposed on the basis of sparse-domain representation, which has been well advocated as a powerful tool in describing natural sparse signals with the over-complete dictionary. Specifically, two indices, incorporating both local and global features extracted from sparsely represented coefficients, are introduced to simulate the human visual system (HVS) characteristics on HDR images. The local feature measures the sparse-domain similarity between the pristine HDR and tone-mapped L R images by leveraging the intrinsic structure with sparse coding. On the other hand, benefiting from the natural scene statistics (NSS), the global features are recovered from the sparse coefficients to account for the natural behaviors of tone-mapped images. Combining the local sparse-domain similarity and the global “naturalness” prior, validations on the public database show that the proposed sparse-domain model for tone-mapped images (SMTI) provides accurate predictions on the human perception of tone-mapped images."
1878465,21220,8494,Realization of QoS management using negotiation algorithms for multiprocessor NoC,2006,"With the growing complexity of new multimedia applications and the parallel execution enabled by multiprocessor architectures, quality-of-service (QoS) management for modern network-on-chip (NoC) systems becomes relevant. This paper presents an approach for efficient usage of platform resources and simultaneously controlling overall system performance, when multiple applications are active. Therefore, on top of the conventional QoS, we introduce an algorithm for setting quality levels of parallel executed applications on a multiprocessor network-on-chip. The new concept is a hierarchical system, where an application manager negotiates with the resource management to jointly optimize the quality of individual and overall application settings. The proposed QoS manager concept was successfully evaluated by an experimental set-up, employing two independent video-object decoders, a background sprite decoder from the MPEG-4 standard and an abstract audio object. This simultaneous execution of four independent applications was mapped on a simulator based on AEthereal network and eight ARM7 processors executed with a clock-cycle true simulator. The proposed distributed QoS management decreases the complexity of the overall management and improves the transparency and responsibilities in the decision taking."
586020,21220,8494,Constant-quality rate allocation for spectral fine granular scalable (SFGS) video coding,2003,"MPEG-4 has proposed FGS (Fine Granular Scalability) video coding technique that can adapt to Internet bandwidth variation. In this paper, we propose the Spectral FGS (SFGS), based on MPEG-4 FGS, and develop rate allocation schemes which are capable of achieving constant video quality. SFGS rearranges enhancement layer bitplane data by grouping them according to frequencies (from DC to high frequency AC components in the zigzag order) before each bit plane data are fed for FGS's 1-D run-length coding. For each bitplane, we compute the rate-distortion (R-D) index of every spectral band and use them to determine the transmission priority, thus improving the transmission efficiency. As for the rate allocation of enhancement layer for SFGS, we accomplish it in two ways : 1) allocating bits between frames in a group of pictures by using frame features 2) allocating bits for all spectral bands in a group of pictures directly by using their R-D indexes. Experiments show that, the former can reduce average quality variation by up to 0.63 dB/frame relative to the traditional uniform method. The latter can however achieve almost constant quality in a group of frames, but need a larger buffer size and result in a longer time delay."

It has the advantages of low dark current and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) over the conventional active-pixel-sensor (APS) imager. It also has a higher frame rate as compared with the pseudo-active-pixel-sensor (PAPS) imager. The shared-zero-buffer structure is proposed to suppress both the photodiode dark current and the leakage current of the pixel switches by keeping both biases of photodiode and parasitic pn junction in the pixel at zero or near zero voltage. The improved double delta sampling (DDS) circuits are also used to suppress fixed pattern noise, clock feedthrough noise, and channel charge injection. An experimental chip of the proposed SBPAPS CMOS imager with a format of 352/spl times/288 (CIF) has been fabricated by using a 0.25 /spl mu/m single-poly-five-level-metal (1P5M) N-well CMOS process. The proposed CMOS imager has a fill factor of 42%, chip size of 3000 /spl mu/m/spl times/2800 /spl mu/m, and dc power dissipation below 30 mW under a power supply of 3.3 V.

In such micro-systems, it is desirable to track individual cells in real time in order to steer cells using on-chip micro-actuators or monitor the movement of motile cells. To address this requirement, we are developing an embedded optical image sensor, called a contact imager, for imaging of a biological specimen directly coupled to the chip surface. The designed CMOS image sensor comprises an array of active pixel sensors (APS), logic and control signal generation, and readout circuits. The pixel layout has a pitch of 8.4 /spl mu/m (24 /spl lambda/). The design was fabricated in a commercially available 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The imager was first characterized on the bench as a normal CMOS image sensor, and then as a contact imager with microbeads (16 /spl mu/m) placed directly on the chip surface. After further packaging with bio-compatible material, the chip was tested with cells cultured directly on the chip surface. Test results confirm successful detection of both beads and cells."
675852,21220,8494,Decomposition and recognition of a multi-channel audio source using matching pursuit algorithm,2004,"Performing real time note detection of multiple audio sources is a difficult task due to the complex nature of audio signals. Typically notes are close in pitch and the harmonic overtones of each note are strongly interlaced, thus preventing standard filtering techniques. In this paper, we develop signal-optimized harmonic atom matching pursuit algorithm, which will be used to decompose an audio signal in terms of elementary waveforms called harmonic atoms. Matching pursuit is an iterative algorithm that correlates the signal against a dictionary set of Gabor atoms and searches for the atoms that exhibit the highest level of correlation. The resulting matched atoms allow for accurate and efficient detection of a single note or multiple notes played simultaneously. In this paper prior knowledge of the signal is used to calculate a parameter set to avoid a costly research over the complete dictionary. The parameter set defined for our proposed algorithm includes time-location, decay rate, frequency, scale and phase, which are calculated at the onset of each note played. The onset (transient) is detected by using a fourth order digital difference then an appropriate interval and optimal window atom is selected. This optimized algorithm is demonstrated through synthesized analysis example. The application of this algorithm in multi-source audio signal can also be demonstrated."

This requirement has posed a challenge to the traditional limit of 125°C for high temperature exposure of electronics systems. The leap in operating temperature to above 200°C in combination with high pressures, vibrations and potentially corrosive environments means that different semiconductors, passives, circuit boards and assembly processes will be needed to fulfill the target performance specifications.

569367,21220,8494,A CMOS circuit for embedded GHz measurement of digital signal rise time degradation,2006,"An embedded diagnosis circuit for quantifying the degradation in digital signals rise/fall time is presented. The proposed measurement technique differs from previous approaches in many ways. Firstly, it avoids the use of undersampling which can become problematic at high speeds; instead, it relies on a real-time asynchronous sampling approach which eliminates the distortion jeopardy imposed by the front-end sampling network, sampling clock jitter, and delay line jitter for GHz range applications. Secondly, the information is processed in the time domain which makes use of the recent developments in time-domain amplification (Oulmane and Roberts, 2004). Thirdly, a dynamic current generation technique is used to achieve great reduction in static power dissipation and allows the front-end level-crossing detector to work at such high speeds.

2396488,21220,8494,Quantitative comparison of commercial CCD and custom-designed CMOS camera for biological applications,2012,"In biological applications and systems where even the smallest details have a meaning, CCD cameras are mostly preferred and they hold most of the market share despite their high costs. In this paper, we propose a custom-designed CMOS camera to compete with the default CCD camera of an inverted microscope for fluorescence imaging. The custom-designed camera includes a commercially available mid-performance CMOS image sensor and a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based hardware platform (FPGA4U). The high cost CCD camera of the microscope is replaced by the custom-designed CMOS camera and the two are quantitatively compared for a specific application where an Estrogen Reception (ER) expression in breast cancer diagnostic samples that emits light at 665nm has been imaged by both cameras. The gray-scale images collected by both cameras show a very similar intensity distribution. In addition, normalized white pixels after thresholding resulted in 4.96% for CCD and 3.38% for CMOS. The results and images after thresholding show that depending on the application even a mid-performance CMOS camera can provide enough image quality when the target is localization of fluorescent stained biological details. Therefore the cost of the cameras can be drastically reduced while benefiting from the inherent advantages of CMOS devices plus adding more features and flexibility to the camera systems with FPGAs."
2499434,21220,8494,Parallel current-steering D/A Converters for Flexibility and Smartness,2007,"This paper presents a DAC architecture built on parallel current-steering sub-DAC entities. Two main novelties are explored: flexibility and smartness. Firstly, a number of available operating modes (op-modes) can set the overall DAC performance and functionality. These op-modes transfer some of the important design trade-offs to the end-user and constitute the DAC flexibility. The main examples include: resolution-power-number of DACs, static-dynamic performance, etc. Secondly, specific signal processing techniques become possible. The main examples of such techniques include: full self-calibration, cancellation of harmonic distortion (HD) components, and linearity improvement through redundancy. This paper concentrates on a method to suppress undesired HD components through DA processing of phase shifted replicas of the main input signal. The presented theoretical concepts are realized in a 14-bit DAC built from 4 parallel 12-bit sub-DACs. Transistor simulations and a layout design are also presented.

Switched-inductor converters play a critical role in this because most portable systems depend on dc-dc converters to supply power efficiently. Understanding the collective impact of shrinking dimensions on total power losses in a switching converter is therefore important when selecting a process technology for the power-supply chip, because the optimal choice results in longer battery life. This paper analyzes and validates the effects of finer CMOS technologies (which feature shorter minimum channel lengths L MIN , higher oxide capacitance, and lower breakdown voltages) on the efficiency performance of switched-inductor dc-dc converters in continuous- and discontinuous-conduction modes (CCM and DCM). Simulation results show that conduction and gate-drive losses in switches rise with L MIN  1.5  and bias and bandwidth-critical quiescent losses with L MIN  and L MIN  3 , respectively. In other words, because parasitic components and gate-drive voltages rise with L MIN , efficiency drops with coarser technologies: E.g., the efficiencies of optimized 0.18-, 0.35-, and 0.5-µm buck converters peaked at 93%, 89%, and 79%."

In this paper, photodiode peripheral utilization effect on the pixel's spectral response was reported. Spectral response of an 18/spl mu/m /spl times/ 18/spl mu/m photodiode CMOS APS pixel was improved by opening multiple circular openings on the photodiode. A CMOS APS imager test chip was designed, fabricated and tested in 0.5/spl mu/m, 5V, 2P3M CMOS process containing 424 /spl times/ 424 pixel arrays with smaller sub arrays for multiple pixel designs. Four pixels with 7, 11, 14, and 17 circular, 1.6/spl mu/m diameter openings were designed and placed on the same imager chip along with one reference pixel with no openings. Spectral response of the pixels were measured and compared. It was found that increased photodiode peripheral improves spectral response of APS pixel by more than 10% in blue spectrum with the expanse of increased dark current."
1250936,21220,8494,TURNUS: A design exploration framework for dataflow system design,2013,"While research on the design of heterogeneous concurrent systems has a long and rich history, a unified design methodology and tool support has not emerged so far, and thus the creation of such systems remains a difficult, time-consuming and error-prone process. The absence of principled support for system evaluation and optimization at high abstraction levels makes the quality of the resulting implementation highly dependent on the experience or prejudices of the designer. This is particularly critical when the combinatorial explosion of design parameters overwhelms available optimization tools. In this work we address these matters by presenting a unified design exploration framework suitable for a wide range of different target platforms. The design is unified and implemented at high level by using a standard dataflow language, while the target platform is described using the IP-XACT standard. This facilitates different design space heuristics that guide the designer during validation and optimization stages without requiring low-level implementations of parts of the application. Our framework currently yields exploration and optimization results in terms of application throughput and buffer size dimensioning, although other co-exploration and optimization heuristics are available."
2899475,21220,8494,Area-efficient partial-clique-energy MRF pair design with ultra-low supply voltage,2016,"As the size of CMOS devices continues to scale down, the reliability of circuits becomes one of main challenges in low supply voltage designs. Markov Random Field (MRF) circuits, a probabilistic-based approach, can achieve higher noise immunity compared to traditional designs under conditions of ultra-low supply voltage and low threshold voltage. However, the basic MRF elements have complex structures and become a stringent factor that limits MRF-based VLSI design. In this paper, we provide a partial-clique-energy MRF (PMRF) design method, trading off the noise immunity for area efficiency. We then propose an Enhanced PMRF (EPMRF)-pair for multi-level and multi-function joint PMRF designs. The main idea is to use the joint clique energy of two complementary partial clique energies to make up performance losses. The measurement results show that, the proposed EPMRF pair can operate at 0.25 V with 10−4 dB output noise power with 5.6 dB input signal-noise ratio (SNR). With the 130 nm CMOS technology, the chip of our EPMRF based carry-look-ahead adder achieves 29% area-saving and 55% energy-saving compared to existing ultra-low supply voltage fault tolerant designs."
2893912,21220,8494,A low power charge mode compressive acquisition of multichannel EEG signals,2016,"The limited power budget of a multiple sensor system such as a wireless body area network (WBAN) necessiates both power efficient sensing architecture and low power circuit implementation. A sparse recovery based sub-Nyquist signal acquisition technique called compressed sensing has been proposed recently, which enables lower power and lesser complexity in the sensing front end. In this work, a low power multichannel EEG signal acquisition system based on distributed compressed sensing has been proposed which performs simultaneous sensing and recovery of multiple sparse signals with compression ratios greater than an individual channel compression. Charge mode switched capacitor circuit techniques are employed to perform the core compressed sensing measurements to reduce power consumption. The system is implemented in a 1.8 V, 0.18 μm CMOS technology with a discrete time sampling based charge domain analog front-end. A single multiplexed 8-bit SAR ADC has been designed and integrated to digitize the measurements from all channels. The system has been tested with a set of EEG signals from practical neural recordings and the results show an average PSNR of 22.17 dB while sensing 64-channels simultaneously at a compression ratio (CR) of up to 1/4."
2880164,21220,8494,Design of a power-efficient widely-programmable Gm-LC band-pass sigma-delta modulator for SDR,2016,"This paper presents the design and implementation of a fourth-order band-pass continuous-time ΣΔ modulator intended for the digitization of radio-frequency signals in software-defined-radio applications. The modulator architecture consists of two Gm-LC resonators with a tunable notch frequency and a 4-bit flash analog-to-digital converter in the forward path and a non-return-to-zero digital-to-analog converter with a finite-impulse-response filter in the feedback path. Both system-level and circuit-level reconfiguration techniques are included in order to allow the modulator to digitize signals placed at different carrier frequencies, from 450MHz to 950MHz. A proper synthesis methodology of the loop-filter coefficients at system level and the use of inverter-based switchable transconductors allow to optimize the performance in terms of robustness to circuit errors, stability and power consumption. The circuit, implemented in 65-nm CMOS, can digitise signals with up to 57-dB SNDR within a 40-MHz bandwidth, with an adaptive power dissipation of 16.7-to-22.8 mW and a programmable 1.2/2GHz clock rate1."
593041,21220,8494,Bio-inspired flight control and visual search with CNN technology,2003,"In this paper it is shown that by building on parallel topographic CNN preprocessing of image flows, efficient terrain exploration and visual navigation algorithms can be developed. The approach combines several channels of nonlinear spatio-temporal feature detectors within an analogic CNN algorithm and produces unique binary maps of salient feature locations. This preprocessing scheme is embedded into a multi-target tracking (MTT) framework where these features are statistically described and assigned to numbered tracks. The MTT output has two distinct roles. First, its feature descriptors drive a classifier based on the adaptive resonance theory (ART), which is also implemented on CNN architecture. Second, it provides an optical flow (target displacement) estimate to the navigation system, which in turn calculates the flight control parameters (Yaw-Pitch-Roll). An upper level visual attention and selection mechanism uses both the feature descriptors and the optical flow estimates to automatically adjust the focus and scale (zoom) during navigation. The paper describes the architecture and the algorithmic frameworks and provides the first experimental results on aerial video-flows."
632096,21220,8494,A new switch compensation technique for inverted R-2R ladder DACs,2005,"Many recent applications are based on DSP and interfaced to I/O with data converters. In this context, high-performance DAC have become crucial building blocks. The current-steering-flash DAC architecture is the most popular architecture for its inherent speed potential. Resolution of these converters is limited by component mismatches, thus gradients and random device variations challenge the analog designers. In high resolution DAC, static specifications are reached thanks to trimming, and dynamic performance is mostly determined by current-steering switch performance. On one hand, mandatory presence of switches impacts static performance, and compensation techniques must be used to cancel switch effects on linearity and gain. On the other hand, dynamic performance is strongly dependent on switch design and operation. In this paper, we present a novel switch compensation technique for inverted R-2R ladder DACs. While traditional switch compensation in the ladder leads to very large switch devices, our method allows current-steering with reduced-equally-sized-switches. This new design method preserves static performance and opens the door to improved dynamic performance. Other improvements include reduced area for both the analog and the digital sides of the converter."
2860278,21220,8494,Dynamic resolution event-based temporal contrast vision sensor,2016,"This paper presents a dynamic resolution asynchronous event-based dynamic vision sensor(DVS) that benifits from low power consumption. Pixel core in this kind of sensor can be divided into two parts: photoreceptor and motion detection circuit. In this design, power is kept low by turning off some pixels' motion detection circuits when there is no event nearby. The full resolution of this sensor is 64 × 64. There are two working states of the sensor: 1.coarse motion detection and 2.fine detection in the region of interest (ROI). In the first state, each 4×4 pixels are grouped into a pixel block. Their photoreceptors are connect together, sharing only one motion detection circuit to monitor motion in the block region. When a block detects event, the other fifteen pixels in the block are powered up and work individually. Higher resolution image of the ROI is sent out via address event representation (AER) protocol. When no more event is detected in this region, the block goes back to state 1. Simulation result shows that the average power can be reduced to 1/9 of the conventional fixed-resolution DVS. This sensor is fabricated using AMS 0.35μm 4M2P CMOS process. Each pixel contains 3 capacitors and 60 transistors, occupying a silicon area of 34×34μm2, with a fill factor of 15.6%."
347368,21220,8494,Super high definition image coding using successive approximation wavelet vector quantization,1995,"A method of coding super high definition (SHD) still images based on vector quantization of wavelet coefficients is proposed. In this coding technique, each block of wavelet coefficients is coded by a series of vectors of decreasing magnitudes, resulting in a successive approximation process. It also exploits the structural similarities among the bands. This provides efficient coding together with the ability to guarantee arbitrary distortion levels for each band, which can be exploited to achieve optimum bit allocation. Since SHD images must have high quality, they must be compressed without any visible picture quality deterioration. Due to the huge amount of image data involved, simplicity of the coding system is important to maintain acceptable processing times. Also, a hierarchical structure is desirable to provide compatibility with other existing lower resolution formats, like in multi-media applications. We demonstrate that the proposed method meets these requirements. Conventional image compression techniques such as transform, subband and vector quantization have already been tested for the coding of SHD images. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves excellent coding performance and it outperforms other SHD image coding methods reported so far by more than 7 dB."
253081,21220,8494,A lattice/transversal joint (LTJ) structure for an acoustic echo canceller,1995,"The least mean square (LMS) algorithm employed in the transversal filter structure has been very popular due to its simplicity. It is, however, often inappropriate to use the LMS algorithm in the transversal filter for designing an acoustic echo canceller since the echo path is usually very long and the algorithm suffers from the slow convergence. Moreover, most echo paths change their characteristics frequently according to the room environment, and thus the algorithm and structure must be chosen carefully in order to allow tracking capability. The adaptive lattice filter is an excellent alternative to improve convergence speed since the lattice structure inherently has the orthogonalization property between the backward prediction errors, but at the expense of the excessive computational load. If the input signal to be used can be modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process (say, P-th order), the reflection coefficients of the lattice filter after stage P will approach asymptotically to zero. In this case, instead of using the full-size lattice structure, the structure may be implemented in conjunction with the transversal filter structure after the P-th stage. In this paper, we propose this new lattice/transversal joint (LTJ) structure, and investigate its performance. We have found that the convergence of this new LTJ structure is almost as fast as that of the full-size lattice filter, while it maintains the computational complexity as low as that of the full-size transversal filter."
483440,21220,8494,Live demonstration: Efficient event-driven approach using synchrony processing for hardware spiking neural networks,2015,"Recent neuromorphic applications now use spiking neural networks (SNNs) because of their improved computational power compared to previous generations of neural networks. Efficient simulation is essential when using this type of neuron since many events have to be handled on a large number of neurons within the network. In this demonstration, a hardware simulator for SNNs that has applications in image recognition is presented. This SNN uses synchrony processing for efficient event-driven simulation (SPEEDS) which allows parallel computations of synchronized events. SPEEDS differs from common event-driven approaches that serialize every event and can improve significantly the computational efficiency of a SNN simulator. The hardware SNN is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and can contain 131 072 neurons. It can process approximately 70 million spikes per second on a 4-bank architecture clocked at 100 MHz. The presentation explains how such a system can be used for image processing tasks like image segmentation, feature extraction and pattern matching to realize a recognition system that can detect several objects in a given image."
614275,21220,8494,Tongue drive: a tongue operated magnetic sensor based wireless assistive technology for people with severe disabilities,2006,"The tongue drive system is a tongue-operated assistive technology developed for people with severe disability to control their environment. The tongue is considered an excellent appendage in severely disabled people for operating an assistive device. Tongue Drive consists of an array of Hall-effect magnetic sensors mounted on a dental retainer on the outer side of the teeth to measure the magnetic field generated by a small permanent magnet secured on the tongue. The sensor signals are transmitted across a wireless link and processed to control the movements of a cursor on a computer screen or to operate a powered wheelchair, a phone, or other equipments. The principal advantage of this technology is the possibility of capturing a large variety of tongue movements by processing a combination of sensor outputs. This would provide the user with a smooth proportional control as opposed to a switch based on/off control that is the basis of most existing technologies. We modeled the effects of position and orientation of the permanent magnet on the sensors in FEMLAB and experimentally measured them. We built a prototype system using off-the-shelf components and tested it successfully by developing a graphical user interface (GUI) in LabVIEW environment. A small battery powered wireless mouthpiece with no external component is under development."
485342,21220,8494,Characterization of ADCs using a non-iterative procedure,1994,"This paper describes procedures to obtain optimum error models for ADCs using a non-iterative technique. The goal of phase-plane compensation for ADCs is to determine the error which is introduced by a converter as a function of the ADC state and the (estimated) slope of the input signal. Past calibration schemes have been frustrated by uncertainties about the input calibration signal. In this paper, the error characteristic is expressed as a linear combination of a set of basis functions, which is then optimised to minimize the harmonic distortion in the output sample sequence. Degradation in performance due to inaccurate estimates of the input signal is avoided. The theories developed in this paper are applied to an 8-bit ADC sampling at 204.8 MSPS. Experimental results show that dynamic range performance can be improved by as much as 12 dB over the Nyquist band. A further interesting result is that an error function measured for one ADC is found to work equally well for another ADC taken from the same production run. The errors determined are thus found to be unique to the ADC design and production, and not to the test and representation methods. It is believed that this is the first time that results of this nature have been reported in the literature. >"
1776064,21220,8494,Low-sensitivity active-RC filters using impedance tapering of symmetrical bridged-T and twin-T networks,2005,"In this paper we introduce a new design procedure for low-sensitivity filter sections, which have a symmetrical passive-RC network in the operational amplifier (opamp) feedback loop. In the design procedure we apply impedance scaling to the symmetrical bridged-T and twin-T networks; they become potentially symmetrical (G.S. Moschytz, Linear integrated networks: fundamentals, V. Nostrand Reinhold, 1974). The design of low-sensitivity all-pole active-RC filters, which have an RC-ladder network in the opamp feedback loop, has already been published (G.S. Moschytz, IEEE Trans. on CAS-11, vol. CAS-46, no. 8, pp. 1009-1026, 1999). There, successive I-sections of the ladder structure are impedance scaled upwards, from the driving source to the positive opamp input; we refer to it as impedance tapering. In both cases we reduce the filter's magnitude sensitivity to variations of the passive components of a circuit. The new design concept is demonstrated by designing two very popular and often used filter sections: a band-pass realized by the Deliyannis SAB, and a band-rejection filter with a twin-T. The sensitivity analysis is examined analytically and double-checked using PSpice Monte Carlo runs."
1931811,21220,8494,ECC Processor with Low Die Size for RFID Applications,2007,"This paper presents the design of a special purpose processor with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) functionality. This digital signature generation device (SGD) was developed especially for RFID tags. The design parameters were low energy consumption, small chip area, robustness against cryptographic attacks, and flexibility. The SGD was designed to work as digital processor in an RFID tag requiring the tag to provide the secret key storage and a PRNG. The SHA-1 calculation needs to be included into the SGD to avoid a microcontroller on the tag. The asymmetric cryptosystem allows authentication of the tag to untrusted third parties without revealing the secret key. The ECDSA functionality was implemented using a prime field GF(p) and affine coordinates, an alternative way to reduce the die size and the costs of the tag. The standard-cell based implementation of the device is fully scalable for different prime fields sizes. The GF(p 192 ) version will need 23k gate equivalents or 1.3 mm 2  for a 0.35 mum process. 502k clock cycles are used for signature generation. The near-Spice level power simulation with Nanosim estimated the final energy consumption to 0.846 mWs for a generated signature."
1809425,21220,8494,A Practical CMOS Companding Sinh Lossy Integrator,2007,"This paper outlines the design and simulated performance of a novel, current-mode, companding, Class-AB, Sinh lossy integrator. Prior Sinh filter designs utilize current conveyor-like blocks which incorporate both N- and P-type devices in alternate cascode arrangement to process the split-ted phases of the input. However, if these blocks were to be designed in weak inversion CMOS, the bulks of all the devices involved should be connected to their respective sources for accurate exponential/logarithmic conformity, which dictates the use of a triple-well process. Triple-well processes, apart from the fact that are not always available, have increased parasitics compared to twin-well ones, making the design and optimization of these already complicated filters a rather difficult one. In this paper, we present a new Sinh lossy integrator circuit that uses (either N- or) P-type devices rendering it to be practically realizable in any standard twin-well process. The circuit has been designed in 0.35mum AMS CMOS process with all simulation results obtained from Cadence Design Frameworkreg. The resulting lossy integrator exhibits a simulated input dynamic range greater than 120dB with only one integrating capacitor, while dissipating 0.3muW of power."
1936474,21220,8494,Enhanced efficient Diamond Search algorithm for fast block motion estimation,2009,"In this paper, a Modified Diamond Search (MDS) algorithm is proposed for fast motion estimation based on the well known Diamond Search (DS) algorithm. A set of computationally efficient algorithms that can be applied to any block matching algorithm and is applied to the DS as a study case achieves higher complexity reduction than DS algorithm without further relative PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) degradation compared to Full Search (FS). First, Dynamic Internal Stop Search (DISS) algorithm is used to reduce the internal redundant SAD (Sum of Absolute Difference) operations between the current and the candidate blocks using an accurate dynamic threshold. Second, a Dynamic External Stop Search (DESS) greatly reduces the unnecessary operations by skipping all the irrelevant blocks in the search area. In addition, early search termination and adaptive pattern selections techniques are applied to the proposed MDS as initialization steps to achieve even higher complexity reduction. The accuracy of the proposed model threshold equations guarantee not to fall into a local minima. Experiments show that the proposed MDS algorithm reduces the computations greatly up to 99% and 20% compared with the conventional FS algorithm and DS respectively with no significant degradation in both the PSNR and the bit-rate."
2319292,21220,8494,Multiobjective VLSI cell placement using distributed simulated evolution algorithm,2005,"Simulated evolution (SimE) is a sound stochastic approximation algorithm based on the principles of adaptation. If properly engineered it is possible for SimE to reach near-optimal solutions in less time than simulated annealing. Nevertheless, depending on the size of the problem, it may have large run-time requirements. One practical approach to speed up the execution of the SimE algorithm is to parallelize it. This is all the more true for multi-objective cell placement, where the need to optimize conflicting objectives (interconnect wirelength, power dissipation, and timing performance) adds another level of difficulty. In this paper a distributed parallel SimE algorithm is presented for multiobjective VLSI standard cell placement. Fuzzy logic is used to integrate the costs of these objectives. The algorithm presented is based on random distribution of rows to individual processors in order to partition the problem and distribute computationally intensive tasks, while also efficiently traversing the complex search space. A series of experiments are performed on ISCAS-85/89 benchmarks to compare speedup with serial implementation and other earlier proposals. Discussion on comparison with parallel implementations of other iterative heuristics is included."
535576,21220,8494,Functional verification of ECL circuits including voltage regulators,1993,"Three major steps in designing emitter-coupled logic (ECL) circuits are generating correct functional behavior, guaranteeing design rules are obeyed, and verifying delay behavior. Previous ECL simulators have not addressed the checking of design rules, and have not included voltage regulators. In the authors' functional verifier, the circuit partitioning module divides the circuit into current source trees and identifies voltage regulators. The reference voltages generated by the voltage regulators are calculated using electrical simulation techniques, and a simplified Ebers-Moll transistor model is used to calculate current sharing in emitter-coupled transistors of the switching subcircuits. The functional verification approach introduced can be used to verify circuit functionality under varying operating conditions of power supply voltage, temperature and device parameters, and, in addition, to detect design errors such as deep transistor saturation, excessive emitter current and voltage margin violations. For an industrial benchmark circuit with 842 transistors, the authors' functional verifier performs the functional simulation and detects design errors over 800 times faster than the DC and transient analysis of simulation program with IC emphasis (SPICE)3. >"

In this paper, we modified the reference software in a hardware-friendly way. Our main idea is to convert the sequential processing of each 8/spl times/8 sub-partition of a macro-block into parallel processing without sacrifice of video quality. Based on our algorithm, we proposed a new hardware architecture for variable block size motion estimation with full search at integer-pixel accuracy. The features of our design are 2-D processing element array with 1-D data broadcasting and 1-D partial result reuse, parallel adder tree, memory interleaving scheme, and high utilization.

The algorithm is enhanced to detect large number of different P-QRS-T waveform morphologies using adaptive search windows and adaptive threshold levels. The proposed architecture has been implemented in the state-of-the-art 65-nm CMOS technology. It occupied 0.03416 mm2 area and consumed 0.614 mW power. Furthermore, the non-complex nature of the architecture resulted with a realization using smaller number of computation and higher performance. The design of the QRS detector was tested on ECG records obtained from the Physionet QT database and achieved a sensitivity of Se =99.83% and a positive predictivity of P + = 98.65%. Similarly, the mean error values of the T peak, T offset, P peak and P offset were found to be −1.367, 6.36, 5.5 and −2.59 milliseconds, respectively, using the same database.

2374202,21220,8494,Missing feature speech recognition in a meeting situation with maximum SNR beamforming,2008,"Especially for tasks like automatic meeting transcription, it would be useful to automatically recognize speech also while multiple speakers are talking simultaneously. For this purpose, speech separation can be performed, for example by using maximum SNR beamforming. However, even when good interferer suppression is attained, the interfering speech will still be recognizable during those intervals, where the target speaker is silent. In order to avoid the consequential insertion errors, a new soft masking scheme is proposed, which works in the time domain by inducing a large damping on those temporal periods, where the observed direction of arrival does not correspond to that of the target speaker. Even though the masking scheme is aggressive, by means of missing feature recognition the recognition accuracy can be improved significantly, with relative error reductions in the order of 60% compared to maximum SNR beamforming alone, and it is successful also for three simultaneously active speakers. Results are reported based on the SOLON speech recognizer, NTT's large vocabulary system [1], which is applied here for the recognition of artificially mixed data using real-room impulse responses and the entire clean test set of the Aurora 2 database."
450877,21220,8494,An inertial sensor based balance and gait analysis system,2015,"Time-up and Go Test (TUGT) is a common clinical motility test for the elderly. Currently it is measured manually, which is human resource consuming, less accurate, and limited in capability of measuring sophisticated parameters. In this paper, we propose a system consisting of three inertial-sensor-based measuring components, a remote controller, and an analysis software for automatic balance and gait analysis in TUGT. This system is designed to be of easy use with the software automatically measuring the time intervals of stand-up time, sit-down time, and the total time of test. In addition, the system can also obtain the gait information of stride time, swing time, and stance time. To validate the system, we compared the performance with that obtained from stopwatch using videos as the gold standard. The results indicate that the system not only provides a convenient way of measurement but also achieves higher accurate and reliable measurement results than using stopwatch. We use this system to compare the Alzheimer's disease patients (ADs) with health controllers (HCs). The results show that the ADs need longer stand-up time, sit-down time, and total time while taking the TUGT compared to the HCs. The stride time, swing time, and stance time are also longer than the HCs'. Such a friendly system provides high potential in tracking long-time patterns for diagnosis."
2389577,21220,8494,Local interpolation filter estimation for fractional-pel displacement vector in video coding,2009,"ISO/IEC Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) have collaborated for development of new international video coding standard with high coding efficiency and network friendly video representation features. In 2003, JVT (collaboration group of MPEG and VCEG) published international standard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC which is the state of the art video coding technology. Several major technical progresses including precise fractional-pel displacement vector resolution with pre-fixed interpolation filter let H.264/MPEG-4 AVC have superior video coding efficiency compared to the previous standards such as MPEG-4, H.263 and etc. For recent years, many researches on interpolation filter for fractional-pel displacement vector have shown possibility for further improvements of video coding efficiency. Most investigations are on improvement of pre-fixed interpolation filters by transmitting texture dependent interpolation filter coefficients to decoder side. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for improvement of pre-fixed interpolation filter without transmitting filter information to decoder side, named as local interpolation filter estimation (LIFE). For generation of prediction signal with fractional-pel displacement vector, a local interpolation filter is estimated by exploitation of previously decoded spatial neighboring texture. Experimental results showed that we could get about 2 13% bit saving with LIFE compared to H.264 High Profile low delay condition."
373246,21220,8494,Automatic design of high-order SC filter circuits,2015,"The manual design of Switched-Capacitor (SC) filters can be a strenuous process. This task becomes even more complex when the high gain amplifier is replaced by a low gain amplifier due to the loss of the virtual ground node, increasing the complexity of the filter's transfer function and requiring the compensation of the parasitic capacitances during the design phase. This paper proposes an automatic procedure for the design of high order SC filters using low gain amplifiers. The design methodology is based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using hybrid cost functions with varying goal specifications. The cost function first uses equations for the estimation of the filter's transfer function and, once the specifications are met, the filter is further optimized in order to increase its robustness to random variations. Afterwards, the gain and settling time of the amplifier is also estimated using equations and optimized against several process corners. The use of equation-based cost functions reduces the computation time, allowing the use of larger populations to cover the entire design space. Once all specifications are met, the GA uses transient electrical simulations of the circuit in the cost functions, resulting in the accurate determination of the filter's transfer function, and obtaining the final design solution within a reasonable amount of computation time."
1923199,21220,8494,A Simplified Structure for FIR Filters with an Adjustable Fractional Delay,2007,"This paper introduces an efficient filter structure for implementing finite-impulse response (FIR) filters with an adjustable fractional delay. In this structure the first two subfilters are the same as in the modified Farrow structure, whereas the remaining ones are generated by properly combining these two subfilters with some additional very short filters, pure delay terms, adders, and multipliers. For significantly reducing the number of multipliers, the three-step synthesis scheme proposed by Yli-Kaakinen and Saramaki in the case of the modified Farrow structure is followed. First, the number of subfilters and their orders are determined such that the given criteria are sufficiently exceeded. Second, an initial filter is determined using a simple design scheme. This filter serves as a start-up solution for further optimization being performed using a constrained nonlinear optimization algorithm. Third, those coefficient values of the subfilters having a negligible effect on the overall system performance are fixed to be zero-valued. Both the performance and complexity of the proposed adjustable digital filters are compared with those of some existing adjustable FIR filters proposed in the literature. This comparison shows that, in the case of stringent amplitude and phase delay specifications, the number of multipliers for the proposed filters is less than 80 percent when compared with the corresponding optimized modified Farrow structure."
2005562,21220,8494,Algebraic integer based 8×8 2-D DCT architecture for digital video processing,2011,"A time-multiplexed row-parallel architecture is proposed for the real-time implementation of bivariate algebraic integer (AI) encoded 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) of images and video sequences. The architecture is based on the Arai algorithm with AI encoding. This leads to an 8×8 2-D DCT which is entirely free of quantization errors. The error free coefficients may be converted into a regular arithmetic format using a final reconstruction step (FRS) at the output stage. The accuracy of the FRS allows each of the 64 coefficients to have its precision set independent of other coefficients without the leakage of quantization noise between coefficient channels. Our architecture leads to low-noise applications in digital video compression, coding, and other image processing applications that rely on the fast systolic computation of the 2-D DCT. A prototype of the 2-D DCT is physically realized, tested, and verified on chip, using a Xilinx Virtex-4 Sx35-10ff668 device. The maximum clock rate was F clock  = 121 MHz, implying an equivalent frame sample rate of 466 Hz, for an image frame size of 1920×1080, which is a common high definition video format."
1849689,21220,8494,VLSI implementation of an 855 Mbps high performance soft-output K-Best MIMO detector,2012,"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique can significantly increase data throughput without sacrificing additional bandwidth. However, data detection at the receiver and its VLSI implementation is challenge due to high computation complexity. This paper presents the VLSI architecture and implementation for a 4×4 64-QAM soft-output K-Best MIMO detector. A novel deeply pipelined architecture which makes use of all the full-length ZF-augmented discarded paths (DPs) is designed to reduce complexity and improve BER performance. Furthermore, to save area and latency, two improvement methods—abandoning DPs of bottom levels and performing ZF-augmentation at the last stage are proposed. The presented detector improves the BER performance by 2.3dB at BER=10 −3  compared to the conventional soft K-Best scheme when using the minimum mean squared error-sorted QR decomposition (MMSE-SQRD). It can achieve a peak throughput of 855 Mbps while consuming 223K gates, 301pJ/bit and 102 cycles for latency in SMIC 0.13µm CMOS process."
2088261,21220,8494,Analysis and Performance Evaluation of a Digital Carrier Synchronizer for Modem Applications,2007,"Digital communication systems such as modulation-demodulation and M-PSK require the use of carrier synchronization in phase and frequency. This work addresses the implementation and analysis of a digital carrier synchronizer (DCS), which is a phase-locked loop (PLL), realized using digital circuits. This novel methodology highlights implementation promises towards some of the critical issues associated with the design of its analog counterpart, usually known as PLL. The principle function of this DCS is heavily dependent on the numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) and the loop filter (LF). There are various methods to implement NCOs and LFs that are used in the architectural model of DCS. This paper examines the performance of two different NCOs and LFs realization in DCS for modem (modulator-demodulator) application. The methods presented are look up table (LUT) and Xilinx ROM based NCO in one hand, and 1st order and 2nd order based LF. Each has its own merits and de-merits. The paper also developed a mathematical model of DCS for stability analysis. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the performance of this two implementations based on three performance metrics i.e. stability, locking-time and tracking range. From the analysis, Xilinx ROM based NCO with 2nd order LF performs better and are more suited for modem's DCS."
693615,21220,8494,An efficient SNR scalability coding framework hybrid open-close loop FGS coding,2006,"This paper presents a novel high-efficient hybrid open-close loop based fine granularity scalable (HOCFGS) coding framework supporting different decoding complexity applications. The open-loop motion compensation for inter-pictures is introduced to efficiently exploit the temporal correlation among adjacent pictures for both base layer and FGS enhancement layer within a wide bit-rate range. An efficient rate-distortion optimized macro-block mode decision rule is used to reduce drifting error and achieve comparable coding performance at the lowest bit-rate point (base layer) with non-scalable coding. An approach like MPEG-4 FGS coding with close-loop motion compensation only at base layer is used for some inter-pictures to stop the drifting error propagation. Furthermore, to achieve better coding performance for these inter-pictures, block based progressive fine granularity scalable (BLPFGS) is introduced, in which leaky prediction is used to generate high-quality reference for FGS enhancement layer. In BLPFGS coding, efficient bit-plane coding and de-blocking techniques are investigated to improve the coding performance for FGS enhancement layer, especially at low bit-rate points. The coding performance for the proposed method is verified by integrating it into MPEG SVC reference software."
581337,21220,8494,A foveated AER imager chip [address event representation],2005,"We have developed a foveated imager chip with high resolution photo-cells (referred to as static pixels) in the center that are surrounded by more space consuming adaptive change detection pixels (referred to as dynamic pixels). Inspired by the neurons of biological nervous systems, they emit short voltage pulses, the static pixels with a frequency proportional to light intensity, the dynamic pixels whenever they detect a relative change in irradiance. The pulses are transmitted off-chip by the address event representation (AER) protocol, i.e. via a digital bus as the identifying address of the sending pixel. For the motion pixels, this read-out strategy has the advantage of low latency in the order of 100 ns after a change is encountered. (Whereas a scanning read-out strategy would on average suffer a delay of half of the frame scanning period.) Mounted on a pan-tilt system, the peripheral motion detectors could, for instance, be used to steer the imager such that the image of a moving object falls onto the central pixel array where it can then be examined in detail at a higher resolution. Or, if the imager is mounted statically, they can detect an intruder and cause the central pixels to be turned on for more detailed observation"

Therefore a high performance VLSI architecture of FME is described in this paper to achieve the capacity of encoding the high-resolution real-time video stream for HDTV. Our design is improved from an existing work by involving a pipeline strategy in sub-pixel interpolation unit which can avoid the long delay paths in 6-tap ID FIR so as to increase the clock frequency up to 200MHz. Moreover, a 16-pixel search engine is adopted to remove the redundant interpolation area and parallelize the various block size search which can save more than half of the clock cycles in processing a macro block. Our design is implemented with only 189K gates at operating frequency of 200MHz in worst case (285MHz in typical case). It can provide the processing capacity of more than 250K MB/sec which is enough for 1080HD (1920/spl times/1088) video streams at frame rate of 30fps. It is a useful intellectual property (IP) design for multimedia system."
2200126,21220,8494,A new synthesis methodology for reliable RF front-end Design,2011,"A low power and low cost WLAN/WiMAX RF front-end requires more advanced CMOS technologies whose transistor parameters degradation is becoming worse. Few published works has presented the reliability results for RF circuits. In order to fill this gap, we develop a new synthesis methodology for reliable RF front-end design using the design example of a reliable BLIXER. The first steps of our synthesis methodology is a transistor ageing simulation. Then, we calculate an estimation of the circuit performance and ageing using the circuit design equations and the total derivatives. Thus, we can find the required bias and sizing improving the circuit reliability. The simulation results of the typical circuit are coherent with the WLAN/WiMAX RF front-end specifications. Despite the integrated process variability and mismatch, we observe that 96.4 % of the simulation runs have Gain > 10.0 dB, and 92.1% of the simulation runs have NF max &#60; 5.0 dB. Moreover, the BLIXER ageing degradation is negligible according to the fitted Poisson distribution of the power consumption for 99.9% of confidence. Going further, we can say that the synthesis methodology proposed and developed for a RF front-end design can be exploited in different AMS/RF circuits and also generalized for a single bottom-up reliable-system design approach."
671143,21220,9078,Spatio-temporal model-assisted compatible coding for low and very low bitrate videotelephony,1996,"We introduce the concept of spatio-temporal model-assisted compatible (STMAC) coding, a technique to selectively encode areas of different importance to the human eye in terms of space and time in moving images. For this, we use the fact that human eye contact and lip synchronization are very important in person-to-person communication. Several areas including the eyes and lips need different types of quality, since different areas have different perceptual significance to human observers. For example, for the eyes high resolution is needed for clear communication, while for the lips frequent refresh is needed. The approach provides a better rate-distortion tradeoff than conventional image coding technologies based on MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, as well as H.263, since STMAC coding is applied on top of an encoder, taking full advantage of its core design. The decoder does not need to be changed in any way although the encoder's rate control unit is slightly modified. This characteristic leads to the name compatible in the proposed concept. Experimental results are given using ITU-T H.263, addressing very low bit rate compression (13-17 Kbps)."
2521893,21220,8494,Glitch-aware output switching activity from word-level statistics,2008,"This paper presents models for estimating the transition activity of signals at the output of adders in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), given only word-level measures of the correlation and variance of the input signals to these components. This will allow the power consumed in the output wires of these components to be estimated from a high-level description before RTL-synthesis, without resorting to time-consuming low-level simulation. The proposed model combines knowledge of the internal construction of adders on FPGAs with the Transition Density model for activity propagation [1] and typical activity profiles for signals within Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems according to the DBT model [2], and is characterized using device-level power measurements. The resulting closed form expression allows power consumption estimates to be quickly made in order to drive design exploration decisions during power-aware synthesis. The model has been verified by comparing it to power estimates generated by the low-level power estimation tool XPower, achieving a mean relative error in total activity of 2.1%, whilst being several orders of magnitude times faster than XPower."
2013059,21220,8494,Architecture design of H.264/AVC decoder with hybrid task pipelining for high definition videos,2005,"The most critical issue of an H.264/AVC decoder is the system architecture design with balanced pipelining schedules and proper degrees of parallelism. In this paper, a hybrid task pipelining scheme is first presented to greatly reduce the internal memory size and bandwidth. Block-level, macroblock-level, and macroblock/frame-level pipelining schedules are arranged for CAVLD/IQ/IT/INTRA/spl I.bar/PRED, INTER/spl I.bar/PRED, and DEBLOCK, respectively. Appropriate degrees of parallelism for each pipeline task are also proposed. Moreover, efficient modules are contributed. The CAVLD unit smoothly decodes the bitstream into symbols without bubble cycles. The INTER/spl I.bar/PRED unit highly exploits the data reuse between interpolation windows of neighboring blocks to save 60% of external memory bandwidth. The DEBLOCK unit doubles the processing capability of our previous work with only 35.3% of logic gate count overhead. The proposed baseline profile decoder architecture can support up to 2048/spl times/1024 30 fps videos with 217 K logic gates, 10 KB SRAMs, and 528.9 MB/s bus bandwidth when operating at 120 MHz."

To decrease power consumption, a passive sample-and-hold (SH) circuit and an opamp-free, capacitor-based digital-to-analog converter (DAC) are utilized. The only active circuit, a comparator, is implemented in the sub-threshold region to preserve the required bias current.

1753642,21220,8494,A wirelessly-powered UWB sensor tag with time-domain sensor interface,2014,"This paper presents a wirelessly-powered sensor tag with a time-domain sensor interface for wireless sensing applications. The tag is remotely powered by RF wave. Instead of traditional approaches employing conventional ADCs for quantization and transmitter for data communication, in this work, a Pulse Position Modulator incorporating simple impulse radio UWB (IR-UWB) transmitter is proposed to convert and transmit the analog sensing information in time domain. The analog signal is compared with an adjustable triangular wave for analog to time conversion in signal-varying environments. Then a UWB transmitter converts the PPM signal to very short pulses and sends it back to the reader. The time interval of UWB pulses represents the original input signal in time domain which can be measured on the reader side by a time-to-digital conversion. This approach not only simplifies the ADC design but also relaxes the number of bits transmitted on the tag side. The sensor tag is designed in 180nm CMOS process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduce transmission power consumption by nearly 3 orders of magnitude over traditional approaches, while consuming only 85 μW for 1.5 MS/s sampling rate."

The capacitive sensors are realized by a fully differential capacitance to voltage converter, a differential ΣΔ modulator, and interdigitated electrodes built on top-most metal layer (M4) in 0.35 μm CMOS process. The pH sensor is composed of an array of 8×8 inverters employing a pair of p-type and n-type ISFETs sharing the same ion sensitive membrane. The complementary pair of ISFETs works as a chemical switch that can be used for pH thresholding and is functional in the wide pH range of 1 to 14 with the sensitivity of 50 mV/pH.

The application of a new mathematical model, in a shifted double-well system exhibiting stochastic resonance, is investigated for such images. The new mathematical model addresses the shortcomings of earlier SR-based enhancement model by deriving parameters purely from input values (instead of input statistics). This model is specific to spatial domain pixel representation and operates on a revised iterative equation. This iterative processing is here applied selectively to the under-illuminated regions of the image, characterized as the De Vries-Rose (DVR) region of a human psychovisual model. The idea of suitably modifying the existing universal image quality index is also proposed for its participation in iteration termination, and to gauge the property of dynamic range compression. While the iterative algorithm is terminated using the revised image quality index, entropy maximization, and contrast quality of DVR region with constraints on perceptual quality, the performance of the proposed algorithm is also characterized by observing color enhancement and subjective scores on visual quality."

A data-driven background algorithm was used as adaptive multiple thresholding algorithm to categorize the cells into three classes: bright cells, dark cells, and background. Our image analysis approach includes: (1) the scale-space theory, namely Gaussian filtering with proper scale has been applied to the acquired images to generate local intensity maxima within each cell; (2) a novel method for defining local image intensity maxima based on the gradient vector field has been developed; and (3) a statistical model was proposed to overcome the problem of cell segmentation. Our data have shown that the automated image analysis protocol can achieve 90% success rate of cell detection compared to manual procedure. Cellular image analysis further indicated that H4 neuroglioma cells had a dose-dependent toxic response to the insult of CuO nanoparticles."
1299130,21220,8494,Low power sub-threshold asynchronous QDI Static Logic Transistor-level Implementation (SLTI) 32-bit ALU,2013,"We propose an asynchronous-logic (async) Quasi-Delay-Insensitive (QDI) Static Logic Transistor-level Implementation (SLTI) approach for low power sub-threshold operation. The approach is implemented to design 32-bit pipelined Arithmetic and Logic Units (ALUs), the primary computation core for microprocessors, and benchmarked against the reported Pre-Charged Half-Buffer (PCHB). There are two key attributes in this proposed design. First, the proposed SLTI ALU design can perform dynamic voltage scaling seamless by only changing the supply voltage from nominal (1V) to sub-threshold (~0.2V) regions for high speed/low power operation. Second, the ALU achieves ultra-low power dissipation (3.5μW) at the lowest V DD  point (~0.15V). For fair of comparison, both implemented ALUs have identical functionality and functional blocks, are implemented using the same 65nm CMOS process. Based on the simulations, the minimum energy point occurs at V DD  = 0.2V for SLTI-based ALU and at V DD  = 0.3V for PCHB-based ALU. The SLTI-based ALU have ~93% and ~89% lower energy on the arithmetic and logic operations respectively from V DD  = 1V to V DD  = 0.2V. At V DD  = 0.2V, with 9MHz input switching rate, the async ALU based on our proposed SLTI approach dissipates ~51% and ~44% lower power than the reported PCHB counterpart on the arithmetic and logic operations respectively."
359052,21220,8494,Analysis of parallel processor architectures for the solution of the Black-Scholes PDE,2015,"Common parallel computer microarchitectures offer a wide variety of solutions to implement numerical algorithms. The efficiency of different algorithms applied to the same problem vary with the underlying architecture which can be a multi-core CPU, many-core GPU, Intel's MIC (Many Integrated Core) or FPGA architecture. Significant differences between these architectures exist in the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and the way the compute flow is executed. The way parallelism is expressed changes with the ISA, thread management and customization available on the device. These differences pose restrictions to the implementable algorithms. The aim of the work is to analyze the efficiency of the algorithms through the architectural differences. The problem at hand is the one-factor Black-Scholes option pricing equation which is a parabolic PDE solved with explicit and implicit time-marching algorithms. In the implicit solution a scalar tridiagonal system of equations needs to be solved.

In this paper, we present the design of a low-power analog front-end (AFE) with configurable characteristics that tracks the tongue motion by reading four intraoral 3-D magnetic sensors to indicate the position of a small magnet attached to the tongue. Duty cycling is employed as a key feature in this system to reduce power consumption in the sensors and in the low-noise interfacing circuits, allowing for energy savings as much as 92%, which greatly extends the battery life. The AFE has been implemented in a 0.5-µm CMOS process and consumes 7.1 µA per sensor readout from a 1.8/4.2 V supply at a minimum duty cycle of 2%. Post-layout simulations show that the readout channels typically feature a noise density of 57 nV/vHz and a CMRR above 120 dB within the frequency band of interest (DC-2.5 kHz).

292783,21220,8494,A new nonlinear algorithm for the removal of impulse noise from highly corrupted images,1994,"Images are often corrupted by impulse noise from a noisy sensor or channel transmission errors. The goal of impulse noise removal is to suppress the noise while preserving the edges and the details. To this end, nonlinear techniques have been found to provide more satisfactory results in comparison to linear methods. The two often used nonlinear methods are the median filter and the outlier method. In median filtering the central pixel inside a window is replaced by the median value of all pixels in the window. However, median filtering not only removes impulse noise but also introduces distortion, in particular, for highly corrupted images. The outlier method is based on a detection-estimation strategy in which the impulse noise is detected first and then an average of all pixel values inside a window centered at the defected corrupted pixel is used as an estimate of its true value. This approach is also not effective for highly corrupted images. Recently, we proposed an efficient method to remove impulse noise from a highly corrupted image also based on a detection-estimation strategy, in which the impulse noise is detected first using a simple quadratic filter, and a selectively chosen local mean is used to estimate the true value of the corrupted pixel. A major limitation of this approach is that often it has to be applied twice to arrive at a satisfactory result. This second run not only increases computational cost but also reduce the quality of the processed image. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of this newly proposed method of impulse noise removal, and then advance a modified version which does not require a second run. >"

Our comparative study measures the energy consumption effects of important video-coding parameters, like Search Range (SR), Quantization Parameter (QP), and video resolution on both encoders. The obtained results for HEVC showed, for the Random Access (RA) prediction structure, gains of 25% in BD-Rate over H.264/AVC at the expense of 17% higher energy consumption. A new metric we defined herein, called BD-Energy, was used in the SR analysis, and the results from this investigation showed HEVC achieved an energy consumption up to 37.6% higher for a BD-Rate gain of 32.2%. The QP analysis demonstrated that the energy consumption gap between both encoders varies greatly as QP increases, resulting in a 15.08% difference from QP 22 to QP 37, on average. The major finding from our work is that the HEVC encoder presents better results in the energy/compression trade-off, but this efficiency is reduced as encoding becomes more complex, as our results discovered that the HEVC energy consumption scales faster."
755220,21220,8494,A new VLSI IC design automation methodology with reduced NRE costs and time-to-market using the NPN class Representation and functional symmetry,2014,"In the VLSI IC design, the number of incremental and iterative steps in the design automation methodology will decide the non-recurring-engineering (NRE) costs and time-to-market (TTM). Since these are the major driving factors of the IC design, many algorithms were proposed in the last few decades to minimize/optimize the number of design steps in the conventional VLSI IC Design methodology. However the frontend and backend designs have to be carried separately, which has limited the further minimization of the number of design steps. Here we propose a new unconventional design automation methodology, which reduces the NRE costs and TTM by merging the frontend and backend designs partially. It maps the input RTL description directly to their corresponding physical designs (derived using the existing CAD tools and stored in a pre-computed library) without any limitation on the Boolean function's input size. We have exploited the functional symmetry and negationpermutation- negation (NPN) class representations to decoct the library size and number of comparisons. The functional symmetry reduced the number of required pre-computed circuits in our experiments from 1031 to 222 (464.4% reduction in the memory size) and helps in maintaining the regularity in the design, which is a major concern for engineering change order"
1005862,21220,22130,Simultaneous mosaicing and tracking with an event camera,2014,"© 2014. The copyright of this document resides with its authors.An event camera is a silicon retina which outputs not a sequence of video frames like a standard camera, but a stream of asynchronous spikes, each with pixel location, sign and precise timing, indicating when individual pixels record a threshold log intensity change. By encoding only image change, it offers the potential to transmit the information in a standard video but at vastly reduced bitrate, and with huge added advantages of very high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event data calls for new algorithms, and in particular we believe that algorithms which incrementally estimate global scene models are best placed to take full advantages of its properties. Here, we show for the first time that an event stream, with no additional sensing, can be used to track accurate camera rotation while building a persistent and high quality mosaic of a scene which is super-resolution accurate and has high dynamic range. Our method involves parallel camera rotation tracking and template reconstruction from estimated gradients, both operating on an event-by-event basis and based on probabilistic filtering."

In the design, three parameters, filter order, oversampling ratio (OSR) and l/sub 1/-norm of the impulse response are specified, and the in-band peak of the amplitude response is minimized under the specification. The design problem is formulated as a linear minimax problem, in which the stability condition limits the l/sub 1/-norm of the impulse response of the NTF. The proposed algorithm can fast and efficiently solve the problem by iteratively utilizing the simplex method. In numerical examples, it is confirmed that the proposed algorithm can design near optimum /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators and besides is far faster and more efficient than the conventional design methods. Besides, by the proposed algorithm simulation results reveal the existence and achievable performance of rigorously stable /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulators up to the order 199. Then it is revealed that a single-bit /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator for OSR 64 can have an in-band peak amplitude -96.2[dB], while rigorously ensuring the stability, and this modulator achieves a high SNDR 107.6[dB] for a sinusoidal input signal.

The circuit output is a digital PWM signal whose frequency encodes absolute intensity and whose duty cycle encodes the relative photodiode current. This signal is formed by a self-timed circuit that alternately discharges the top and bottom photodiodes. This circuit was fabricated in a standard 3M 2P 0.5 mum CMOS process. Monochromatic stimulation shows that the duty cycle varies between 50% and 7% as the photon wavelength is varied between 400 nm to 750 nm. The output frequency is 150 Hz at incident irradiance of 1.7 W/m 2 . Chip-to-chip variation of PWM duty cycle and frequency is about 1% measured over 5 chips. Power consumption is 20 muW. A modified version of this circuit could form the basis for simple color vision sensors built in widely-available vanilla CMOS.
584395,21220,8494,A time-series processor for sonar mapping and novelty detection,2003,"A time-series processor chip, intended for sonar mapping and novelty detection applications, has been designed, fabricated and tested. The chip, when coupled with a sonar bearing and range estimation unit, receives an image of the environment as a voltage waveform. The bearing of an object is given by the magnitude of the signal, while its range is given by its time following the transmission of the sonar 'ping'. The chip stores this voltage waveform in a bank of sample-and-hold (S/H) elements and compares it to a previously stored trace. Objects that move in either azimuth or range are immediately detected and reported. The chip contains 54 S/H elements that are triggered by an on-board timer. The change detector can detect motion in bearing and range of 10 degrees/s and 11 cm/s, respectively. The maximum range is approximately 5 m. Operating in the CMOS subthreshold region of operation, the novelty detection chip is designed for ultra-low power and micro-footprint smart surveillance systems. Implemented in a CMOS 0.5 um process, it consumes less than 20 uW @ 8 Hz repetition rate (and less than 6 uW quiescent) with a 3 V supply and occupies less than 0.3 sq. mm."
1868495,21220,8494,Low-power high-Q NEMS receiver architecture,2005,"A new low-power RF receiver architecture that facilitates the use of on-chip high-Q nano-electro-mechanical (NEM) resonators for channel selection at RF is presented. Integration of high-Q RF filters in future low-power receivers is inevitable. The idea of using high-Q filters is investigated by two approaches. One is determining the requirements of high-Q filters in a narrow-band RF receiver. The other is studying the effect of these filters on the receiver in terms of reducing the power consumption of the blocks, such as LNA, mixer and VCO. The nonlinearity and power consumption of the low-IF receiver with and without RF NEMS filters is analyzed. The target application is 900 MHz GSM, and the high-Q NEMS filters are used as the front-end channel selectivity filters with Q/spl sim/3000 at 900 MHz for selecting channels with bandwidth of 200 kHz. This attenuates interferers and blockers entering the desired signal channel in the receiver, resulting in lowering the required dynamic range, linearity, IIP2 and IIP3, and therefore the power consumption of the receiver. The paper aims to create a link between research on high-Q RF filters and research on low-power RF circuit design. The discussion provides a measure for the benefits of employing high-Q NEMS filters at RF."
1586676,21220,8494,FPGA implementation of a large-number multiplier for fully homomorphic encryption,2013,"The first plausible scheme of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), introduced by Gentry in 2009, was considered a major breakthrough in the field of information security. FHE allows the evaluation of arbitrary functions directly on encrypted data on untrusted servers. However, previous implementations of FHE on general-purpose processors had very long latency, which makes it impractical for cloud computing. The most computationally intensive components in the Gentry-Halevi FHE primitives are the large-number modular multiplications and additions. In this paper, we attempt to use customized circuits to speedup the large number multiplication. Strassen's algorithm is employed in the design of an efficient, high-speed large-number multiplier. In particular, we propose an architecture design of an 768K-bit multiplier. As a key compoment, an 64K-point finite-field fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor is designed and prototyped on the Stratix-V FPGA. At 100 MHz, the FPGA implementation is about twice as fast as the same FFT algorithm executed on the NVIDA C2050 GPU which has 448 cores running at 1.15 GHz but at much lower power consumption."
1274908,21220,8494,High-Speed Parallel Hardware Architecture for Galois Counter Mode,2007,"Parallel hardware architecture for an authenticated encryption mode GCM (Galois counter mode) capable of a throughput higher than 100 Gbps is proposed. In GCM, the CTR mode can encrypt multiple data blocks independently, but a hash function performs multiply-add operation with the cipher-text blocks sequentially. Therefore, a parallel multiply-adder was designed and integrated into the GCM hardware with a 14-stage pipelined AES circuit and two kinds of S-box, composite field and BDD (binary decision tree) versions. Performance of a 4-parallel version was evaluated by using a 0.13-mum CMOS standard cell library, and very high throughputs of 102 Gbps with 600 Kgates and 162 Gbps with 979 Kgates were obtained by the composite and BDD S-boxes, respectively. Higher hardware efficiency (throughput/gate) in comparison with prior art was also achieved. The critical path of the design is the multiply-adder in each local processing block, and is not affected by the number of the parallel blocks. Therefore the proposed architecture has almost linear scalability in terms of hardware speed versus size."
304566,21220,8494,Interface circuitry for CMOS-based monolithic gas sensor arrays,2003,"Interface circuitry for single-chip gas sensor arrays fabricated in industrial CMOS technology combined with post-CMOS micromachining is presented. Two exemplary designs are detailed. The first one includes three polymer-based transducers and their read-out circuitry: a mass-sensitive resonant beam oscillator, a capacitive sensor incorporated into a second-order /spl Sigma//spl Delta/-modulator, and a calorimetric sensor with low-noise signal conditioning circuitry. Furthermore, the preprocessed sensor signals are converted to the digital domain already on chip. An additional integrated controller sets the sensor parameters and transmits the sensor values to an off-chip data recording unit via a standard serial interface. The second chip demonstrates monolithic integration of metal-oxide (SnO/sub 2/)-covered micro-hotplates along with the necessary driving and signal-conditioning circuitry. The on-chip temperature controller regulates the temperature of the membrane up to 350/spl deg/C and a logarithmic converter was included to measure the SnO/sub 2/ resistance change upon gas exposure."
2191907,21220,8494,A current-mode DTCNN universal chip,1994,"The paper describes an analog current mode realization of Discrete-Time Cellular Neural Networks (DTCNNs) with high cell density, which have local analog and local logic memory. Hence, some important parts of the CNN Universal Machine concept are implemented. The computation speed can be adjusted simply to the application by changing the clock rate. The circuit components are described in detail and SPICE level 2 simulation results are given for the ORBIT 2.0 /spl mu/m process. A layout has been designed for a chip with 12 by 12 cells on a square grid realizing a one-neighborhood with 9 feedback and 9 control coefficients. The cell size is 619 /spl mu/m by 425 /spl mu/m and the simulated speed is between 1 MHz and 10 MHz depending on the minimum value of the state current. For the latter this leads to a simulated performance of 25.9 10/sup 9/ XPS for a single chip operation with an effective area of 0.379 cm/sup 2/ and a worst case power consumption of 0.86 W. Another important feature of the chip is its capability for a spatial cascaded connection. >"
325027,21220,8494,On the VLSI implementation of the international data encryption algorithm IDEA,1995,"This paper describes a new VLSI realization of the International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA. The presented VLSI architecture is compared with the VINCI chip, the first silicon realization of the IDEA. Principal design aspects are also discussed. Although the VINCI circuit can be used for real-time encryption in high-speed networks such as ATM, there are requirements for VLSI circuits with faster encryption ability. Further, the implemented test during the normal operation in the VINCI chip cannot detect all possible errors. The proposed new implementation is motivated by the requirement for higher data rates and a new solution for the on-line test problem, which is a main task in implementing cryptographic algorithms. First design results show that the resulting circuit can achieve an encryption rate of about 355 Mb/s. This is achieved by the implementation of one round in a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The architecture includes a concurrent self-test based on a mod-3 residue code self-checking system which allows the detection of permanent and temporary single- and multiple-bit errors in the IDEA datapath and hence the secure prevention of faulty encrypted or decrypted data."
310234,21220,8494,A fast dual symbol context-based arithmetic coding for MPEG-4 shape coding,2004,"MPEG-4 shape coding comprises context-based arithmetic encoding (CAE) as its centerpiece. Since the CAE algorithm has complicated coding procedure and strong data dependency, it is hard to exploit its pipeline and parallel facilities. This paper presents a fast dual symbol CAE that runs at a higher clock rate whereas requires less clock cycle count for encoding. The proposed design is based on the unique characteristics of shape information as well as the numerical properties of the probabilities indexed by the contexts, and it is capable of encoding either a singe symbol or two symbols within each clock cycle. Together with the adaptive predication for the order of coding process, redundant operations can be skipped and therefore the average clock cycles for each coding process is improved by a factor of 1.72. Furthermore, the probability table is rearranged to reduce critical path delay. When synthesized from Verilog RTL design by using TSMC 0.35 /spl mu/m 1P4M CMOS technology, the design with I/O pads occupies an area of 2528/spl times/2520 /spl mu/m/sup 2/and is capable of running at 100 MHz."
1690679,21220,8494,Depth-aided exemplar-based hole filling for DIBR view synthesis,2013,"Quality of synthesized view by Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) highly depends on hole filling, especially for synthesized view with large disocclusion. Many hole filling methods are proposed to improve the synthesized view quality and inpainting is the most popular approach to recover the disocclusions. However, the conventional inpainting either makes the hole regions blurred via diffusion or propagates the foreground information to the disoclusion regions. Annoying artifacts are created in the synthesized virtual views. This paper proposes a depth-aided exemplar-based inpainting method for recovering large disoclusion. It consists of two processes, warped depth map filling and warped color image filling. Since depth map can be considered as a grey-scale image without texture, it is much easier to be filled. Disoccluded regions of color image are predicted based on its associated filled depth map information. Regions with texture lying around the background have higher priority to be filled than other regions and disoccluded regions are filled by propagating the background texture through the exemplar-based inpainting. Thus artifacts created by diffusion or using foreground information for prediction can be eliminated. Experimental results show texture can be recovered in large disocclusions and the proposed method has better visual quality compared to existing methods."
2856917,21220,8494,Autonomous smartwatch with flexible sensors for accurate and continuous mapping of skin temperature,2016,"Epidermal sensors, which form an intimate and robust contact with the skin, are capable of providing clinically relevant information about cardiovascular health, electrophysiology and dermatology with high accuracy and in an unobtrusive manner. To enable clinical applications, however, continuous and long-term monitoring is necessary. In addition, wireless and energetically autonomous systems are highly desirable to eliminate the needs of tethers and cables for powering and data transmission. Such requirements call for devices that combine accurate and precise sensing with high performance electronics for signal treatment, communication and power management in formats which conformal laminate on the body. In this work, we present a novel system whose design leverages on the recent developments in low power wearable devices and flexible sensors. It consists of an ultra-low power smartwatch connected to flexible solar modules assembled on a strap and an array of epidermal temperature sensors which are mounted on the wrist. Preliminary experiments show how this platform is well-suited for long-term, accurate and continuous mapping of the temperature of the skin."
2123830,21220,8494,"Bio-inspired nano-photodiode for Low Light, High Resolution and crosstalk-free CMOS image sensing",2011,"Previous attempts have been devoted to mimic biological vision intelligence at the architectural system level. In this paper, a novel imitation of biological visual system intelligence is suggested, at the device level with the introduction of novel photodiode morphology. The proposed bio-inspired nanorod photodiode puts the depletion region length on the path of the incident photon instead of on its width, as the case is with the planar photodiodes. The depletion region has a revolving volume to increase the photodiode responsivity, and thus its photosensitivity. In addition, it can virtually boost the pixel fill factor (FF) above the 100% classical limit due to decoupling of its vertical sensing area from its limited planar circuitry area. Furthermore, the suggested nanorod photodiode photosensitivity is analytically proven to be higher than that of the planar photodiode. We also show semi-empirically that the responsivity of the suggested device varies linearly with its height; this important feature has been confirmed using Sentaurus simulation. The proposed nano-photorod is believed to meet the increasingly stringent High-Resolution-Low-Light (HRLL) detection requirements of the camera-phone and biomedical imaging markets."
2852626,21220,8494,A current controlled oscillator based readout front-end for neurochemical sensing in 65nm CMOS technology,2016,"This paper presents the design of an integrated current-controlled oscillator (CCO) based readout front-end for neurochemical sensing applications. The readout front-end chip is implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology and occupies an area of 0.059 mm2. The proposed design supports an input current range of 1.2 μA (±600 nA) and can also be configured to support wider current range. The CCO-based structure utilized in this design results in noise averaging of the detected neurochemical input signal due to its inherent ΔΣfirst-order noise shaping and anti-alias filtering characteristics. Thus, the prototype chip achieves a current resolution of 100 pA and can detect dopamine concentrations as small as 10 μMol based on measured data from novel diamond-like carbon electrodes. In addition, the digital codes obtained from the readout front-end attain a signal-to-noise (SNR) of 82 dB and linearity limited effective-number-of-bits (ENOB) of 8 at full current range input, without employing any calibration or linearization techniques. The proposed read-out front-end consumes 33.7 μW of power in continuous operation."
1680420,21220,8494,Translayer optimized co-design of in-space microwave based wireless power transfer,2010,"In space applications, system designs involve a particularly thorough assessment of performance, reliability and stability, as failure cost increases very significantly at each design stage. This effort has to be stressed when evaluating the feasibility of an innovative concept such as an In-Space Wireless Power Tansmission (WPT) link. In this context, this work addresses modelling/characterizing the relationships between the input design variables at subsystem level upon complete system-level performance metrics, thereby stablishing a translayer bridge between different system levels of a WPT link based on microwave RF power. The proposed design-oriented modelling framework allows to derive optimum design, which is of particular interest if a comparison of different alternative WPT methods is to be eventually addressed. The microwave WPT link is finally designed by solving the convex optimization problem of maximizing a set of target performance metrics compressed in a single merit figure, considering as the input design space the open design variables associated to the subsystem descriptions. The presented approach yields a design showing the feasibility of the WPT link with a required power of 100W from 0 to 100 meters with an efficiency range from 15% to 45%."
1463243,21220,8494,Line-based distributed coding scheme for onboard lossless compression of high-resolution stereo images,2013,"On board compression coding of remote sensing images requires simple encoder and small storage, etc. However, the existing scheme such as JPEG2000 which is based on DWT has a complex encoder, and many algorithms based on DWT with a lower storage requirement have been researched. In this paper, we propose a novel line-based distributed lossless compression scheme for remote sensing stereo images with low storage costs and light complexity at the encoder. All the lines are encoded independently so that the required storage of the encoder is only one line. In order to achieve low encoding complexity, distributed coding techniques are used to exploit the spatial correlation and inter-view correlation of the stereo images. At the encoder, sub-sampled lines are successively encoded and transmitted. At the decoder, side information is generated with the knowledge of decoded sub-sampled lines and other previously decoded lines for the first view, and the second view will use the previous lines of the first view to remove the inter-view redundancy. In addition, line-based adaptive filter is performed to capture the spatial characteristics and template matching is used to remove the inter-view redundancy. Experimental results on high-resolution remote sensing stereo images demonstrate that the proposed scheme is comparable to JPEG2000 with respect to the compression performance, but with much lower encoding complexity and storage requirement."
1515832,21220,8494,DNA sequencing via electron tunneling,2012,"Fast and low-cost DNA sequencing methods would revolutionize medicine: a person could have his/her full genome sequenced so that drugs could be tailored to his/her specific illnesses; doctors could know in advance patients' likelihood to develop a given ailment; cures to major diseases could be found faster [1]. However, this goal of “personalized medicine” is hampered today by the high cost and slow speed of DNA sequencing methods. We will discuss the sequencing protocol we suggest which requires the measurement of the distributions of transverse currents during the translocation of single-stranded DNA into nanopores [2–6]. We will support our conclusions with a combination of molecular dynamics simulations coupled to quantum mechanical calculations of electrical current in experimentally realizable systems [2–6]. We will also discuss recent experiments that support these theoretical predictions. In addition, we will show how this relatively unexplored area of research at the interface between solids, liquids, and biomolecules at the nanometer length scale is a fertile ground to study quantum phenomena that have a classical counterpart, such as ionic quasi-particles and ionic “quantized” conductance [7,8]."
595507,21220,8494,Phase Locked Loop gain shaping for gigahertz operation,2004,"The paper presents a novel concept of gain shaping in charge-pump based Phase Locked Loops. The gain shaping involves processing ICO control current in two parallel paths of low and high frequency. By effectively lowering VCO gain at high frequencies, as compared to a standard design, larger immunity to noise sources is obtained. The gain shaping block introduces additional zero and pole in the PLL transfer characteristics. The resulting Type IV PLL has been designed for 2.5 GHz operation for applications in wireline communication (SONET/SDH systems), storage (Infiniband protocol) and PC interfacing (PCI-Express I/O). A new phase-frequency detector with zero dead zone was introduced. Standard VCO consisting of four stages implemented in a differential current-mode logic (CML) was used. The chip has been implemented in 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS process, dissipates 92 mW from a 1.8 V power supply. It offers over three-fold improvement in power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) compared to the standard Type III PLL."

Microscopy, vol.212, no.3, p.254-63, 2003; Dietrich, H.R.C. et al., Analytical Chemistry, vol.76, no.14, p.4112-17, 2004). We now describe how temperature sensing and control embedded in the floor of the nano-wells make it possible for us to cycle each well independently through the temperatures 92/spl deg/C, 55/spl deg/C, and 75/spl deg/C. This individual temperature cycling on nanoliter wells means that the nano-array architecture is suitable for PCR applications and that the total time needed for 30 cycles of PCR amplification could be less than five minutes. Further, we describe how, by embedding photodiodes in the floor of the wells, we can track the fluorescence associated with the melting and annealing of DNA when labeled with a suitable nucleic acid stain. Measurements performed with the fluorophores Rhodamine B and SYBR Green I have demonstrated our ability to control the temperature, measure the fluorescence, and monitor the denaturation and renaturation of DNA."
2207319,21220,8494,Design procedure for DVB-T receivers large tuning range LP filter,2008,"In this paper two different design approaches for a large tuning range LP filter for DVB-T receivers are presented. The LP filter is placed at the beginning of the receiver chain, before to the RF and base band blocks, so that the design is challenging because high out-band frequencies rejection is required while maintaining low input referred noise. Closed-loop topologies have been investigated to comply with the in-band linearity requirements. A system level analysis has been developed using a proper Matlab procedure. This procedure allows optimizing the basic filter parameters - opamp bandwidth, R and C values - in order to satisfy the filter transfer function requirements. Two different design approaches will be considered. The first proposal is based on a 2nd order biquadratic cell. High quality factor is synthesized while guaranteeing the out-of-band frequencies rejection. The second implementation is based on the cascade of two biquadratic cells with more relaxed quality factor requirement. The design is realized using the 90nm CMOS technology. The simulation results for both implementations are presented. The minimum out-of-band rejection is maintained lower than -30dB, the maximum IRN in both cases is 4nV/radicHz and the IM3 is lower than -30dB for two in-band input tones."
356830,21220,8494,Adaptivity figures of merit and K-rail diagrams - comprehensive performance characterization of low-noise amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators,2003,"Generally, analog RF front-end circuits are designed to be functional under the most stringent, fixed, operating conditions, where all the performance parameters are set by crude hardware design in a fixed way. The figures of merit, resulting from such a design approach, related to only one operating condition and to only one design point, are the already existing, standard or fixed figures of merit. However, the fact that the conditions under which the RF circuits are supposed to be functional are not fixed but rather variant, must be taken into account in both the design of front-end circuits and the characterization of their performances. Accordingly, the figures of merit referring not only to one, but to a set of operating conditions and set of design points are named adaptivity figures of merit. For that purpose, K-rail diagrams are introduced in this paper, offering the possibility for an all-round performance characterization of both adaptive voltage-controlled oscillators and adaptive low-noise amplifiers. The introduced K-rail diagrams give an explicit qualitative explanation of all the existing relations and trade-offs among RF front-end circuit performance parameters such as voltage swing, tank conductance, power consumption, phase noise and loop gain of oscillators as well as noise figure, linearity, gain and power consumption of amplifiers."
1698490,21220,8335,Modeling and optimization of low power resonant clock mesh,2015,"Power consumption is becoming more critical in modern integrated circuit (IC) designs and clock network is one of the major contributors for on-chip power. Resonant clock has been investigated as a potential solution to reduce the power consumption in clock network by recycling the energy with on-chip inductors. Most of the previous resonant clock work focuses on H-tree structures, while in this work, we propose a modeling and optimization method for the mesh structure, which suffers from the high power consumption more seriously than the tree structure. Closed-form expressions for the transfer function, skew, and power are derived. Based on these expressions, impacts of design factors, such as the buffer size, LC tank location, grid size, wire width, and the sparsity of buffers and LC tanks, are fully explored to make trade-offs among power, skew, and area, which can be used as design guidelines for top level resonant clock mesh in early design stages. The exploration is also extended to 3D ICs and different mesh structures are evaluated. Matlab-based implementation of the proposed simplified circuit model can achieve over 105 times speedup compared to SPICE-based simulation."
1904056,21220,9078,Affine motion estimation using a neural network,1995,"A neural network based motion-estimation technique (for successive video frames) is developed that is applicable to purely translational as well as affine movements. In addition to yielding highly accurate results, a benefit of this technique is the elimination of fractional-pixel interpolation and corresponding search. The technique is formulated in terms of a modified Hopfield neural network. The procedure consists of two stages: estimation of the neural network parameters from the present and previous frames, followed by the estimation of the affinity weights for the candidate macroblocks. The reconstructed macroblock then consists of the sum of the candidate macroblocks weighted by their affinity values as defined. Experiments on translational motion indicate that this technique produces a 5 dB higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) than the full search algorithm, 6 dB higher than the logarithmic block matching algorithms, and 2 dB higher than some of the very recent motion estimation algorithms. Preliminary experiments using the neural network affine algorithm on synthetically sheared images produce an 11 dB higher PSNR than the full search and LBM. Further, due to the neural network's fault tolerant nature and inherent parallelism, potential exists for VLSI implementation as an interconnection of small cells on a single chip."
2021183,21220,8494,An FCC compliant pulse generator for IR-UWB communications,2006,"In Haddad et al. (2004), we have shown that it is feasible to design filters with arbitrary waveform responses and therefore we propose an ultra-wideband pulse generator incorporating a filter with a Daubechies' impulse response (i.e. maximally flat over the desired frequency range). This pulse generator is co-designed with wideband antennas. An eight-order Pade approximation of its transfer function is selected to implement the FCC stipulated frequency spectrum. Subsequently, the orthonormal (Johns et al., 1989) form is adopted, which is intrinsically semi-optimized for dynamic range, has low sensitivity to component mismatch, high sparsity and whose coefficients can be physically implemented. Each coefficient in the state-space description of the orthonormal ladder filter is implemented at circuit level using a novel 2-stage gm cell employing negative feedback. Simulation results in IBM's CMOS 0.13/spl mu/m technology show that this pulse generator requires a total current of 25mA from a 1.2V power supply. The frequency coverage of the simulated waveform is about 85% of the FCC mask."
1846291,21220,8494,Implementation of a motion sickness evaluation system based on EEG spectrum analysis,2011,"Motion sickness is a normal response to real, perceived, or even anticipated movement. People tend to get motion sickness on a moving boat, train, airplane, car, or amusement park rides. Motion sickness occurs when the body, the inner ear, and the eyes send conflicting signals to the brain. Sensory conflict theory that came about in the 1970's has become the most widely accepted theorem of motion-sickness among scientists [1]. The theory proposed that the conflict between the incoming sensory inputs could induce motion-sickness. However, some new research studies have appeared to tackle the issue of the vestibular function in central nervous system (CNS). In the previous human subject studies, researchers attempt to confirm the brain areas involved in the conflict in multi-modal sensory systems by means of clinical or anatomical methods. Our past studies had investigated the EEG activities correlated with motion sickness in a virtual-reality based driving simulator. We found that the parietal, motor, occipital brain regions exhibited significant EEG power changes in response to vestibular and visual stimuli. Based on these experimental results, we attempt to implement an EEG-based evaluation system to estimate subject's motion sickness level upon the major EEG power spectra from these motion sickness related brain area in this study. The evaluation system can be applied to early detect the subject's motion sickness level and prevent the uncomfortable syndromes occurred in advance in our daily life."
1355440,21220,9475,Adaptation of consensus penalty terms for attitude synchronization of spacecraft formation with unknown parameters,2013,"The main concern of this work is on the temporal adjustment of the consensus weights, as applied to spacecraft formation control. Such an objective is attained by dynamically enforcing attitude synchronization via coupling terms included in each spacecraft controller. It is assumed that each spacecraft has identical dynamics but with unknown inertia parameters and external disturbances. By augmenting a standard adaptive controller that accounts for the unknown parameters, made feasible via an assumption on parametrization, with adaptation of the consensus weights, one opts to improve spacecraft synchronization. The coupling terms, responsible for enforcing synchronization amongst spacecraft, are weighted dynamically in proportion to the disagreement between the states of the spacecraft. The time adjustment of edge-dependent gains as well as the special cases of node-dependent and agent-independent constant gains are derived using Lyapunov redesign methods. The proposed adaptive control architecture which allows for adaptation of both parameter uncertainties and consensus penalty terms is demonstrated via extensive numerical studies of a four-spacecraft network with limited connectivity. By considering the sum of deviation-from-the-mean and rotational kinetic energy as appropriate metric for synchronization, the numerical studies also provide insights on the choice of optimal edge-dependent consensus gains."
1663865,21220,8494,Guaranteeing spike arrival time in multiboard & multichip spiking neural networks,2010,"Large-scale spiking neural networks (SNN) are generally run on distributed and parallel architectures with multiple computation nodes. These architectures induce extra delays due to the node-to-node communication process. In multiboard & multichip SNNs, important delays may affect spike arrival time and, thus, can alter simulation results. In this work, we propose a method aiming to guarantee spike arrival time with arbitrary prefixed deadlines. The communication architecture is based on the token-passing access policy to grant access to shared communication channels. We show that several network parameters must be set carefully if spikes have to meet their deadlines. Parameters are chosen by taking into account the communication channel bandwidth, the arbitrary deadlines and the worst case situation that can happen in generating neural activity in SNNs. As proof of concept, we have built a system that emulates up to 120 analog Hodgkin-Huxley neurons spread across 6 boards. Experimental results show that whatever it happens (unless there is a network fault), spikes reach their destination with a maximum delay of 5 microseconds."

The proposed DAC is composed of a unit current-cell matrix for the 8 MSBs and a binary-weighted array for the 4 LSBs, trading-off linearity, power consumption, chip area, and glitch energy with this process. Low-glitch switch driving circuits are employed to improve linearity and dynamic performance. The DAC current sources are laid out separately from the current-cell switch matrix core block to reduce transient noise coupling. The prototype DAC is implemented in a 0.35 /spl mu/m n-well single-poly quad-metal CMOS technology and the measured DNL and INL are within /spl plusmn/0.75 LSB and /spl plusmn/1.73 LSB at 12 bit, respectively. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is 64 dB at 100 MS/s with a 10 MHz input sinewave. The DAC dissipates 91 mW at 3 V and occupies an active die area of 2.2 mm/spl times/2.0 mm."
322170,21220,8494,Fault-tolerant ripple-carry binary adder using partial triple modular redundancy (PTMR),2015,"Integrated circuit chips fabricated using nano-scale CMOS technologies will be prone to errors caused by fluctuations in threshold voltage, supply voltage, electromigration, random dopant fluctuations, aging, timing errors and soft errors. Design of nano-scale failure-resistant systems has drawn significant interest in past few years. One common approach to reducing errors is the use of triple modular redundancy (TMR). The hardware overhead associated with TMR is significantly high. This paper presents a novel partial triple modular redundancy (PTMR) approach that achieves the same or better fault-tolerance as that of TMR but with significantly less hardware overhead. In a weighted number system, the most significant bits carry greater weight and preserving these bits is more critical than the lower significant bits. In PTMR, only the P most significant bits of the result are computed using TMR as opposed to all the W bits, where W represents the word-length of the operands. The proposed PTMR approach is illustrated in the context of a ripple-carry adder. It is shown that the hardware overhead can be reduced by 75% to 87.5% with P = 4 as the word-length varies from 16 to 32, with average error power equal to or less than that of TMR. It is shown that P = 3 or 4 is sufficient for word-lengths varying from 16 to 32."
834624,21220,8494,Implementation of enhanced CDMA utilizing low complexity joint detection with iterative processing,2010,"Computationally efficient joint detection in CDMA packetized communication is considered. The joint detection is based on iterative cancellation and utilizes only low complexity individual data receivers. The savings in complexity compared to other alternatives proposed in the literature is due to an encoding scheme known as partition spreading that can be decoded using algorithms that are similar to well-known turbo and sum-product decoding. Besides having a low computational complexity, the technique offers near-far resistant performance and can achieve higher system loads than conventional CDMA. The low complexity of these component receivers allows a large number of users to be implemented onto a single FPGA. A Virtex-IV on a Lyrtech Development board is used to implement a test bed for this PS-CDMA system. The implementation focuses on area optimization to give 50 users in a single Virtex-IV with 84% slice utilization and a maximum aggregate throughput of 192Mb/s. The measured performance of this prototype is compared against theoretical results on PS-CDMA in environments with varying power levels. An FPGA resource-performance analysis is given."
587927,21220,8494,Motion-assisted rate control for ME/MC-based codecs [video coding],2005,"We propose motion-assisted rate control (MARC), a scheme that utilizes local statistics of motion vectors and motion-compensated error signals. Since human perception on macroblocks with motion is different from that on macroblocks that belong to static part of a frame, the usage of motion statistics can potentially provide useful information regarding how to distribute effectively the available bit budget. A sensitivity value is calculated out of local motion information and complementary texture information for each macroblock in a frame and this value is used to compose a sensitivity map for each frame. MARC utilizes this map for bit assignment in rate control. Since a motion estimation/compensation (ME/MC)-based video codec already generates the motion and texture information required, the calculation overhead is minimal. Although MPEG-2 is used in our experiments, MARC has potential to be adopted in any ME/MC video codec with little effort. Since it only enhances the encoding procedure, compatibility with standard codecs is preserved. Although it is designed to enhance the subjective quality of moving/interesting objects within a frame, through our experiments it is found that the objective quality (PSNR) is also improved."

However, those level converters may cause the propagation delays and power consumption. In order to eliminate the overhead of level conversion, a dual-edged triggered explicit-pulsed level converting flip-flop (DETEP-LCFF) with a wide operation range is proposed. It is composed of a clock pulse generator and a modified differential cascode voltage switch with pass gate (DCVSPG) latch. The clock pulse generator has the symmetric pulse triggering time and holding period helping shorten the D-Q delay. By employed diode-connected PMOS transistors and two NMOS transistor stacked below the diode PMOS transistors, the proposed DETEP-LCFF can be operated from near-threshold region to super-threshold region. It is implemented in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. It functions correctly across all process corners with a wide input voltage range, from 400mV to 1V. The proposed LCFF has a minimum D-Q delay of 781ps, a setup time of - 610ps, and a power dissipation of 2.3μW when the input voltage is 0.4V."
590908,21220,8494,Decision making and perceptual bistability in spike-based neuromorphic VLSI systems,2015,"Understanding how to reproduce robust and reliable decision making behavior in neuromorphic systems can be useful for developing information processing architectures in subthreshold analog circuits as well as future emerging nano-technologies, that comprise inhomogeneous and unreliable components. To this end, we explore the computational properties of a recurrent neural network, implemented in a custom mixed signal analog/digital neuromorphic chip, for realizing perceptual decision-making, bi-stable perception, and working memory. The chip comprises conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons and configurable synapses with realistic dynamics. These circuits are configured to implement a recurrent neural network, composed of excitatory and inhibitory pools of silicon neurons coupled with local excitation and global inhibition. We show how the interplay between excitation and inhibition produces competitive winner-take-all dynamics, which is a feature of decision-making and persistent activity models, and demonstrate that the system generates reliable dynamics capable of reproducing both neuro-physiological data and psycho-physical performances in coding and collective distributed computation."

The ability to continuously process incoming signals allows constant monitoring of the spectrum under interest, which is critical for radar signal tracking. Architectural improvements yield a 99.5% reduction in the amount of hardware used for storage and processing for the Hilbert transform component alone. Data throughput rate of the Hilbert transform increased by a factor of eighty from a single bitstream at 32 mega bits per second (Mbps) to eight bitstreams at 320 Mbps each. The maximum combined throughput rate possible of all eight channels after place and route is estimated at 4264 Mbps and verified for 3200 Mbps.

1742761,21220,8494,An improved analysis and design methodology for RF Class-E power amplifiers with finite DC-feed inductance and switch On-resistance,2012,"Previous analytical efforts to incorporate the impact of finite switch ON-resistance into the design procedure of Class-E power amplifiers (PAs) have imposed one or both of the so-called “Class-E switching conditions”, namely zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero derivative of voltage at switching (ZDVS). These are essential for high efficiency operation only in the absence of losses. In this work, more general design equations have been derived without imposition of either ZVS or ZDVS. The optimal design is found to exhibit neither ZVS nor ZDVS, thereby validating the analysis. For the first time, an attempt has been made to incorporate the input power into the analysis, which facilitates optimization of power-added efficiency (PAE). The resulting designs exhibit better performance in terms of output power and PAE compared to existing design approaches. The analytical results have been verified through Spectre-RF simulations at 5GHz in 0.18µm and 65nm CMOS. Through this design procedure, we further demonstrate that Class-E PAs at 5GHz based on thick-oxide devices in 0.18µm CMOS, despite their lower speed, outperform those based on 65nm CMOS devices due to their higher voltage-handling capability."
2052557,21220,8494,A real-time systolic array processor implementation of two-dimensional IIR filters for radio-frequency smart antenna applications,2008,"High-speed radio-frequency (RF) applications of 2D HR real-time spatio-temporal digital filters in smart antenna arrays require architectures that are capable of high throughputs. A novel systolic-array architecture is proposed for such filters that operate at a throughput of one-frame-per-clock-cycle (OFPCC). This architecture uses a 2D extension of a well-known ID look-ahead (LA) speed maximization technique to achieve low critical path delays. A method is proposed, simulated, implemented and tested for the broadband beamforming of temporally down-converted RF signals. Temporal down-conversion is used in direct-conversion receivers, implying potential wireless applications. The prototype is operational on a Xilinx 4vsx35ff668-10 FPGA device at a clock frequency of 100 MHz, thereby achieving the required real-time OFPCC frame rate of 100 Million frames/sec. Implementations using high-speed VLSI technologies are envisaged and will facilitate 2D IIR filtering at GHz frame-rates."
1804397,21220,8494,Bit-parallel Multiple Constant Multiplication using Look-Up Tables on FPGA,2011,"The research on optimization of Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM) during the last two decades has been focusing mainly on common subexpression elimination and reduced adder graph algorithms when bit-parallel computation is required. The advancement of FPGA technology enables the implementation of complex MCM instances on FPGA, but the shift-and-add network implementation does not make full use of the fundamental resources of FPGA, like the Look-Up Tables (LUT). Since bit-serial implementation optimized for FPGA is slow, an attempt for bit-parallel LUT-based implementation for single constant multiplication has been made. This paper extends this LUT-based method to multiple constant multiplications. It presents an interesting insight and unexpected outcome that the maximal number of LUTs required can be limited far below the theoretical number by mere enumeration without considering the legitimacy of all possible output combinations. Simulation results show that the required logic slices are comparable to the traditional adder-based MCM optimization methods while the delay is reduced by approximately 33%. The advantages are more prominent with increasing number of constants and the bit width used for their representation."
1041177,21220,8494,Dynamic partial reconfigurable FFT/IFFT pruning for OFDM based Cognitive radio,2012,"Cognitive Radio is an application in which Spectrum utilization can be improved by allowing secondary users to use the spectrum when it is not used by licensed primary users. An adaptive OFDM system for Cognitive radio has the ability to nullify unnecessary individual carriers and avoid interference to licensed primary users. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) block forms the core of OFDM design. But, the zero valued inputs outnumber the non-zero valued inputs in the FFT block making the standard FFT algorithms computationally inefficient due to wasted operation on zero values. To overcome this problem, several pruning algorithms have been developed. But many of them are architecturally inefficient for FPGA implementation due to complexity of the overhead operations. Moreover, these algorithms are not suitable for applications like Cognitive radio which has zero inputs in arbitrary distributions making hardware implementation to be complex. This paper presents a novel and efficient dynamically partial reconfigurable (DPR) Transform Decomposition (TD) FFT and Radix 2 based IFFT pruning for OFDM based Cognitive Radio on FPGA. Tested FPGA results on XC2VP30 for the DPR method show the configuration time improvement, good area and power efficiency."
2442950,21220,8494,A new orthogonal online digital calibration for time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters,2008,"Modern communication technologies need faster analog- to-digital converters (ADC). To significantly increase the sampling rate of an ADC, time-interleaved ADC (TIADC) is an efficient solution. A M-channels TIADC is composed of M ADCs which operate at interleaved sampling times. Due to the manufacturing process, the main drawback of a TIADC system is that the MADCs are not exactly the same. This means that offset, gain and time mismatch errors are introduced. As a result, these errors cause distortions in the output sampled signal and introduce unwanted tones and noise, and hence, reduce the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) as well as the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a new orthogonal online digital calibration, for timing skew, offset and gain mismatches, based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique already used in communications. Our calibration is online, this means that errors can be estimated while the ADC is running. Since most of the calibration processes are carried out on the digital outputs, very little change is needed on the analog part of the ADC. Simulations results showed the efficiency of our proposed calibration architecture."
339041,21220,8494,High gain GaAs 10Gbps transimpedance amplifier with integrated bondwire effects,2003,"This paper outlines the design and performance of a GaAs MESFET MMIC front-end receiver circuit. Its main characteristics are a 17GHz bandwidth, 62dB/spl Omega/ gain and 10.3pA//spl radic/Hz input referred noise. Input sensitivity is -21dBm with a good linear response which extends to -3dBm. Tolerance to high input capacitance assures 10Gbps operation with input capacitance exceeding 260fF. Total power dissipated by the circuit is 280mW. The design approach focused on the effect of bond-wire inductance and its impact on manufacturing reliability. Special attention was given to noise analysis and optimisation, stability requirements, output impedance matching and layout. On-wafer characterization of this circuit shows good yield with high similarity among the results of different chips. Measured results for a bonded chip in a metal case agree well with simulation results, confirming the validity of the simulation models, the quality of the UMS PH15 process technology and of the proposed design."
1194221,21220,8494,A 1.5 μW NEO-based spike detector with adaptive-threshold for calibration-free multichannel neural interfaces,2013,"This paper presents a novel front-end circuit for detecting action potentials in extracellular neural recordings. By implementing a real-time, adaptive algorithm to determine an effective threshold for robustly detecting a spike, the need for calibration and/or external monitoring is eliminated. The input signal is first pre-processed by utilising a non-linear energy operator (NEO) to effectively boost the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spike feature of interest. The spike detection threshold is then determined by tracking the peak NEO response and applying a non-linear gain to realise an adaptive response to different spike amplitudes and background noise levels. The proposed algorithm and its implementation is shown to achieve both accurate and robust spike detection, by minimising falsely detected spikes and/or missed spikes. The system has been implemented in a commercially available 0.18μm technology requiring a total power consumption of 1.5μW from a 1.8 V supply and occupying a compact footprint of only 0.03 mm 2  silicon area. The proposed circuit is thus ideally suited for highchannel count, calibration-free, neural interfaces."
2098989,21220,8494,Sensitivity analysis of pulse-width jitter induced noise in continuous-time delta-sigma modulators to out-of-band blockers in wireless receivers,2011,"This paper investigates the sensitivity of continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), candidate architectures for multi-standard and software-defined radio receivers, to feedback pulse-width jitter (PWJ) in presence of blocker signals received at the ADC input. A comparison between delta-sigma modulators with feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) loop filter structures in terms of robustness to digital-to-analog converter (DAC) PWJ, in presence of blockers, is performed. Analysis and discussions developed in the paper are verified by CT simulations in Matlab/Simulink® and simulations results show good agreement with the theoretical expectations. It is shown that the PWJ induced errors due to out-of-band (OOB) blockers in the feedback path dominate the total in-band noise power (IBN) in FF delta-sigma structures and can cause a reduction in the achievable dynamic range that can be as large as 12 dB (2 bits of resolution) in case of using a non-return-to-zero DAC waveform. On the other hand, for same blocker levels at the modulator input, PWJ induced errors caused by OOB blockers have negligible contribution to the IBN in FB structures, owing to their stronger low-pass filtering characteristic and hence higher attenuation of OOB blockers."
950252,21220,8335,Hardware architecture design of an H.264/AVC video codec,2006,"H.264/AVC is the latest video coding standard. It significantly outperforms the previous video coding standards, but the extraordinary huge computation complexity and memory access requirement make the hardwired codec solution a tough job. This paper describes the design methodology for H.264/AVC video codec. The system architecture and scheduling will be addressed. The design consideration and optimization for its significant modules including bandwidth optimized motion compensation engine, reconfigurable intra predictor generator, low bandwidth parallel integer motion estimation will be mentioned. Due to the complex, sequential, and highly data-depended characteristics of all essential algorithms in H.264/AVC, not only the pipeline structure but also efficient memory hierarchy is required. The design case with a hybrid task pipelining scheme, a balanced schedule with block-level, MB-level, and frame-level pipelining, will be presented. By combining with many bandwidth reduction techniques and data reused schemes, very efficient architecture and implementation for plate-form based system is proved by the prototype chips."
385114,21220,8494,Effects of switching power converter nonidealities in envelope elimination and restoration technique,2006,"The envelope elimination and restoration (EER) technique theoretically allows implementation of linear highly efficient RF power amplifiers, as required for next generation digital communications. One of the key remaining challenges for a successful implementation of the EER technique is the efficient implementation of the switching power converter in charge of amplifying the baseband envelope signal, since bandwidths in the order of several MHz are expected for the envelopes to be tracked, hence requiring very high switching frequencies and thus compromising efficiency. This work investigates the feasibility of the EER technique by studying the impact of the nonidealities associated to the switching power converter, namely its bandwidth and ripple, upon the overall polar amplification EER scheme. Considering a two-tone test input signal, a design space exploration of the distortion associated to both nonideal effects is evaluated in terms of the output spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). Design criteria for the optimum filtering characteristic and phase compensation between polar paths are derived. The work concludes by exploring the extension of switching power converter design criteria for an actual CDMA modulation signal."
2286045,21220,8494,A filtered-X RLS based narrowband active noise control system in the presence of frequency mismatch,2005,"Rotating machines, such as fans, engines, large-scale cutting machines etc., generate noise signals of a sinusoidal nature. Narrowband active noise control (ANC) systems are effective in suppressing these noise signals. However, when the reference timing signal sensor and the cosine wave generator contain errors, the frequencies of the reference sinusoids fed to each ANC channel are different from the primary noise signal frequencies. This difference is referred to as frequency mismatch (FM). We first introduce a fast filtered-X RLS (FXRLS) algorithm to replace the filtered-X LMS (FXLMS) algorithm in the conventional parallel form narrowband ANC system, and demonstrate its improved performance without FM. Second, through extensive simulations, it is revealed that this FXRLS-based ANC system may suffer from significant performance degradation in the presence of FM. Third, the FXRLS-based system is modified to mitigate the influence of the FM by incorporating second-order AR model based adaptive blocks that are updated by an LMS or RLS algorithm. Simulations are provided to demonstrate that the modified system is robust to the existence of FM and superior to a recently developed FXLMS-based ANC system in terms of capabilities of suppressing the undesirable FM."
1861842,21220,9078,Enhanced prediction for motion estimation in Scalable Video Coding,2010,"In this paper, we present a temporal candidate generation scheme that can be applied to motion estimators in Scalable Video Codecs (SVCs). For bidirectional motion estimation, usually a test is made for each block to determine which motion compensation direction is preferred: forward, bidirectional or backward. Instead of simply using the last computed motion vector field (backward or forward), giving an asymmetry in the estimation, we involve both vector fields to generate a single candidate field for a more stable and improved prediction. This field is generated with the aid of mode decision information of the codec. This single field of motion vector candidates serves two purposes: (1) it initializes the next recursion and (2) it is the foundation for the succeeding scale in the scalable coding. We have implemented this improved candidate system for both HPPS as EPZS motion estimators in a scalable video codec. We have found that it reduces the errors caused by occlusion of moving objects or image boundaries. For EPZS, only a small improvement is observed compared to the simple candidate scheme. However, for HPPS improvements are more significant: when looking at individual levels, motion compensation performance improves by up to 0.84 dB and when implemented in SVC, HPPS slightly outperforms EPZS."
2325871,21220,8494,A MATLAB based optimum multiband FIR filters design program following the original idea of the Remez multiple exchange algorithm,2011,"A highly optimized translation of the core discrete Remez part of the Parks-McClellan (PM) algorithm from its original FORTRAN code to its MATLAB counterpart has recently been proposed by the authors. The optimization was achieved by first figuring out that the search for the “real” extremal points of the weighted error function formed based on the “trial” extremal points can be compressed into two compact search techniques and, second, by using the MATLAB strength of vectors and matrices calculations whenever possible. Most importantly, this achievement revealed that the search technique in the original PM algorithms does not follow the fundamental principle of the Remez multiple exchange (RME) algorithm. That is, if there are more candidate “real” extremal points than required, then the desired points should be selected to retain as many largest absolute values of the weighted error function as possible subject the condition that the sign of this function alternates at the consecutive points. This paper modifies the earlier MATLAB implementation of the core discrete Remez part of PM algorithm to exactly follow the above-mentioned search principle. This modification results in a highly optimized MATLAB code which outperforms the very original MATLAB code in, terms of the code compactness, the required number of iterations and CPU execution time, as is illustrated by means of several examples."
2442129,21220,11470,A highly data reusable and standard-compliant motion estimation hardware architecture,2010,"Motion Estimation (ME) is the most computationally intensive part in the whole video compression process. The ME algorithms can be divided into full search ME (FS) and fast ME (FME). The FS is not suitable for high definition (HD) frame size videos because its relevant high computation load and hard to deal with complex motions in limited search range. A lot of FME algorithms have been proposed which can significantly reduce the computation load compared to FS. Though many kinds of hardware implementations of ME have been proposed, almost all of them fail to consider about the motion vector field (MVF) coherence and rate-distortion (RD) cost which have significant impact to the coding efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hardware friendly ME algorithm and corresponding highly data reusable hardware architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed ME algorithm performs better RD performance than conventional FME algorithm. The proposed reconfigurable ME hardware is implemented in VHDL and mapped to a low cost Xilinx XC3S1500 FPGA. It works at 100MHz and is capable to process 1920 × 1080 of 30fps video format in real time and have very high data reuse ratio."
1717699,21220,8494,A simple energy efficient transceiver for IEEE 802.15.4,2010,"Power saving in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been the focus of much recent research due to the fact that the nodes are usually battery-powered. Wireless communication accounts for a strikingly high proportion of the total power consumption, so we want to reduce the power consumption by adopting a low-power transceiver in the physical layer. IEEE 802.15.4 is a popular communication standard for WSNs which has many good features that can be used for power-saving. In this paper, we propose a simple transceiver for IEEE 802.15.4. It utilizes the constant-envelope feature of the offset quadrature phase shift keying (O-QPSK) signal with half-sine shaping defined in the standard to simplify the structure of the transceiver. Compared with conventional transceivers, the proposed transceiver adopts a hard-limiter rather than a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which results in a simpler structure and lower power consumption, furthermore, the correlation operation could be efficiently implemented just by a reversible counter. The performance of the proposed transceiver is effectively demonstrated by both computer simulation and hardware test."
674379,21220,8494,Improvement of fuzzy power control for DS-CDMA cellular mobile system having variable number of users,2004,"Power control based on signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) alone usually causes a vicious circle, due to which every mobile station (MS) continuously increases its transmitted power (Tx/spl I.bar/power) to achieve the desired SIR (SIRd) in order to guarantee its quality of service (QoS). This leads to an infeasible power control problem, due to which MS transmits with the maximum power but fails to achieve the SIRd. Besides, the severity of the vicious circle problem in Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) power control systems is a function of the number of users in the system (N/sub user/); therefore, in this paper, a Fuzzy Weighting Controller (FWC) functioning to Tx/spl I.bar/power of each MS (Tx/spl I.bar/power/sup (i)/) and N/sub user/ in each cell site (N/sub user//sup (j)/) having i/sup th/ MS inside is introduced to individually weight its SIR-based power control adjusting factors output from Fuzzy Proportional-plus-Integral Controller (FPIC) in order to prevent each MS from an infeasible power control problem. Moreover, three types of N/sub user//sup (j)/ are assigned in the simulated system; i.e., 1) N/sub user//sup (j)/ is equally fixed, 2) N/sub user//sup (j)/ is equally changed, and 3) N/sub user//sup (j)/ is randomly changed. In the DS-CDMA cellular system, QoS enhancement basically reduces the system capacity; however, by solving the infeasible power control problem with the proposed algorithm, the average outage probability, the average infeasible outage probability, and the average transmitted power of each MS in all cases of N/sub user//sup (j)/ assignment, as shown in simulation results, are reduced. These show that the proposed power control algorithm can simultaneously enhance QoS and the capacity of the system."
2091595,21220,8494,Fast simulation framework for subthreshold circuits,2009,"Subthreshold voltage operation, which can be considered an extreme case of voltage scaling, can greatly reduce the power consumption of circuits. This is beneficial in embedded applications that must run off of batteries and scavenged energy. Subthreshold operation has been proven to be very effective by several successful prototypes in the recent years, yet there is no fast and effective way for designers to estimate power and delay of a design operating in the subthreshold region. Traditional gate-level simulation tools are not set up to perform timing and power analysis in the subthreshold region and transistor level simulations are very time consuming due to the accuracy required to measure the very low levels of current. This paper presents a simulation framework that can accurately characterize a circuit from nominal voltage, all the way down into the subthreshold region. This framework uses the nominal frequency and power of a target circuit and a normalized ring oscillator curve to characterize the circuit at lower voltages. The contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of this framework in the presence of a variety of design parameters such as bus lengths, transistor widths, etc. The simulation framework is extremely quick and accurate across a wide variety of circuits."
336223,21220,8494,A fast variable block size motion estimation algorithm with refined search range for a two-layer data reuse scheme,2015,"Motion estimation (ME) serves as a key tool in a variety of video coding standards. With the increasing need for higher resolution video format, the limited memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck for ME implementation. The huge data loading from external memory to the on-chip memory and the frequent data fetching from the on-chip memory to the ME engine are two major problems. To reduce both off-chip and on-chip memory bandwidth, we propose a two-layer data reuse scheme. On the macroblock (MB) layer, an advanced Level C data reuse scheme is presented. It employs two cooperating on-chip caches which load data in a novel local-snake scanning manner. On the block layer, we propose a fast variable block size motion estimation with a refined search window (RSW-VBSME). A new approach for hardware implementation of VBSME is then employed based on the fast algorithm. Instead of obtain the SADs of all the modes at the same time, the ME of different block sizes are performed separately. This enables higher data reusability within an MB. The two-layer data reuse scheme archives a more than 90% reduction of off-chip memory bandwidth with a slight increase of on-chip memory size. Moreover, the on-chip memory bandwidth is also greatly reduced compared with other reuse methods with different VBSME implementations."
231700,21220,8494,Acoustic noise reduction for speech communication: (second-order gradient microphone),1999,"Ambient acoustic noise is a significant factor for degrading speech quality of the telephone, particularly, of a digital telephone operating at low data rates. In extremely noisy environments (e.g., flight deck, high-performance aircraft, tanks, helicopters, stock exchange floor, to mention a few), speech communication would be difficult without using some form of noise reduction at the front-end of the telephone. Over the years, therefore, various noise reduction techniques have been developed to improve voice communication in noisy environments. Previous noise reduction methods focused primarily on digital preprocessing of the corrupted speech signal after it has been induced by the microphone. In this paper, we present an alternative that reduces noise while it is being mixed with speech to become corrupted speech. The noise reduction technique is based on the microphone array that is very insensitive to far-field sounds (i.e., noise), while it provides a flat frequency response for near-field sounds (i.e., speech). The microphone array is small enough to be installed within a handset or headset. The prototype we fabricated has shown excellent performance. In an extremely noisy environment where one cannot hear an adjacent person talking, the microphone array discussed in this paper provided highly intelligible speech."

The PD provides a linear characteristic that is proportional to the phase difference between the four-phase clocks and the input 5-Gb/s data, and hence produces four-demultiplexed 1.25-Gb/s outputs. The VCO is designed as a four-stage differential ring oscillator, employing the half-rate clock technique so that it can provide 1/8-rate clocks with delay interpolation. Test chips are fabricated in a 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. The whole chip occupies an area of 1.7/spl times/1.4 mm/sup 2/ together with on-chip low pass filters, i.e., two 16 pF capacitors and 63 k/spl Omega/ resistors. Post-layout simulations show that the recovered data output exhibits 40ps/sub p-p/ jitter characteristic for 2/sup 23/-1 PRBS serial NRZ input.

2171999,21220,8494,Architecture of a digital pixel sensor array using 1-bit Hilbert predictive coding,2009,"In this paper, the architecture of a digital pixel sensor (DPS) array with an online 1-bit predictive coding algorithm using Hilbert scanning scheme is proposed. The architecture of the sensor array reduces by more than half the silicon area of the DPS by sampling and storing the differential values between the pixel and its prediction, featuring compressed dynamic range and hence requiring limited precision (only 1-bit signed value in the proposed architecture as compared to 8-bit unsigned full precision). Hilbert scanning is used to read-out the pixel's value, hence avoiding discontinuity in the read-out path, which is shown to improve the quality of the reconstructed image. The Hilbert scanning path is all carried out by hardware wire connection without increasing the circuit complexity of the sensor array. Reset pixels are inserted into scanning path to overcome the error accumulation problem inherent in predictive coding. System level simulation results show a PSNR of around 25dB can be reached while using the proposed 1-bit Hilbert predictive coding algorithm. VLSI implementation results illustrate a pixel level implementation featuring a pixel size reduction of 67% with a fill-factor of 40% compared with a standard PWM DPS architecture."

In order to speed up the selection process, two suboptimal antenna subset selection schemes are proposed for the downlink of direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems under frequency selective fading. These schemes are decremental and incremental selection algorithms (DSA and ISA, respectively), which recursively drop or select one more antenna element based on the mutual information maximization criterion for different channel realizations. Moreover, the high computational complexity of matrix inversion required by these two algorithms can be further reduced by a multistage Wiener filter (MSWF) (Goldstein, J.S., IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.44, p.2943-59, 1998). Monte Carlo simulation results show that the reduced-rank DSA not only precipitates the selection process with little capacity degradation, but outperforms the full-rank ISA by 2 dB."
397641,21220,8494,State-conditioned rank-ordered filtering for removing impulse noise in images,1995,"A new framework for removing impulse noise from images is presented in which the nature of the filtering operation is conditioned on a state variable. As part of this state-based framework, several sliding-window algorithms are examined, each of which is applicable to fixed and random-valued impulse noise models. First, a simple two-state approach is described in which the current state is computed according to the output of a simple classifier that operates on the differences between the input pixel and the remaining rank-ordered pixels in the current window. Based on the value of the state variable, the algorithm switches between the output of an identity filter and an order-statistic (OS) filter. For a small additional cost in memory, this simple strategy is easily generalized into a multi-state approach using weighted combinations of the identity and OS filters in which the weighting coefficients can be optimized using image training data. Extensive simulations indicate that these methods perform significantly better in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation than a number of existing nonlinear techniques with as much as thirty percent impulse noise. Finally, the method is shown to be extremely robust with respect to the training data and the percentage of impulse noise."
2339723,21220,8494,MEMS-based all-digital frequency synthesis for ultralow-power radio for WBAN and WSN applications,2011,"This paper explores the use of MEMS devices such as bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and low frequency silicon resonators, in combination with digital circuits and techniques, to reach miniaturization and low power dissipation in a 2.4 GHz transceiver targeting wireless body area networks (WBAN) and wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications. Precise phase locking of the BAW digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to the low-frequency temperature compensated oscillator is demonstrated. Additional cancellation within the ADPLL of the deterministic jitter induced by the bi-frequency mode on the 32 kHz clock is proven, with a residual modulation on the DCO command word corresponding to ±0.5 ppm relative frequency deviation. The RF resulting after frequency up-conversion of the system IF signal with the DCO shows an excellent phase noise of −136.6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency, for a total synthesizer current consumption of 7.52 mA under 1.6 V supply. In addition, 1 Mb/s GFSK Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy modulations have been successfully validated in transmission."
1961611,21220,8494,Design of a CNFET array for sensing and control in P450 based biochips for multiple drug detection,2010,"Bio-detection specially dedicated to distributed diagnostics is emerging as a quite important application for Nano-bioelectronics. Bio-detection is required to be highly sensitive in order to succeed in sensing small amount of bio-markers in patient's blood sample. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) provides devices in the scale of the target molecules, thereby opening up possibilities to sense few bio-markers. Moreover, bio-detection is also required to be highly specific in order to succeed in disease discrimination. FET technology provides control in multi-panel biochip to enhance specificity. The aim of the present paper is to design an array of Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) to provide nano-biosensing based on cytochromes P450. In particular, a novel CNFET biosensor array design is proposed which is robust to the imperfections in the CNTs thereby achieving high level of sensitivity.

1737837,21220,8494,A 51-dB SNDR DCO-based TDC using two-stage second-order noise shaping,2012,"This paper presents a two-stage second-order noise shaping time-to-digital converter (TDC) using a one-bit digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). The clocks output from DCOs are counted and digitized as in a conventional gated ring oscillator (GRO) TDC. A time error is propagated to the second DCO, which provides second-order noise shaping. In the conventional GROTDC, internal oscillators must maintain their phase state. However, because of the leak current, the stored phase states are degraded or even lost. In our proposed architecture, the DCOs always oscillate and need not maintain their phase state. Therefore, our proposed TDC is more suitable in leaky recent process than a GROTDC is. Because no switched capacitor or opamp is used, the proposed TDC can be implemented in a small area and with low power. Mismatches in the oscillation frequency between the DCOs might occur. However, error detection and correction can be performed using a first-order least mean square (LMS) filter. In a standard 65-nm CMOS process, an SNDR of 51 dB is achievable at an input bandwidth of 3 MHz and a sampling rate of 65 MHz, where the power is 271 µW."

Our objective is to analyze and identify the correlation of the conversion gain of the mixer circuit with the signal conditions at the local oscillator as well as different device parameters, such as the gate length (L gate ), doping concentration (N A ) and body thickness (t Si ), thus minimizing signal loss and power consumption. The most important figure of merit in the mixer performance is found to be the LO DC bias that determines the level of non-linearity in the transconductance response. Furthermore, we observe that in properly designed double gate MOSFETs (L gate  ≥ 3t Si ), L gate  and N A  have limited impact on the conversion gain of the mixer, while t Si  has a more significant role to play. Although the mixing performance of double gate MOSFETs is ultimately limited by the short channel effects perpetrated by any given structural constraint, an optimum body thickness tSi exists in each case to maximize the conversion gain. Thus, we illustrate how 2D and quantum-corrected simulations can identify the optimum body thickness and optimum bias conditions in such compact nano-scale mixers."

In H.264, the better coding performance is achieved at the cost of complexity, and it is too complex to be applied widely. With the performance and complexity joint optimization method of this paper, the modules are optimized respectively in the order of their computation proportion. Adaptive hexagon-based search (AHBS) and memory motion compensation (MMC) are proposed for encoder and decoder. AHBS is about 40 times faster than full search, and a little faster than diamond search. However AHBS achieves the best coding performance: 0.4dB improvement in low motion sequences, and 0.2dB improvement in high motion sequences compared with full search. The decoding process is accelerated up to 5 times totally with proposed MMC and other optimized techniques. Therefore the efficiency of codec system is improved greatly. Optimized video codec can be used in uni-casting and broadcasting streaming applications with limited computation resource in those embedded movable devices."

They have a wide-range of commercial and military applications from video surveillance to smart home and from traffic monitoring to anti-terrorism. The design of such a visual sensor network is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the environment, self and mutual occlusion of moving objects, diverse sensor properties and a myriad of performance metrics for different applications. As such, there is a need to develop a flexible sensor-planning framework that can incorporate all the aforementioned modeling details, and derive the sensor configuration that simultaneously optimizes the target performance and minimizes the cost. In this paper, we tackle this optimal sensor problem by developing a general visibility model for visual sensor networks and solving the optimization problem via Binary Integer Programming (BIP). Our proposed visibility model supports arbitrary-shaped 3D environments and incorporates realistic camera models, occupant traffic models, self occlusion and mutual occlusion. Using this visibility model, a novel BIP algorithms are proposed to find the optimal camera placement for tracking visual tags in multiple cameras.

1084957,21220,9078,Backward view synthesis prediction for 3D-HEVC,2013,"View synthesis prediction provides an effective way to reduce inter-view redundancy of multiview video in addition to conventional disparity compensated prediction. Traditional forward warping techniques incur high complexity since an entire picture is typically warped from one viewpoint to another. To reduce this complexity, block-based backward warping is considered as an alternative solution. One difficulty with this approach is that it requires depth information of the current block prior to its encoding. To solve this problem, a novel method is proposed to derive the depth information from neighboring blocks with high accuracy. With the proposed approach, backward warping is enabled using depth information derived from either neighboring spatial (inter-view) compensated blocks or temporal compensated blocks. As a generalization, the proposed backward warping scheme is not only applied at the pixel level, but at the sub-block level as well. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves an average bitrate savings of 1.2% for coded video vs coded video bitrate, 1.1% for coded video vs total bitrate, and 1.0% for synthesized video vs total bitrate under common test conditions for 3D video coding using HEVC, with maximum gains of greater than 10% for dependent views."

The wearable gait analysis device is composed of a triaxial accelerometer, a microcontroller, and an RF wireless transmission module. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed device and algorithm, nine AD patients and three healthy controls were recruited to participate a gait analysis experiment. They were asked to mount the device on their foot and walk along a straight line of 40 meters at normal speed. The stride detection algorithm, consisting of procedures of data collection, signal preprocessing, and stride detection, has been developed for acquiring gait feature information from acceleration signals. The advantages of this wearable gait analysis device include the following: 1) It can be used anywhere without any external device, and 2) the stride detection algorithm can acquire gait feature information from acceleration signals automatically and effectively. Experimental results show that the AD patients exhibited a significantly shorter mean stride length and slower mean gait speed than those of the healthy controls. No significant differences in mean stride frequency and mean cadence were observed in the two groups. The variability in the percentage of the stance phase of the AD patients was slightly greater than that of the healthy controls. Based on the above results and discussions with physicians, we conclude that the proposed wearable gait analysis device is a promising tool for automatically analyzing gait information which can serve as indicators for early diagnosis of AD."

Compared to the conventional SAR ADC, the average switching energy and total capacitance are reduced by 97% and 75%, respectively. Asynchronous design is implemented to eliminate the conventional system clock which is N-time of sampling rate.

2515964,21220,8494,A fast chip-scale power estimation method for large and complex LSIs based on hierarchical analysis,2005,"The paper presents a novel power estimation method for large and complex LSIs. The proposed method is based on simulation and is used for analyzing the ways in which chip-scale gate-level circuits, including processors and memory, are affected by gated-clock power reduction and the voltage drop due to electrical resistance (IR-drop). Chip-scale power estimation based on simulation patterns generally takes a long time. To obtain accurate estimation results based on simulation patterns in a short time, we introduce three approaches: (1) hierarchical circuit and simulation pattern partitioning; (2) memory modeling; (3) processor modeling. First, the target LSI design, after placing and routing, is partitioned into hierarchical blocks, memory, and processors. The power consumption of each hierarchical block is calculated using the partitioned patterns generated from chip-scale simulation patterns. The power consumption of the processor and memory blocks is estimated by a method considering the static power consumption and the rate of LSI activity. The experimental results for a commercial 0.18 /spl mu/m-technology digital TV chip show that our proposed method can get almost the same results obtained by the conventional method without partitioning and can do it 25 times faster."
986337,21220,8494,A sixth-order 4–2 SMASH CIFF complex bandpass ΔΣ modulator with delaying digital input feedforward,2010,"In this paper, a sixth-order sturdy multi-stage noise shaping (SMASH) bandpass delta-sigma (ΔΣ) modulator [1] with delaying digital input feedforward (DFF) structure [2,3] is presented. The second-order ΔΣ modulator with cascade integrators and distributed feedforward (CIFF) [4] is utilized in each stage to reduce the signal swing. Hence, the requirement of opamp and the power consumption of circuits can be reduced due to the suppression of the signal swing and the discarding of the digital cancellation filters. One pair of complex zeros is designed within signal bandwidth to effectively suppress the noise floor of the presented modulator. The sub-sampling technique is adopted to reduce the clock frequency and the requirement of opamp. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the proposed SMASH CIFF bandpass ΔΣ modulator with delaying DFF structure. The proposed bandpass ΔΣ modulator compared to the single-loop AFF structure, the signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) could be increased by 12 dB, and the dynamic range (DR) could be extended by roughly 15 dB in a 200 kHz of signal bandwidth centered at 10.7 MHz."

Unfortunately, in predicting the shift amount by a conventional LZA design, the result could be off by one position. This error has to be detected and corrected by additional logic in the post-normalization process, resulting in longer critical path and impacted overall performance of the floating-point unit. The paper presents a novel algorithm, and its design, for LZA error detection. The proposed approach enables parallel execution of a conventional LZA and the error detection operation, so that the error-indication signal can be generated at an earlier stage of normalization, thus reducing the critical path and improving overall performance. In addition, the proposed LZA with parallel error detection logic can work with a general case of operands, regardless of whether a subtraction result is positive or negative. This means that the proposed scheme can be nicely adapted to the CLOSE path design of dual-path based floating-point adder (Seidel, P.-M. and Even, G., IEEE Trans. Computers, vol.53, no.2, 2004). The circuit implementation and evaluation of this algorithm are also presented."

Power consumption is reduced by implementing a fully-integrated DC-DC converter that uses a reconfigurable switched capacitor topology to provide 4 output voltages for Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS). DC conversion efficiencies of between 63% and 76% are achieved using integrated capacitances of under 1nF and the DVS approach offers power savings of up to 53.5% compared to the front end of a typical current controlled neural stimulator. A novel charge balancing method is used which has a low level of accuracy on a single pulse and a much higher accuracy over a series of pulses. The method used is robust to process and component variation and does not require any initial or ongoing calibration. Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that the charge imbalance can be less than 0.014% (at ±3σ) of charge delivered for a series of pulses. The circuit has been designed in a commercially-available 0.18µm HV CMOS technology and is estimated to require a die area of approximately 0.9mm 2  for a 16 channel implementation.
2025547,21220,8494,Supersonic flow simulation on IBM cell processor based emulated digital Cellular Neural Networks,2009,"In the area of mechanical, aerospace, chemical and civil engineering the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) has been one of the most important problems of mathematics for a long time. In this field, one of the most exciting areas is the simulation of fluid flow, which involves for example problems of air, sea and land vehicle motion. In engineering applications the temporal evolution of non-ideal, compressible fluids is quite often modeled by the system of Navier-Stokes equations. They are a coupled set of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and form a relatively simple, yet efficient model of compressible fluid dynamics. Unfortunately the necessity of the coupled multi-layered computational structure with nonlinear, space-variant templates does not make it possible to utilize the huge computing power of the analog Cellular Neural Network Universal Machine (CNN-UM) chips. To improve the performance of our solution emulated digital CNN-UM implemented on IBM Cell Broadband Engine has been used. The goal is to perform the operations with the highest possible parallelism."

These enhancements typically require incorporating higher frequency clock oscillators because the clock speed is directly proportional to the speed of the microprocessor processing the information. A higher processor speed also presents challenging problems for developing systems with low electromagnetic interference (EMI) in order to comply with the rules and regulations specified by the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC). In this paper, a gated direct sequence spread spectrum (GDSSS) clock distribution, where the original clock signal is being divided and spread over a wider frequency spectrum to reduce the radiated emissions, is proposed. A hardware including programmable logic devices and a system board with one GDSSS transmitter and three GDSSS receivers is designed to validate this new and scalable clock distribution concept. Reducing 10 dB radiated emissions greatly improved the video quality in multimedia systems without negatively affecting system timings."

Discrete and continuous wavelet transforms have been widely used in signal and multimedia processing. Due to the high performance and flexibility of reconfigurable computing systems, it is very attractive to design a re configurable architecture for discrete and continuous wavelet transform of wide range of wavelet filters. In this paper, a unified computation framework for discrete and continuous wavelet transform based on lifting scheme and a reconfigurable architecture that includes reconfigurable lifting step arrays and reconfigurable address generator are proposed. The unified framework is the theory basis of this system. The step array is the computing core of this engine.

In addition, the proposed platform-based design can seamlessly combine the MW-VET and decoder such that it can be dynamically configured to perform video decoding and transcoding alternatively or simultaneously. Furthermore, we perform the pruned design space exploration on the design of inter/intra prediction and the on-chip data bus width. Our proposed architecture provides a better tradeoff among execution cycles, hardware cost, resource utilization, and video quality because of the reconfigurable processing modules and the hybrid pipelining. As compared to the cascaded pixel domain transcoder that has the highest complexity, our hardware efficient VET can significantly reduce the hardware cost while maintaining similar rate-distortion performance.

The first technique is to use newly developed monolithically stacked 3D-IC technology for the implementation, because vertical stacking can drastically reduce interconnect length in both matchlines and searchlines, hence reducing signal path delay and power consumption. The second technique is to replace the conventional SRAM memory in a TCAM with an array of programmable vias (or electrolyte non-volatile memory). Special programming circuitry is designed to read/write memory bits from/to the programmable via array because they do not simply store data in the form of low and high voltage levels. We also devised a new TCAM cell design to further reduce power consumption in TCAMs by taking full advantage of 3D-IC technology. A 1024 times 144-bit TCAM using the proposed schemes is implemented with 1.0-V 65 nm CMOS technology.

2345128,21220,8494,"On the relation of circuit theory and signals, systems and communications",2011,"In signal processing, system theory, an in information theory signals are either complex valued waveforms or sequences of dimensionless complex numbers. The »power« of such signals is usually said to be the squared magnitude of these complex numbers. In an electrical circuit, power is always the product of voltage and current, both present at a port, i.e., at a pair of terminals. Here we ask the question: what is the relation between signal power and physical power? There are special cases, where the two notions of power are strictly proportional and, therefore, no conflict occurs. But in general, especially when we deal with vector signals, the commonly used squared Euclidean norm of the signal vector may not be a measure for the physical power associated with the voltages and currents, which correspond to the signal vector. In addition to the physically consistent computation of signal power, physically consistent modeling of the noise is crucial in all information processing systems. Again circuit theory provides with a methodology to model how the noise comes into the system. Modeling is one the most important tasks in engineering and, therefore, physically consistent modeling is very important for the education of electrical engineers. Circuit Theory is the essential framework to ensure physical consistency across several levels of abstraction."

414236,21220,8494,A novel noise optimization design technique for radio frequency low noise amplifiers,2003,"In this paper we present a novel noise optimization design technique using voltage boosting for low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). High performance FET LNAs use inductive source degeneration to generate the real part of the input impedance without using a noisy resistor. Normally the source inductance is adjusted to meet the 50 /spl Omega/ power matching condition. In this paper we show that if the source degenerating inductance value is adjusted such that the impedance is larger than the source resistance, the output noise power can be reduced. The maximum input resistance is limited by the quality factor of the gate inductor and transconductance saturation at high gate bias voltage due to short channel effects. An appropriate input resistance and device geometry can be selected to optimize the NF. The tradeoff between noise figure and linearity has also been considered. To verify our design concepts a prototype MESFET LNA with 1.65-dB noise figure and 5.2-dBm third order input intercept point has been designed and tested. It consumes 12mW from a 2.0-V power supply."

669453,21220,8494,"Design, fabrication and modeling of microbeam structures for gas sensor applications in CMOS technology",2003,"In this paper we discuss the design, fabrication, and modeling of an electrostatically actuated transducer that is operated in a resonant mode. The transducer is designed for gas sensor applications. The microstructure with high-aspect ratio laminated beam or bridge suspensions, has been fabricated using a 0.6 /spl mu/m three metal, double poly CMOS process. The fabricated chip was post processed by a sequence of two maskless dry etching steps. A thin sorbent polymer layer is included in the design of the microbeam chemical sensor. The devices were designed to provide a relatively large surface area to coat with the sorbent polymer. Gas sorption in the polymer layer can be monitored as a function of the resonant frequency of the device. The device frequency is measured by piezoresistors mounted in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The fabricated sensors are intended for use in monitoring hazardous gases and vapors. In order to optimize the device resonant frequencies, a variety of microbeam structures were designed with different dimensions. These structures were modeled with a finite element analysis program. A number of selected structures were fabricated in a single chip design."
536840,21220,8494,Compound noise analysis in digital circuits using blind source separation,2006,"In the past decade there have been significant efforts to analyze and solve signal integrity issues in pre-nanometer circuits. However, most of these techniques apply to single noise source, and cannot take into account the evolving reality of multiple noise sources interacting with each other. With the scaling of the technology into nanometer regime, maintaining historical rate of performance and signal integrity have become very challenging due to compound noise effects. Noise measurement made at an evaluation node will reflect the cumulative effect of all the active noise sources, while individual and relative severity of various noise sources will determine what types of remedial steps can be adopted, pressing the need for the development of algorithms that study the cumulative noise effects, and analyze the relative contributions of different noise sources. This paper presents a novel method to analyze the characteristics of compound noise effect in very high performance integrated circuits. The algorithm extracts the time characteristics of individual noise sources from the measured voltage in order to study the contribution of each source separately, by applying the technique of blind source separation, which is based on the assumption that the different sources of noise are statistically independent over time. The estimated noise sources can aid in timing and spectral analysis and yield better design techniques."
373661,21220,8494,A 2.7 V CMOS dual-mode baseband filter for GSM and WCDMA,2001,"A 5th order analog CMOS continuous-time baseband filter for a dual-mode cellular phone was designed with maximum component sharing in the two modes. The filter was designed to meet the bandwidth requirements of both GSM and WCDMA standards. The area was minimized by using common capacitance matrices and operational amplifiers in the two modes. Operational amplifiers with a programmable GBW were used in order to minimize the power consumption in GSM-mode. The real pole of both fifth order transfer functions was realized as a passive integrated structure and a ladder filter was used to realize the two remaining complex pole pairs. This helped to reduce the power consumption further while resulting in a very low input referred noise. A 7-step gain tuning was implemented with tunable transconductance stage between the passive RC-loop and the active ladder structure. The measured frequency responses are in good agreement with simulations. The measured integrated input referred noise was 6.9 /spl mu/V and 13.6 /spl mu/V in the GSM- and WCDMA-modes, respectively. The IIP3 was +25 dBV in the WCDMA-mode and the circuit consumed 13.0 mW and 21.8 mW in the GSM- and WCDMA-modes, respectively."
519870,21220,8494,An associative-processor-based mixed signal system for robust grayscale image recognition,2002,"An associative-processor-based VLSI system architecture has been developed for robust grayscale image recognition. The system receives a 64/spl times/64 pels block of a gray scale image, extracting a feature vector from the image and recognizing the image by template matching. An analog associative processor is adopted as the template matching core because it features compact implementation as well as fast processing due to its fully parallel architecture. For generating feature vectors, dedicated digital CMOS circuits have been developed because of their versatility in the algorithm. The analysis of medical X-ray pictures (Cephalometric landmark identification by expert dentists) was taken as an exercise for the system, and intensive computer simulations have been conducted to optimize the recognition performance of the system. Although the entire system has not yet been implemented on a single chip, all the key sub circuits in the system were fabricated as test circuits and their correct functioning has been experimentally demonstrated. It is also shown by experiment that very low power operation of the template matching core is possible by operating the analog circuitry in the subthreshold regime without degrading recognition performance."
1826461,21220,8494,Hyperspectral image coding with LVQ-SPECK,2008,"Enhanced versions of the LVQ-SPECK algorithm are presented that further exemplify the codec's good performance when dealing with multidimensional data sets. The two different alternatives might, in fact, be considered stepwise improvements over the original codec. First, an extended-range option is implemented, so that the number of spectral bands being simultaneously encoded is now a multiple of (instead of equal to) the codeword dimension. That in itself provides the means for much better rate allocation among the different bands. Then, use of the discrete wavelet transform over the spectral dimension, generating a wavelet packet decomposition of the original dataset is considered, and a substantial increase in coding performance is obtained, provided by the energy compaction characteristics of the transform. We provide results for the two different options of four-dimensional codebooks investigated, namely the shell-1 and shell-2 of the D 4  lattice, further cementing the idea that the latter is much more adept for use in this setting than the former. Finally we present comparison with other state-of-the-art codecs employed to the same task and show how competitive our proposed extensions are."
2806186,21220,20649,Invited - Airtouch: a novel single layer 3D touch sensing system for human/mobile devices interactions,2016,"Touchscreen technology plays an important role in the booming mobile devices market. Traditional touchscreen only provides 2D interactions with limited user experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D touch sensing system called the Airtouch system, which can recognize the movement of the finger in a 3-dimensional space. Half of the manufacturing cost is reduced by applying only single layer electrodes in the touch panel design. Moreover, an oscillator based correlated double sampling circuit is implemented as the self-capacitive sensor with bootstrapping technique to reduce inter-channel-coupling effect. Additionally, new algorithm for finger positioning is created with grouping filter invented to reduce system background noise. The demonstrated setup can successfully detect finger movement within a vertical range of 6cm and achieve a horizontal resolution up to 1cm. This system offers great potential in both gesture recognition for small-sized electronics, and advanced human interactive games for TV and mobile device."
2184540,21220,8494,Networked vehicles for automated fault detection,2009,"Creating fault detection software for complex mechatronic systems (e.g. modern vehicles) is costly both in terms of engineer time and hardware resources. With the availability of wireless communication in vehicles, information can be transmitted from vehicles to allow historical or fleet comparisons. New networked applications can be created that, e.g., monitor if the behavior of a certain system in a vehicle deviates compared to the system behavior observed in a fleet. This allows a new approach to fault detection that can help reduce development costs of fault detection software and create vehicle individual service planning. The COSMO (COnsensus Self-organized MOdeling) methodology described in this paper creates a compact representation of the data observed for a subsystem or component in a vehicle. A representation that can be sent to a server in a backoffice and compared to similar representations for other vehicles. The backoffice server can collect representations from a single vehicle over time or from a fleet of vehicles to define a norm of the vehicle condition. The vehicle condition can then be monitored, looking for deviations from the norm. The method is demonstrated for measurements made on a real truck driven in varied conditions with ten different generated faults. The proposed method is able to detect all cases without prior information on what a fault looks like or which signals to use."
1208389,21220,8494,Collaborative error control method for sequential logic circuits,2013,"A collaborative method is proposed to detect soft errors in combinational logic and memory elements of sequential logic circuits. The proposed match functions examine the current flip-flop values and the incoming flip-flop inputs produced by combinational logic to recognize the presence of soft errors. Conventional error control methods for sequential circuits focus on protecting the memory elements, rather than combinational logic. Unfortunately, the error rate of combinational logic is approaching that of memory elements as technology scales down. Modular redundancy approaches, such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), can simply protect both combinational logic and memory elements at the cost of large area and power. We apply the proposed collaborative method to a binary counter and one ITC'99 benchmark circuit to assess the system failure rate and error protection overhead. Gate-level simulation results show that our approach improves the system failure rate more than one order of magnitude over TMR. Synthesized netlists show that our method consumes 40% less area and 50% less power than TMR. Experimental results also show that our method achieves a comparable error detection rate to an error control coding method with 34% dynamic power reduction."

Such WDFs have directional filtering applications in space-time in areas such as ultra-wideband acoustical beamforming, video processing, and ultrasonic imaging. The implementation of zero initial conditions for both rectangular/linear arrays is considered. An example of 2 nd -order 2D IIR frequency-planar filter design and FPGA-implementation for space-time plane-wave filtering over uniform linear arrays is provided. The proposed FPGA circuit is simulated, using 2D impulse response tests and interference rejection models, to confirm correct operation of the WDF architecture. The FPGA implementation was targeted to a Xilinx Sx35–10ff668 device. Timing analysis shows a critical path delay of 145 ns, implying a real-time clock frequency of 6.9 MHz, and for 32 sensors, a linear-frame sampling frequency of 215 kHz."

Power is sent and telemetry data received over a near field inductive link. The implant system is almost completely realized on a single CMOS ASIC, excepting three surface mounted capacitors, the coil antenna and the sensor. For this demonstration, the ASIC is packaged and mounted with the 4 other components on a PCB, and the glucose sensor is substituted with either a potentiometer or an atmospheric pressure sensor. In the targeted highly miniaturized implantable micro system all components (including antenna and sensor) will be integrated into a pill sized LTCC (low temperature coflred ceramics) package. The total implant power budget with the minimal supply voltage of 2.5V is at 76µW. This number includes the power for various test structures that will be unnecessary for an industrial prototype, which is expected to operate below 20µW. A simple demonstrator of the reader is implemented on another PCB with a two digit hexadecimal LED display to show the telemetry data."

The YPR measurement modules, constructed using an elaborated Reichardt model of the fly's motion detection system, are used to measure the drift rate of features in the field of view. A variable acuity superpixellation imager (VASI), constructed using an active pixel sensor (APS) with networked integration capacitors, allows multiple high resolution foveae to be interspersed in a low resolution image of the environment. The 49 sq. mm chip, containing twelve 90-pixel linear arrays for the YPR modules and a 128/spl times/128 VASI array, is fabricated in a 0.5 /spl mu/m 2P3M CMOS process. Measured results indicate that YPR rates of over 300 pixels/second and VASI images ranging from 1/spl times/1 to 128/spl times/128, with multiple, dynamically variable foveae, can be obtained with this chip. It is intended to be used to control and navigate a MUAV, but it can also be used for visual tracking and many other multimode imaging operations."
519153,21220,8494,Modeling of layered video for low-bit-rate video conferencing applications,1999,"Heterogeneous wireless networks present several challenges for real-time video applications. Traditional video codecs are not particularly robust and perform poorly when faced with packet losses from congestion and bit errors within the channel. A combination of deterministic traffic smoothing and layered video coding techniques improves error resilience. Smoothing over single frame intervals improves statistical multiplexing gains. To mitigate a portion of the delay introduced by smoothing, we propose a predictive smoother using the RLS algorithm that reduces the delay due to encoding. Layered video coding transmits video in scalable layers of increasing quality. We present a simple hybrid wavelet/DCT layered coder along with an associated optimized layered video traffic model. The traffic model employs a simplified multistate Markov chain representing a nonuniformly quantized pseudo-histogram of observed bit-rates for each layer. The model captures the effect of deterministic smoothing and aids in evaluating scheduling algorithms as well as providing a simple call acceptance scheme."
619455,21220,8494,Plastic NNs for biochemical detection,2003,"Bio-inspired systems including neural networks (NNs) have proven to be a useful tool for biochemical electronic nose. Silicon embedded olfactory pattern recognition systems however, have been limited in scale due to inherent constraints of synapse routing and chip area. This paper presents a new plastic-based NN approach for a pseudo bloodhound nose for odorant learning and detection. The network uses spike driven plastic synapses, and is designed to accept more than 1000 inputs and detect odors via an unlimited number of outputs. The basic theory is presented, including stochastic learning and detection based on hamming distance. Simulation shows the network functions well, even in noisy environments where more than 10% of inputs are contaminated by background noise. Digital hardware implementation using VHDL shows that a representative system with 128 inputs and 8 outputs fits on a single Xilinx Virtex v1000 chip and would occupy just 0.118 mm/sup 2/ using 0.16/spl mu/m CMOS technology."
1844689,21220,8494,Fully programmable bias current generator with 24 bit resolution per bias,2006,"This paper describes an on-chip programmable bias current generator, intended for mixed signal chips requiring a wide ranging set of currents. The individual generators share a master current reference. A serial digital interface to the chip controls the biases by bits loaded into a 24-bit shift register. These bits control the steering of current from a current splitter. The summed current splitter output is actively mirrored to a broadcasted bias voltage. Measurements from an implementation in 0.35/spl mu/ 4M-2P CMOS show a total range of bias current of over 6 decades (>120 dB) ranging from a few times the off-current up to the master reference current. For currents larger than the minimum, the generator has resolution spanning nearly its full 24 bit range (144dB), e.g. for a master current of 10 /spl mu/A, any bias current can be varied by as little as 0.5 pA with the caveat that the code is not guaranteed monotonic. Each bias occupies an area of 0.026 mm/sup 2/, which is about 65% of the bonding pad that it replaces. Measured variation in generated currents is <10% in strong inversion and about 20-30% in weak inversion."

767537,21220,8494,Effective modelling of large NoCs using SystemC,2010,"The IEEE SystemC standard has been accepted as an effective high-level system modelling library among designers. However, in order to implement fast simulation models and to consider new ideas and requirements at system level, some enhancements and new features should be added to this standard. This is the reason why OSCI has proposed the TLM 1&2 libraries. In this work, we investigate a very fast but accurate and simple to use modelling methodology for systems which include a large number of modules such as complex Network-on-Chips (NoCs) which have many routers, network interfaces and processing cores. The proposed methodology implements all SystemC processes using normal functions and supports process activation simply by function calls. For this purpose, it utilises a SystemC method process that establishes concurrency and communication among the functions. The experimental results show an improvement of up to 98% in elaboration time and up to %90 in simulation time for small size NoCs. In addition, it can efficiently simulate large NoC with tens of thousands of nodes while traditional SystemC modelling based on threads struggles to simulate hundreds of nodes."

QR factorization is a fundamental module yet computationally intensive used in many MIMO detection schemes. In this paper, a complex-valued QR factorization (CQRF) scheme realized via a sequence of real-value Givens rotations is first presented. An efficient CQRF design using coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) modules is next developed. The design features a highly parallel architecture to support high throughput operations. One CQRF can be obtained in every 8 clock cycles. To reduce the circuit complexity, a pipelined CORDIC structure is also applied. The implementation results in TSMC 0.18-µm CMOS process indicate that the proposed design can achieve a throughput rate of 25MCQRFs per second while consuming only 103.7k gates in circuit complexity. Performance evaluation based on a composite index consisting of area and throughput rate also shows the advantages of the proposed design against other similar works."
2065946,21220,8494,Optimization of structural adders in fixed coefficient transposed direct form FIR filters,2009,"Over the last two decades, fixed coefficient FIR filters were generally optimized by minimizing the number of adders required to implement the multiplier block in the transposed direct form filter structure. In this paper, an optimization method for the structural adders in the transposed tapped delay line is proposed. Although additional registers are required, an optimal trade-off can be made such that the overall combinational logic is reduced. For a majority of taps, the delay through the structural adder is shortened except for the last tap. The one full adder delay increase for the last optimized tap is tolerable as it does not fall in the critical path in most cases. The criterion for which area reduction is possible is analytically derived and an area reduction of up to 4.5% for the structural adder block of three benchmark filters is estimated theoretically. The saving is more prominent as the number of taps grows. Actual synthesis results obtained by Synopsys Design compiler with 0.18µm TSMC CMOS libraries show a total area reduction of up to 13.13% when combined with common subexpression elimination. In all examples, up to 11.96% of the total area saved were due to the reduction of structural adder costs by our proposed method."
756022,21220,8494,Papoulis-Gerchberg Hybrid Filter Bank receiver for cognitive-/Software-Defined Radio systems,2013,"Emerging Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) should be prepared to deal with wide-band sparse-spectrum RF signals. This requires the availability of advanced analog-to-digital front-ends with a fast sampling rate, large dynamic range and capable of handling high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) signals. A Hybrid Filter Bank (HFB) receiver solution was recently proposed by the authors to address such demanding requirements in the SDR context, with special emphasis on the RF analog part. In this paper, as further research, a maximally-decimated five-channel HFB for its intermediate-frequency (IF) part is shown. Unlike its previously reported RF counterpart, it makes use of the Papoulis-Gerchberg algorithm to attain a more efficient implementation in terms of computational cost and reconfigurability. For this HFB-based IF SDR receiver, the digital filters compensating the analog design imperfections are evaluated and realtime signal-reconstruction tests for wide-band and narrow-band signals are carried out.

355847,21220,8494,"Design of adiabatic TSV, SWCNT TSV, and Air-Gap Coaxial TSV",2015,"High performance three-dimensional (3D) through silicon via (TSV) interconnects are important for reliability, choice of the filler material is also a critical issue as thermal incompatibility, electromigration, and high resistivity are still a bottleneck. In this paper, single wall carbon nanotube (SW-CNT) bundles as a prospective filler material for TSV are investigated compared to conventional filler materials like Cu, W, and poly-silicon. It is found that SW-CNT bundles exhibit unique electrical, thermal, and mechanical characteristics that can be used to fabricate better TSV interconnects. Moreover, performance comparison between Air-Gap Based Coaxial TSV and conventional circular TSV are presented. The comparison shows that the air-gap TSVs reduce the overall parasitic capacitance and the overall energy loss compared to the conventional circular TSV or conventional coaxial TSV. In addition, TSV-based ADIABATIC logic based on the adiabatic switching principle is presented and analyzed. ADIABATIC logic is a design technique for minimizing the energy dissipation. Its major limitation is the requirement for passive components, which cannot be efficiently integrated into current generation ICs. TSV-based 3D heterogeneous integration may enable efficient integration of these passive elements, which were not practically feasible in the past due to technology limitations."
936871,21220,8494,Crosstalk Effects in Event-Driven Self-Timed Circuits Designed With 90nm CMOS Technology,2007,"Systems-on-chip (SoCs) designed in ultra-deep sub-micron technologies (90nm and beyond) often comprise modules in multiple clock domains (MCD), which are usually interconnected using asynchronous interfaces. At the same time, in ultra-deep sub-micron (DSM) technologies, minimum width, spacing, inter-metal dielectric lengths are reduced, as well as distances between metal layers. These trends raise the coupling capacitance resulting in more severe crosstalks. Therefore, asynchronous interfaces may be subject to crosstalk in ultra-DSM technologies. In this paper, a quantitative investigation is performed to approximate the crosstalk effects in 90nm technology, and to compare them with effects in other DSM technologies. It is found that for wire lengths of 1mm, and more, crosstalk effects in a 90nm technology are substantially higher, about 1.3 times, than in a 180nm technology. Furthermore, three well known self-timed asynchronous design methods are analyzed with regards to crosstalk and the importance of coupling capacitances is established. It is shown that glitches can cause errors in self-timed designs. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to report crosstalk sensitivity in self-timed circuits, which are notably proposed as a solution to the timing problems found in advanced SoCs."
587590,21220,8494,Exact channel routing using symbolic representation,1999,"The layout problem in VLSI-design can be broken up into the subtasks partitioning, placement and routing. As well as the others of these tasks, the routing problem is NP-complete and so in general it is impossible to find an optimal solution to it in an efficient way. However for problem instances of small size, it may be possible not only to generate the best routing with respect to a certain cost function, but even to determine all legal solutions to the problem. We consider the channel routing problem and show how to solve it exactly using symbolic methods i.e. MDDs (Multi-valued Decision Diagrams). The basic operations on MDDs can be carried out very efficiently and thus the necessary time-consuming computations can be speeded up considerably. In our approach, wires in the channel are described as functions of multi-valued variables, and so the grid points and also the set of legal solutions can be represented by MDD-nodes. Furthermore, routability is transformed into satisfiability of these functions. By this we can also decide if a channel is routable. Because satisfiability is trivial for MDDs. It will be shown that the best routing can be extracted from the set of all possible solutions very easily. Finally, experimental results are given to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach."

In order to reduce distortion due to variation of the gate overdrive and the threshold voltage in conventional bootstrapped switches, a PMOS-type bootstrapped circuit combining with a NMOS-type one forms a double sampling switch that transmits input signals to the output terminal. The switch reduces the on-resistance greatly and keeps it constant, resulting in precise sampling of signals and better input bandwidth. A test S/H circuit based on this switch was designed and fabricated in SMIC 0.18-mum CMOS mixed signal technology. Experiments show at 100 MSample/s, a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 100.9 dB, spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 102 dB and total harmonic distortion (THD) of 101 dB can be acquired, and for input frequency up to the Nyquist frequency, this circuit maintains SNDR over 90 dB, SFDR and THD better than 92.7 dB, respectively"
1389940,21220,8494,A bidirectional neural interface with a HV stimulator and a LV neural amplifier,2013,"This paper shows a neural stimulator with 15V supply voltage combined with a neural low-noise amplifier (LNA) with a supply of ±1.65V around the common mode voltage (VCM) of 7.5V. In most implementations, the stimulator and recorder use the same supply domain, thus either leading to low voltage compliance (VC) for the stimulator or to high power consumption in the recorder. Obviously, a separation of both is the preferable choice, but comes with the challenge of effective protection of the low voltage (LV) sensitive input nodes of the recorder. A high voltage (HV) transistor used as a switch between the two parts enables different supply voltages for stimulator and recorder. Thus, a high current stimulator with high VC can be combined with a high efficient LV neural recorder. The presented implementation shows a stimulator with a maximum stimulation current of ±15mA with 5-bit resolution out of a 15V supply. The recording part consists of a LNA with a VCM of 7.5V and a supply voltage of ±1.65V around VCM - VDD LNA =9.15V and VSS LNA =5.85V. It consumes only 11.8μW and achieves an input referred root-mean-square (RMS) noise of 5.5μV in the frequency band of 1Hz to 100kHz.

Characterizations of surface topography using atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle and fluorescence using protein A-FITC were performed to investigate the binding efficiency for the SAMs of 4,4- DTBA and 11- mercaptoundecanoic acid (11- MUA). The results show that the binding efficiency of 4,4- DTBA is higher than that of 11-MUA.

This paper focuses on the detection of click-evoked OAE (CEOAE), using wavelet decomposition, to assist on the diagnosis of possible peripheral hearing disfunctions. A complete wavelet-based modeling procedure for the CEOAE is described, using a powerful toolbox designed for this matter. Simulations indicate that the resulting model reaches correlation levels above 99% with respect to the original CEOAE. Such a match allows an almost-perfect elimination of the stimulus artifact, yielding better detection of the CEOAE and a more precise hearing-system diagnosis."

598546,21220,8494,Blind detection of photomontage using higher order statistics,2004,"We investigate the prospect of using bicoherence features for blind image splicing detection. Image splicing is an essential operation for digital photomontaging, which in turn is a technique for creating image forgery. We examine the properties of bicoherence features on a data set, which contains image blocks of diverse image properties. We then demonstrate the limitation of the baseline bicoherence features for image splicing detection. Our investigation has led to two suggestions for improving the performance of bicoherence features, i.e., estimating the bicoherence features of the authentic counterpart and incorporating features that characterize the variance of the feature performance. The features derived from the suggestions are evaluated with support vector machine (SVM) classification and is shown to improve the image splicing detection accuracy from 62% to about 70%."

In our previous work on classification of protein subcellular location images, we showed that the space-frequency localized information in the MR subspaces adds significantly to the discriminative power of the system. Here, we go one step farther; We develop a new weighting method which allows for the discriminative power of each subband to be expressed and examined within each class. This, in turn, allows us to evaluate the importance of the information contained within a specific subband. Moreover, we develop a pruning procedure to eliminate the subbands that do not contain useful information. This leads to potential identification of the appropriate MR decomposition both on a per class basis and for a given dataset. With this new approach, we make the system adaptive, flexible as well as more accurate and efficient."

Bypassing technique combined with statistical testing based on array of PROs enables resolution of 1 pico-second. Multiple cells under test (CUTs) are embedded into one single PRO through programmability to get mask area cost effectiveness. Extra variation is eliminated by symmetrical duplicate structure. Test results indicate that there is a flex point around 7-stage on the curves of delay sigma/n vs. stage number. Local variation dominates and decreases significantly with the increase of stage number before 7-stage point. For small dimension, inverter is more sensitive to on-chip-variation than NAND. But no same trend is observed for large dimension. Curves of delay average vs. stage number and delay sigma/n vs. stage number among dies based on the same type of cell indicate a good uniformity."

The process uses a thin glass encapsulant to achieve arbitrary shape geometries and flexible modules. These have an efficiency of 5% at 500 lux being suitable for indoor light conditions. The OPV module is designed such that it also operates as an antenna element, such as a dipole to provide an omnidirectional pattern, thus being a dual function device. It has the shape of a flower with a total of 8 petals. Each petal represents a single OPV cell with surface area of about 5 cm2. The petals are then connected in series to achieve a higher voltage. Under 200 lux indoor light condition, the OPV module has a short circuit current (7sc) of 65 μA and an open-circuit voltage (Foe) of 2.4 V, which is enough to power a 2.4 GHz ultra-low power radio together with sensors.

The majority of the ongoing research is conducted on animal models and there is a considerable demand for microsystems that can simultaneously record neural signals from a large number of electrodes in animals that are awake [1,2]. For decades, researchers have been using racks of bulky data-acquisition systems, connected to electrodes through a bundle of thin wires and a pre-amplifier headstage. Wires are wideband and easy to use. However, they can potentially bias the animal behavior and add noise and motion artifacts to the recorded signals.

In general, the non-volatility of FeFET is impacted by its physical structure and there is a trade-off between data retention time and device endurance. To improve the cell endurance, for example, the ferroelectric layer of FeFET needs to be programmed to a low polarization level, leading to a short retention time. In ferroelectric DRAM (FeDRAM) design, degradation in FeFET retention time and write-read disturbance requires the FeDRAM cells to b e periodically refreshed in order to prevent data loss. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive refreshing and read voltage control scheme to minimize the energy overheads associated with FeDRAM refreshing while still achieve high cell access reliability."

Electromagnetic transmission mechanisms through tissue are determined by tissue structure and associated frequency-dependent tissue properties, which are significant in the design of wireless implantable medical devices. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of varying tissue dielectric properties on maximum power transfer to a subcutaneously implanted device in a paired electrode system designed for use in proximity to metallic orthopedic implants. The transcutaneous system including external and implanted electrode pairs was simulated at several radio frequencies (125 kHz, 1 MHz, 13.56 MHz, 403 MHz, and 915 MHz) while varying the dielectric properties of the tissue medium over a range of physiological values. Maximum power transfer was calculated to represent the best-case power gain across the range of tissue properties and frequencies, and greater achievable efficiencies were seen with higher quality factor as a function of the tissue properties. The results suggest that in the paired electrode system, utilization of capacitive coupling allows the system to function in proximity to metallic surfaces such as orthopedic implants. The results also suggest that higher power gains are possible through a choice of implant location based on expected tissue properties."
2845959,21220,8494,Design considerations for reliable OxRAM-based non-volatile flip-flops in 28nm FD-SOI technology,2016,"This paper investigates the design architectures for reliable high-yield low operating voltage non-volatile flip-flops (NVFF) for zero-leakage and instantaneously-on ultra-low power applications in scaled CMOS technologies. A reliable thin-gate oxide NVFF, integrating OxRAM current-based storing and restoring solutions is designed and analyzed in 28nm FD-SOI. The proposed class of NVFF designs has been optimized for optimal OxRAM programming conditions that improve endurance and minimize programming power, while ensuring high yield. The OxRAM device silicon measurements show that a low programming current benefits endurance, but at the expense of a reduced memory window (ROFF/RON). Statistical analysis demonstrates that a low NVFF operating voltage in restore mode can be achieved with a narrow memory window by using the current-based restoring. In a representative design, compared to a standard FF, the non-volatility is added at the cost of less than 3% of performance and up to 3.5%–13% of active energy increase, with 108 cycles of endurance. Then compared with the data-retention FF supplied at 0.5V, NVFF reduces the sleep power consumption for standby modes longer than 0.34s for uniform Q switching (0.17s–0.6s) Finally, the low variability of the FD-SOI technology enables 3 sigma yield restore down to 0.7V."

In this paper, the regression parameters of the module-LRC are analyzed when a query facial image is partially occluded. For removing contaminated modules, the weighted module linear regression classification (WMLRC) is proposed. In order to evaluate the effectiveness, AR face database is used to validate the proposed WMLRC as well as the well-known face recognition methods.

2866284,21220,8494,Instantaneous pitch estimation of noisy speech signal with multivariate SST,2016,This paper presents an instantaneous pitch estimation method based on data adaptive time domain filtering and multivariate synchrosqueezing transform (SST). The filtering approach is implemented with bivariate empirical mode decomposition (bEMD) using white Gaussian noise (wGn) as the reference signal. The bEMD decomposes speech and wGn together into a finite set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The log-energy distribution of wGn's IMFs is employed to determine the threshold used in filtering. The IMFs of speech signal selected by such pre-filtering method is used to construct time-frequency representation (TFR) with multivariate SST. The frequency components are properly localized in the obtained TFR. Spatial filtering and post-processing are applied to TFR prior to estimate the instantaneous pitch. The experimental results illustrate the noise robustness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

2106551,21220,369,"An ultra-wideband transceiver architecture for low power, low rate, wireless systems",2005,"This paper presents the system architecture, modeling, and design constraints for a baseband, integrated, CMOS, impulse ultra-wideband transceiver targeting very low power consumption on the order of 1 mW. Intended for a sensor network application, the radio supports low communication rates (/spl sim/100 kpbs) and ranging capabilities over short distances (/spl sim/10 m). Based on a mostly digital architecture, the analog complexity is reduced by moving the A/D convertor as close to the antenna as is reasonable. Pulses are generated from simple digital switches, overlaying the signal energy on the lower FCC UWB band (0-960 MHz). Reception is achieved using baseband gain blocks feeding a time-interleaved bank of low resolution A/D converters. A window of energy is captured in time and fed to the digital backend for processing. To save power and area, the digital backend implements only a pulse template correlation filter block overlaid with an additional spreading code. As a pulse template is used, no specific channel estimation or interference cancellation is assumed. The system performance is quantified for this case and implementation tradeoffs are explored with a strong focus on reducing power consumption. In particular, the issues of modulation choice, clock generation, gain and noise figure, ADC resolution, and digital signal processing requirements will be discussed."

A normalization technique aims at improving the recognition rate of such a system. In view of this, in this paper, an anchored normalization technique, referred to as improved anchored min-max (IAMM) technique for a multimodal biometric system, is developed. In the proposed technique, the anchor value is computed from the raw matching score sets corresponding to each of the modalities used in the system. This anchor value does not require a priori knowledge of the equal error rates and genuine/impostor score distributions of the individual matchers used in the system. It takes into account the average and variations of the score values that occur more than once in each score set. The performance of IAMM, in terms of EER and genuine acceptance rates @10% and @20% false acceptance rates, is evaluated on a multi-biometric system. The experimental results show that the performance of a multi-biometric system using the proposed normalization technique is superior to that of the uni-biometric systems or to that of the system using the existing normalization techniques."

The comparator uses a current-mirror-based positive feedback and hysteresis to generate the mV-range threshold. It has three new ideas: (1) to use the input signal to bias the current mirror, which only activates the current mirror when the input signal reaches a detectable threshold; (2) to achieve dynamically controllable detectable threshold by using control signals to adjust the mirror transistor sizes; and (3) to use negative feedback to compensate the process-voltage-temperature variation. Preliminary SPICE simulation results using state-of-the-art 9HP (BiCMOS) have shown that the proposed hysteresis-based comparator can achieve the following performance metrics: 1) Very low comparator threshold (in the range of mV); furthermore, these threshold voltages can be programmable at run-time from a few to tens of mV. 2) Steep equivalent subthreshold slope in the range of sub-mV/decade. 3) Ultra-low leakage power (in the sub-nW range for a 0.1mV input voltage) and switching energy (in the nW range). The proposed hysteresis-based comparator only requires one standard logic supply source (working over 1V to 0.5V). Furthermore, initial simulations have shown that this comparator threshold is reliable over the process and voltage (PV) variations, and linearly proportional to temperature (T) variation."

The proposed method statically determines task allocation for given task graph and multi-core system model from task scheduling for fault patterns of cores. In the experiments, we evaluate the task allocation time and the overhead for the execution time while changing multi-core system models, task graphs, and upper bound of faulty cores. The proposed method allocates a task graph with 100 tasks to a multi-core system with 16 cores within a practical timeout condition.

2894112,21220,8494,Efficient multiplication architecture over truncated polynomial ring for NTRUEncrypt system,2016,Truncated polynomial ring has important applications in cryptography. It was probably first used in NTRU public key cryptosystem which is one of the most well-known post-quantum cryptosystems. Recently it is found that a modification to NTRU supports somewhat fully homomorphic encryption where a slightly different truncated polynomial ring is adopted. In this paper an efficient architecture is proposed for multiplication over truncated polynomial ring with application for NTRUEncrypt system. The proposed multiplier is based on the compact structure of a modified linear feedback shift register (LFSR) which can reduce the latency for small input polynomial. The compact-designed arithmetic unit capable of performing both modular addition and subtraction takes input from either of two registers on the left hand side. FPGA simulation results show that the product of area and latency for the proposed multiplier is at most 84% compared to any existing work in comparison.

2363222,21220,369,Adaptive Compressive Sampling for Wideband Signals,2011,"In traditional compressive sampling approach, it's always assumed the sparsity of a signal is known. However, we always can't get this in Cognitive Radio (CR) network. This makes a great barrier to the practical usage of compressive sampling. This paper develops an Adaptive Compressive Sampling (ACS) approach for wideband signals. It doesn't need the sparsity as a priori knowledge. Also, once the sparsity changes, it can adaptively change the proper sampling rate through comparing the different results recovered by different sampling rates. When there is no difference between the results recovered by two different sampling rates, the smaller sampling rate of these two is the proper sampling rate to recover the original information of the signal exactly. Moreover, ACS can provide the unoccupied spectrum holes to Secondary Users (SU) in CR for dynamic spectrum access."

Therefore, an AIC will relax data processing and transmission burden and improve overall power efficiency, making it attractive for wireless vision sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a background subtraction based column-parallel AIC for motion-triggered vision sensors. It features low-power and robust background subtraction for motion extraction as well as efficient information quantization. The AIC is implemented by integrating background subtraction with a successive-approximation-register and single-lope (SAR-SS) hybrid ADC using a new architecture. Targeting at scene interpretation applications, 6-bit background and 8-bit foreground are adopted. Simulation results show that vision data bandwidth and ADC power are reduced by 85.23% and 95.88% respectively when full-bit-depth motion images are required.

It is, however, challenging to maintain the same performance at scaled clock voltages due to timing degradation in the Enable paths that are required for clock gating, another highly popular method to reduce dynamic power. A useful skew methodology is proposed in this paper to increase the timing slack of the Enable paths when the clock network is operating at a lower swing volt age. The skew schedule is determined via linear programming. The methodology is evaluated on five largest IS-CAS'89 benchmark circuits. The results demonstrate an average 47% increase in the timing slack of the Enable path, thereby facilitating low swing operation without degrading performance."

The tracking is performed in a three step-manner: regions of interest (ROIs) are generated by a cluster-based tracking using the DVS output, likely target locations are detected by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the APS output to classify the ROIs as foreground and background, and finally a particle filter infers the target location from the ROIs. Doing convolution only in the ROIs boosts the speed by a factor of 70 compared with full-frame convolutions for the 240×180 frame input from the DAVIS.

The timing yield of systems that contain multiply-add units (MAC) is of great importance since they dominate important applications such as digital signal processing. Specifically, we employ two different delay models for the estimation of delay distributions of RNS and binary MAC architectures. Our analysis quantitatively proves that RNS MAC architectures that use bases of the form {2n − 1, 2n, 2n + 1} demonstrate better normalized delay variation than binary MAC architectures to characterize both their static timing behaviour and the timing behaviour taking into account the sensitizable paths. Furthermore, it is shown that certain simplified RNS MAC architectures outperform conventional RNS MAC architectures in terms of the μ + α · σ delay variation metric."

This voltage-to-current conversion is often done using a single transistor. This results in an exponential (for weak-inversion) or quadratic (for strong inversion) non-linear transformation which severely restricts the type of learning algorithms that can be implemented. To overcome this problem we propose a range of solutions that perform a linear transformation fro m weight voltage to synaptic current, simplifying the implementation of a spike-based learning rules. We demonstrate the application of these conversion circuits using current-mode integrators that produce alpha-functions with biologically realistic temporal dynamics and amplitudes that are linearly proportional to the synaptic weights.

2863275,21220,8494,A tail-resonance calibration technique for wide tuning range LC VCOs,2016,"Tail resonance at double the oscillation frequency is widely used in LC oscillators for reducing phase noise. The phase noise improvement is quite sensitive to shifts in the tail resonance frequency. A 6% error in the tail inductance can cause up to 4 dB increase in the close-in phase noise from the optimum value. Phase noise degradation is quite severe for widely tuned high frequency VCOs where modeling errors and changing output frequency contribute to substantial shift from the desired resonance frequency. We propose a technique to automatically calibrate the tail resonance to obtain the best phase noise. The amplitude of the oscillation across the tail resonant tank is sensed using a peak detector and the capacitor array used to tune this tank is adjusted to maximize this amplitude. This setting maximizes the phase noise improvement due to the tail resonance. A 4 stage left handed LC ring VCO with a tuning range of 8.5 GHz to 13.2 GHz maintains a fairly constant phase noise figure of merit of 190 dBc/Hz for offsets greater than 100 kHz, over the entire tuning range when the proposed technique is incorporated."

Recently, the minimum lifting step structure of the transform was proposed introducing the multi-dimensional memory accessing. It can reduce latency in a parallel processing platform. However, its output signal is distorted due to truncation of multiplier coefficient values. Especially, a few coefficients are extremely sensitive to the truncation in this structure. Therefore a special treatment is required to these coefficients.

The thermal profiles of tasks are first extracted by accurate temperature model. Then run-time task mapping heuristic is proposed considering transient core temperatures, thermal dissipation from adjacent cores, communication overheads and the thermal influence of physical position on chip.

For serial Chien search, the power consumption is substantially lowered by a polynomial degree reduction (PDR) scheme. Every time a root is found, it is factored out of the error locator polynomial. Only the hardware units associated with the reduced-degree polynomial coefficients are active. However, this PDR scheme can not be directly extended to partial-parallel Chien search, which is needed in any systems to achieve high throughput. By analyzing the formulas of the evaluation values over finite field elements and available intermediate results of the Chien search, this paper proposes a partial-parallel Chien search architecture that reduces the error locator polynomial degree on the fly whenever a root is found without using long division. For a 122-error-correcting BCH code over GF(215), an 8-parallel Chien search using the proposed architecture achieves 32% power reduction over existing partial-parallel architectures for a typical case."

In this case, proper extra noise needs to be added to the stimulus in order to whiten the quantization noise. In this paper, a pseudo random dithering method and a low-cost implementation of dithering generator in SAR ADC are proposed. The random pattern is generated from a simple shift register and XOR gate. The dithering is added through the dummy capacitor of SAR ADC during the ADC sampling phase.

1097785,21220,369,A Reduced Complexity K-Best SD Algorithm Based on Chi-Square Distribution for MIMO Detection,2011,"A reduced K-best sphere decoding (K-best SD) algorithm for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detection is proposed. The algorithm reduces the complexity of the K-best SD by combining the statistics character of the signal and the requirement of the quality of service (QoS). In the reducing processing of the proposed algorithm, the chi-square distribution (CSD) property of the signal, the optimal symbol error rate (SER) property and the loss of pruning are considered together to give a theoretic error bound and then a threshold to determined which route can be pruned to reduced the calculation complexity. The algorithm reduces the complexity with a controllable cost of performance decrease. Simulation results on a 16QAM system with 4×4 antennas show that the algorithm can attain the near-optimal performance with a significant complexity reduction comparing to the original K-best SD or maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm."

This test is useful for finding all solutions of nonlinear circuits; it is also useful for verifying the nonexistence of a DC operating point in a given region where operating points should not exist. However, the LP test has not been widely used in practical circuit simulation because the programming is not easy for non-experts or beginners. In this paper, we propose a new LP test that can be easily implemented on SPICE without programming. The proposed test is useful because we can easily check the nonexistence of a solution using SPICE only."

344387,21220,8494,The Memory Problem of Quantum Information Processing,2015,"In quantum information processing, the fundamental rules of information representation are different than in the classical setting. The fundamental unretrievability of some forms of information from quantum memory enable unique capabilities that enhance privacy and security. Unique correlations between quantum bits, referred to as quantum entanglement, enable fundamentally faster algorithms for important computational problems. Quantum bits are very delicate, and require extraordinarily low noise levels in order that they can be stored successfully. However, the long-term storage of quantum information is not hopeless, with relatively new discoveries of unique features of quantum entanglement showing that effective use of redundancy should make possible the solution of the quantum memory problem.

The C implementation of Kvazaar is accelerated by Intel AVX2 instructions whose effect on Kvazaar ultrafast preset is profiled. According to our profiling results, C functions of SATD, DCT, quantization, and intra prediction account for over 60% of the total intra coding time of Kvazaar ultrafast preset. This work shows that optimizing primarily these functions doubles the coding speed of a single-threaded Kvazaar intra encoder for the same rate-distortion performance.

2414244,21220,8228,New Approaches for Lowering Path Expansion Complexity of K-Best MIMO Detection Algorithms,2009,"The present paper proposes two original approaches to reduce computational resources necessary for expanding survivor paths while searching in a K-best manner the MIMO detection tree. The first approach involves precomputing some products that are so far recomputed for each path expansion. The second technique is a new method to compute the path metrics. In all K-best detection techniques proposed so far, the complexity necessary to expand a path grows with the path depth in the tree. The originality of our approach stems from the fact that the path expansion complexity decreases with the path depth. Since the number of expanded paths increases with their depth, our approach better balances the path expansion complexity and the number of expanded paths at a given depth, which can yield a significant complexity reduction. We then present a new K-best Hard-Output Lattice Decoding (K-HOLD) algorithm that combines both proposed techniques. A complexity analysis shows that K-HOLD can reduce by up to 70% the overall path expansion complexity as compared to the less-complex known algorithms [1]. This advantage comes about at no cost in terms of performance degradation."
2870634,21220,8494,High performance low overhead template-based Cell-Interleave Pipeline (TCIP) for asynchronous-logic QDI circuits,2016,"We propose a novel Template-based Cell-Interleave Pipeline (TCIP) approach for generating high performance and yet low overhead asynchronous-logic (async) quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI) circuits. Our TCIP approach exploits the characteristics of the four prevalent QDI cell templates, namely Weak-Conditioned Half-Buffer (WCHB), Pre-Charged HalfBuffer (PCHB), Autonomous Signal-Validity Half-Buffer (ASVHB), and Sense-Amplifier Half-Buffer (SAHB), and then strategically interleave these template cells to form a composite pipeline. There are three main features in our TCIP approach. First, all QDI cell templates are first standardized with the same interface signals, and their corresponding cells are characterized in terms of transistor count, cycle time and energy dissipation for ease of comparison/selection/replacement. Second, our TCIP approach prioritizes the speed requirement when forming the initial pipeline circuits, and then subsequently reduces circuit overheads by interleaving various template cells without compromising the speed significantly. Third, the final optimized QDI pipeline circuit inherently features high robustness against process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, hence suitable for dynamic-voltage-scaling (DVS) operation. By means of 65nm CMOS process, we demonstrate a 4-bit pipeline tree adder based on the proposed TCIP approach, and benchmark it against the WCHB, PCHB, ASVHB and SAHB counterparts. These five designs feature same high operational robustness, nonetheless the design based on our TCIP approach is more competitive. Particularly, the designs based on reported approaches are, on average, ∼1.22× more transistor count, ∼1.21× slower and ∼1.22× higher energy dissipation. Furthermore, under DVS operation from 1.2V to 0.3V, our proposed TCIP adder can reduce up to 88% energy for non-speed critical applications."

In this paper, we aim to provide a realtime depth upsampling engine using weighted mode filtering to alleviate the hardware requirement in such scenarios. An appropriate filter window size is essential for both performance and complexity, and extensive experiments are conducted to choose an 8×8 window. The design bottlenecks are then mainly twofold: high SRAM bandwidth due to large-window source data access and complex histogram processing for a high depth-label count up to 128. These issues were addressed by two proposed techniques accordingly: source spreading and one-the-fly maximum finding. Based on the synthesis results using TSMC 40nm technology, the proposed architecture can provide Full-HD depth upsampling at 43 fps with 247k logic gates and 5.4 kbytes of SRAM."
2884708,21220,8494,Gate-level netlist reverse engineering for hardware security: Control logic register identification,2016,"The heavy reliance on third-party resources, including third-party IP cores and fabrication foundries, has triggered the security concerns that design backdoors and/or hardware Trojans may be inserted into fabricated chips. While existing reverse engineering tools can help recover netlist from fabricated chips, there is a lack of efficient tools to further analyze the netlist for malicious logic detection and full functionality recovery. While it is relatively easy to identify the functional modules from the netlist using pattern matching methods, the main obstacle is to isolate control logic registers and reverseengineering the control logic. Upon this request, we proposed a topology-based computational method for register categorization. Through this proposed algorithm, we can differentiate data registers from control logic registers such that the control logic can be separated from the datapath. Experimental results showed that the suggested method was capable of identifying control logic registers in circuits with various complexities ranging from the RS232 core to the 8051 microprocessor."

Since depth video may contain noise that reduce the coding efficiency, we propose a depth filtering algorithm for 3D depth coding, which exploits the Allowable Depth Distortion (ADD) in view synthesis and is able to improve the coding performance of the depth encoder. Firstly, the depth values has the same rendering position based on the ADD model are clustered. Then, the clustered depth are filtered and set to the optimal depth value for each group by minimizing the view synthesis error. The filtered depth videos are smoother and can be more effectively compressed by the existing 3D High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) depth encoder. Experimental results show that the proposed depth filtering method can assist the depth encoder achieve 5.87% bit rate reduction in terms of Bjonteggard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) and 0.25dB quality gain in terms of Bjonteggard Delta Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (BDPSNR) on average as compared with that of coding the original depth maps."

One of the main issues in designing these systems is the unavoidable energy constraint due to the limited battery lifetime, which strictly limits the amount of data that may be transmitted. Compressed Sensing (CS) is an emerging technique for introducing low-power, real-time compression of the acquired signals before transmission. The recently developed rakeness approach is capable of further increasing CS performance. In this paper we apply the rakeness-CS technique to enhance compression capabilities for electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, and particularly for Evoked Potentials (EP), which are recordings of the neural activity evoked by the presentation of a stimulus. Simulation results demonstrate that EPs are correctly reconstructed using rakeness-CS with a compression factor of 16. Additionally, some interesting denoising capabilities are identified: the high-frequency noise components are rejected and the 60 Hz power line noise is decreased by more than 20 dB with respect to the state-of-the-art filtering when rakeness-CS techniques are applied to the EEG data stream."

2902566,21220,8494,Hierarchical temporal dependent rate-distortion optimization for low-delay coding,2016,"Hierarchical coding structure (HCS) is one of the most important components in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) that improves the coding performance greatly, especially for Low-Delay (LD) coding. It groups frames into different layers and enc odes them with different quantization parameters (QP) and different reference mechanisms. Due to the extensively used inter-prediction, the coding of frames in different layers is highly dependent and an appropriate QP and reference selection scheme may significantly improve the performance by taking advantage of such temporal dependency. However in the current HEVC codec, a predefined HCS, such as the Low-Delay HCS (LD-HCS), is performed without considering the different characteristic of different video contents, thus leading to a suboptimal coding solution. In this paper, the hierarchical temporal relationship under LD-HCS is first investigated and a hierarchical temporal propagation chain is constructed to describe the temporal dependency among frames. Then a hierarchical temporal dependent rate-distortion optimization scheme is developed specifically for the LD-HCS in HEVC. Experiments results show that the proposed scheme achieves BD-rate saving of 2.9% and 2.8% in average against HEVC codec under LD-HCS of P and B frames, respectively, with a negligible increase in encoding time."

According to this classification, many researchers try to determine the particular neural pathways or signal sources related to vergence, and have not been aware that most vergence eye movements are controlled using the same ocular motor system as conjugate movements. I suggest that, in fact, fusional vergence is saccade, accommodative vergence (Baker, R. et al., Ann. B. Y Acad Sci. Part IV, p.171 1981; Robinson, D.A., 1977) is smooth pursuit, flow induced vergence (Baker et al.) is OKP, and the vergence occurring by head movement is a family of VOR. I show the grounds for this suggestion."

408447,21220,8494,A subharmonic detrending or data-smoothing approach for longitudinal road profile measurements,2001,Commonly used figure-of-merits for longitudinal road profiles such as the International Roughness Index (IRI) and the Ride Number (RN) are based on statistical properties. Raw measured longitudinal road profile data may contain large trending components especially when the measurements are made with walking profilers in hilly regions. To obtain approximate stationary data suitable for statistical processing measurements should be subjected to detrending before calculating the IRI- or RN- value. In this paper a novel detrending method is proposed which is well suited for removing large profile trends without significantly corrupting the short wavelength content of the profile data. The method called sub-harmonic detrending works by fitting sub-harmonic sinusoids to the data followed by circular filtering in order to remove the trend. The method is also well suited for data-smoothing.

To increase the sensitivity to higher penetration depth of investigation, the source and the detector separation should be small. We first show with simulation results that short source-detector separations results in the detection of a higher number of photons coming from a greater depth. However, at these shorter distances the number of early arriving photons also increase (mainly coming from the skull and scalp regions in brain imaging) which is a constraint. To reject the early arriving photons we need a gated detector to enable detections at specified time windows. We then confirm these results in an experimental study using a simplified photon detection scheme. The dependency of the photon counts on the gate window and the source-detector separation is analyzed. We conclude that placing the laser source and the detector quite close to each other is an option to consider for the design of optodes so as to improve the image quality in various biomedical appications."

2876791,21220,8494,Fast realistic block-based refocusing for sparse light fields,2016,"View-interpolation-based refocusing achieves realistic quality for sparse light fields but requires lots of computation. In this paper, we aim to reduce the computation load while maintaining the superior refocusing quality. The idea is to interpolate only few views for infocused regions and to perform refocusing on downsampled pixels for defocused area. This is achieved b y a proposed block-based refocusing algorithm which consists of multi-level refocusing mode decision and timing-based bloc k merging. For each variable-size block, the former chooses the fastest downsampling mode given that the distortion is negligible based on a localized filter response analysis. Then, the latter determines the fastest quadtree block partition by minimizing the timing cost which is accurately estimated for each block. Experimental results show that a 10x speedup on average is achieved for realistic refocusing. Also, the computation time becomes comparable to the conventional fast depth-dependent blurring which has serious boundary artifacts."

Our well-developed biomedical image computing system, which automatically extracts and segments the nucleus and cytoplasm of cell in medical images, is no doubt following this idea. Nonetheless, even though previous system provide good algorithmic performance, its throughput is limited by high computation load and data dependency. Therefore, we deploy spectral graph partitioning to improve computation speed of the most complex module, maker-controlled watershed transform for nuclei detection. By modeling our problem as a graph and embedding architectural costs as the attributes in vertices and edges, we equally distribute workload among processors and reduce overhead in data transfer rate. We deploy the proposed approach on Intel Core i7-930 CPU with four cores and eight threads and test 153 medical images; as a consequence, we achieve less data transfer and better load balance as compared to conventional workload distribution through clustering and other graph partitioning methods."

2902559,21220,8494,A low dark current wide dynamic range CMOS pixel,2016,"CMOS Image Sensors have a limited dynamic range. The need to increase the capability of imaging at a broad range of light intensities is of relevant interest in automotive and scientific applications. However, sensors that resolve the dynamic range issues, like logarithmic pixels, suffer from poor performance under low light conditions. This limitation is due to the inherent leakage current that flows through the photosensitive diode even in absence of light, and is hence referred to as dark current. The typical approaches to reduce this leakage current involve process modifications, which are costly, risky, time consuming and often not in the control of the designer. In this paper, a novel pixel design capable of reducing dark current without any process modifications is proposed. The pixel biases a diode at zero potential to reduce the leakage current. This pixel's architecture is based on a double current mirror to maintain the voltage drop on the photodiode as close to zero as possible. In addition, the pixel provides a logarithmic response, thereby capturing a wide dynamic range of intensities. Simulations results are reported showing that this architecture effectively achieves a small potential value on the photodiode."

In the proposed system, back-telemetry data is transmitted by the capacitor switching at the secondary side in two-level. As a result, the secondary side resonates at two different resonant frequencies in different periods of time. To hold the power transfer efficiency (PTE) and the power delivered to the load (PDL) almost constant, a double-carrier technique is introduced. In this method, two external power transmitters are employed, each at different times, such that the power carrier frequency is equal to the frequency at which the secondary side is tuned. Also, the forward data is modulated in PSK modulation on both carrier frequencies. The implemented full-duplex data and power telemetry prototype has delivered 60 mW power to 270 Ohm load with 36% efficiency and data rates of 50 kbps and 10 kbps have been achieved for forward and backward telemetry, respectively."

2876660,21220,8494,Top-level activity-driven clock tree synthesis with clock skew variation considered,2016,"Clock gating is recognized as one of the most effective techniques to reduce the dynamic power consumption. Many research efforts have been paid to build activity-driven clock trees for low power designs. On the other hand, as the feature size continues to shrink, the on-chip-variation (OCV) effect has become a serious concern, especially for the clock skew of the top-level clock tree. Based on this observation, in this paper, we present the first work for the synthesis of OCV-aware top-level activity-driven clock trees. In our approach, the clock skew variation is considered during the top-level activity-driven clock tree synthesis. Our objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the worst timing slack and the power consumption. Compared with previous works, benchmark data consistently show that our approach can greatly increase the worst timing slack with a small overhead on the power consumption."

We show that biologically-inspired spatial pooling techniques can successfully be implemented in the gradient-based image interpolation algorithm and the elementary motion detector to extend low-light capabilities by more than one order of magnitude. We also show that block matching algorithms can accurately compute optic flow even when a single frame may capture <1000 photons. This framework provides a tool to further explore the mechanisms that underlie the observed low-light performance of biological vision systems and to understand the relative performance of different approaches for implementing optic flow in hardware.
2864325,21220,8494,Optimization of the data rate of an OOK CMOS medical transmitter based on LC oscillators,2016,"This paper presents techniques for increasing communication data rates for OOK modulated signals in the case the carrier frequency is generated by a cross-coupled pair LC oscillator. The proposed circuitry completely turns off the transmitter during the transmission of “0” bit and oscillation occurs only when the data bit is “1” to reduce power consumption. The data bit controls the steady state bias current and the operation of the oscillator. The communication data rate is limited by the turn-on and turn-off time of the LC oscillator. In order to speed up the turn-on time of the oscillator, in addition to bias current, an extra current source is used during the build-up of the oscillator. The decay time of the oscillator when the data is switched from “1” to “0” is accelerated by shortening the inductor connections. The concept is demonstrated through the design of an LC VCO in 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The LC oscillator is designed to oscillate in MedRadio band at 416 MHz frequency. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture shortens the turn-on time from 86.5 ns to 24 ns and the turn-off time from 101 ns to 5.93 ns. With the additional techniques, the maximum achievable communication data rate is increased by more than 6 times."

The traditional Sense-Amplifier-Based Flip-Flop (SAFF) has asymmetric rising and falling edges with the fact that the falling edge lags the rising edge the time of a gate delay, which has become a bottleneck of speed. In order to overcome the problem of nonsymmetry of output data edges caused by the set-reset (SR) latch in the Sense-Amplifier-Based Flip-Flop, a new slave latch controlled by the clock is proposed which reduces delay and improves sensitivity considerably. A new type of CMOS logic 2:16 DEMUX is also proposed which can save about 20% area and 15% power consumption compared with the conventional structure.

446969,21220,8494,An efficient algorithm for DTMF decoding using the subband NDFT,1995,"An algorithm based on the subband nonuniform discrete Fourier transform (SB-NDFT) is proposed for decoding dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals. To decode a DTMF signal, its energy at the eight DTMF frequencies must be determined by evaluating samples of the NDFT at these frequencies. In the proposed SB-NDFT algorithm, these NDFT samples are computed by decomposing the input signal into two subbands. Since DTMF signals occupy the low-frequency part of the telephone bandwidth, the higher subband can be discarded for a fast, approximate computation. A performance comparison between algorithms based on the NDFT, SB-NDFT, DFT, and SB-DFT shows that the SB-NDFT requires the lowest number of computations to attain a specified level of performance."

385832,21220,8494,Combining circuit theory and numerical field calculations in designing mini-mechatronic systems,1995,"In mechatronic system design, electrical motors are generally treated by a lumped parameter model and a torque versus speed or versus position characteristic. In the design and optimisation of electrical machines and actuators, as generally used for powering such mechatronics systems, modern finite element based CAD methods are employed. In order to link both approaches, macroscopic parameters are deducted from the microscopic field solution via the appropriate post-processing methods. For normal sized motors, this is a well known approach. However, for mini- and micromotors, requiring a three dimensional field solution, this is far less evident. Therefore, a technique is described to derive the parameters and the torques from the magnetic field for the magnetostatic motors and the electric field for electrostatic motors. The inductances, resp. capacitances are calculated. For the torque not only the average component, but also the torque variations as a function of the position are discussed."

193143,21220,8494,A mutual exclusion algorithm for a distributed network of autonomous nodes,1993,"Mutual exclusion is treated in distributed autonomous environments.

Thus, when the network is large-scale, it is not possible for each node to keep up the information of all other nodes. The authors have previously designed a mutual exclusion algorithm of the single shared resource case for distributed environments of autonomous nodes, based on the Chandy-Misra protocol for Dining Philosopher (diners) problems (K.

Using the proposed biosensor, the concentration of target analytes or pathogens can be remotely interrogated in a concealed, packaged or in a bio-hazardous environment, where direct measurement is considered to be impractical. The presence of the target analytes or pathogens, self-powers a silver-enhancement process which then assembles a chain of micro-monopole antennas. As the size of the silver-enhanced particles grows, the chain of micro-antenna segments bridge together to complete a dipole structure that reflects impinging RF signals at a desired frequency. We validate the proof-of-concept for IgG detection and demonstrate that different concentrations of rabbit IgG (ranging from 20ng to 60ng in this paper) can be detected based on the strength of the reflected RF signal received at a 915MHz COTS RFID reader."

596429,21220,8494,Adaptive negative cycle detection in dynamic graphs,2001,"We examine the problem of detecting negative cycles in a dynamic graph, which is a fundamental problem that arises in electronic design automation and systems theory. We introduce the concept of adaptive negative cycle detection, in which a graph changes over time, and negative cycle detection needs to be done periodically, but not necessarily after every individual change. Such scenarios arise, for example, during iterative design space exploration for hardware and software synthesis. We present an algorithm for this problem, called the Adaptive Bellman-Ford (ABF) algorithm, based on a novel extension of the well known Bellman-Ford algorithm. The ABF algorithm allows us to systematically adapt information for a given graph to a modified version of the graph. We show that the ABF algorithm significantly outperforms previously available approaches for dynamic graphs, which either recompute negative cycle information from scratch whenever a graph is modified, or process the modifications one at a time (incrementally). As an application of the ABF technique, we show that it can be used to obtain a very fast implementation of Lawler's technique for the computation of the maximum-cycle mean (MCM) of a graph, especially for a certain important kind of sparse graph. We further illustrate the application of the ABF technique to design-space exploration by developing automated search techniques for scheduling iterative data-flow graphs."

Hetero-junction Tunnel FET (TFET) have emerged as promising transistor candidates for supply voltage scaling down to sub-0.5V due to the possibility of sub-kT/q switching without compromising on-current (Ion). Recently, n-type III-V HTFET with reasonable on-current and sub-kT/q switching at supply voltage of 0.5V have been experimentally demonstrated. However, steep switching performance of III-V HTFET till date has been limited to range of drain current (IDS) spanning over less than a decade. In this invited presentation, we will review progress in Tunnel FETs and analyze primary roadblocks in the path towards achieving steep switching performance in III-V HTFET."
2899495,21220,8494,Multivariable DG impedance modeling for the microgrid stability assessment,2016,Stability of inverter-based distributed generation units (DGs) is highly dependent on the ratio of DG impedance to grid impedance. To assess the system stability both DG and grid impedances should be known beforehand. This paper proposes a multivariable impedance model for droop-based DGs that are typically employed in microgrids. The proposed model is essential when assessing the microgrid stability and can be utilized to design DG adaptive controllers that mitigate the instability issues triggered by grid impedance variations. A frequency sweep identification method with chirp excitation is used to validate the proposed DG impedance model. The results confirm the accuracy of the proposed DG impedance model in contrast with the estimated one.

Nonetheless, about 10% of all hip implants need to be replaced within 10 years of patients receiving a total hip replacement, typically due to component loosening or infection. The capabilities of state-of-the-art 3D metal printing systems allow research groups and medical device manufacturers to explore entirely new designs for more intelligent and effective orthopedic implants, which may offer improved performance and more effective monitoring.

In TPVM system, the viewers with different active liquid crystal (LC) glasses (i.e., different modulation weights) which are synchronized with the display can see different images (called personal views). TPVM can be implemented by nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with three additional constrains: 1) the values of images and modulation weights should have upper bound; 2) a special view (called shared view) without using viewing devices should be considered (i.e., the sum of all basis images should be a meaningful image); 3) the sparsity of modulation weights should be considered because of the material property of LC. In this paper, we solve the constrained NMF problem by the modified hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS) algorithms. Through experiments, we analyse the influence of different parameters of TPVM to provide a guideline for parameter selection. This paper will provide an algorithmic guidance for the applications of TPVM."

The maximum power transfer in the inductive link occurs when the transmitting and receiving circular coils are aligned on the same central axes. However, when there is either angular or lateral misalignment between the coils, the maximum delivered power to the receiving coil can be significantly reduced. We propose a design of an array of coils instead of a single transmitting coil that through adaptive control of the phase of the coil feed currents optimizes the power transfer when misalignment exists. We demonstrate that the two coil transmitting antenna provides increase in the power efficiency compared to the same area single coil when both angular and lateral misalignment exist in a smart pill application."

It is a very computation intensive process. Adaptive bases method with local optimization is one approach used to speed up the commonly used free form deformation with B-spline transformation model. In this paper, an improved local optimization for the adaptive bases nonrigid image registration is proposed. By using smaller support size for basis function in the misregistration region identification process, the registration speed is significantly increased. The registration accuracy is also improved by using higher grid point density for local optimization in the identified misregistration region. The proposed algorithm not only preserves the advantage of computing local deformation on disjoint regions which trying to solve the problem globally, but also further reduces the running time. It can achieve notable improvement over the traditional methods. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulated and clinical brain dataset with standard measures such as RMSE and mutual information based similarity measure (NMI).

By considering two different types of bounded discrete-delays, two stability criteria are formulated respectively for the case where the information on the discrete-delay derivative is unknown and the case where the discrete-delay derivative be strictly less than one. It is shown that the first stability criterion is an essential improvement over the existing one in the literature. When the discrete-delay is constant, the second stability criterion is proved to be less conservative than the first stability criterion. Moreover, impulsive control law design for delayed RNNs is facilitated by adjustable parameters in the stability criteria. The usefulness of the theoretical findings is demonstrated by a numerical example."

By utilizing the visual parallax of objects at different depths and the sub-pixel information of the images captured by a camera array, we can estimate the shape of the occlusion and reconstruct the background at a higher resolution iteratively. The occlusion shape estimation is achieved by a new method called “seed growth”, which treats the detected feature points of the occlusion as “seeds”.

2828573,21220,8494,Approaching the limits of piezoelectricity driven hot-electron injection for self-powered in vivo monitoring of micro-strain variations,2016,"In this paper we explore the limits of self-powering a piezoelectricity driven hot-electron injection (p-HEI) device used for monitoring mechanical activity in biomechanical implants and structures. Previously reported p-HEI devices operate by harvesting energy from a piezoelectric transducer to generate current an voltage references which are then used for initiating and controlling the process of hot-electron injection. As a result, the minimum energy required to activate the device is limited by the power requirements of the reference circuits. The p-HEI device presented in this paper operates by directly exploiting the self-limiting capability of an energy transducer when driving the process of hot-electron injection in a pMOS floating-gate transistor. As a result we show that the p-HEI device can activate itself at input power levels less than 10 nW. Using a prototype fabricated in a 0.5-μm bulk CMOS process we validate the functionality of the proposed injector and show that for a fixed input power, its dynamics is quasi-linear with respect to time. The paper also presents measurement results using a cadaver bone where the fabricated p-HEI device has been integrated with a piezoelectric transducer and is used for self-powered monitoring of mechanical activity."
2835773,21220,8494,Constrained quantization based transform domain down-conversion for image compression,2016,"The image down-conversion may be used in the block-based image compression because it can help save lots of bit-counts for each individual block. A straightforward way to implement the transform domain down-conversion is to truncate some high-frequency components to get a down-sized coefficient block. However, directly using this down-sized coefficient block to reconstruct a completed image block will lead to a serious quality degradation. In this paper, we propose a constrained quantization based transform domain down-conversion (CQTDD) to help compress each 16×16 macro-block and it makes the coding quality of 1/4 selected pixels (according to a regular pattern) in each macro-block much higher than that can be achieved by using the traditional truncation based approach. Meanwhile, the other 3/4 pixels will be interpolated by using those 1/4 well-reconstructed pixels. Furthermore, these 1/4 pixels are optimized before the compression to help get a more efficient interpolation. Finally, the proposed CQTDD works with the JPEG baseline coding together as two candidate coding modes in our proposed compression scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method may offer a remarkable quality gain, both objectively and subjectively, compared with some existing methods."

2880552,21220,8494,Superpixel-based salient region detection using the wavelet transform,2016,"Salient regions are the most dominant parts of an image, which capture human visual system's attention. Finding computational methods that are able to detect salient regions especially in images with messy background is a challenging task. In this paper, a novel segment-based saliency detection method using the wavelet transform is proposed. The human beings are attracted by objects or regions rather than individual pixels. Moreover, at pixel grid, a sudden change in a pixel from a cluttered scene obtains a high saliency value, whereas at segment grid, the saliency is determined by considering each pixel and its neighboring pixels. Thus, applying fast and efficient frequency transforms at the segment grid can improve the capability of the method in images with cluttered background or repeating distractors. The proposed method is evaluated on several images from a publicly available dataset of natural images. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides larger values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision-recall, and F-measure in comparison to some of the state-of-the-art methods."

However, the scarce number of works in this field highlights that there is plenty of room for the development of new EDA methodologies for emerging nanotechnologies. Standard cells play an important role in this context, since the development of routing and placement algorithms are strongly related to their existence. This work presents a methodology for standard cell design for QCA as well as the exemplary QCA cell library ONE, which is based on the recently proposed USE (Universal, Scalar and Efficient) clocking scheme. Two representative case studies indicate the feasibility of the approach."
2880298,21220,8494,Fast exclusion of angular intra prediction modes in HEVC using reference sample variance,2016,"Intra picture coding using HEVC is very efficient and is applied to video as well as single image compression. However, the cost for this high compression efficiency is the complexity caused by the high number of 35 available coding modes. Existing methods for fast mode decision estimate the mode costs based on the prediction error samples. This paper proposes a smart method to exclude the 33 angular prediction modes of HEVC even before prediction, if they are unlikely to deliver a small prediction error. The sensitivity of excluding these modes can be adjusted by a threshold. Completely disregarding the angular modes leads to a very high bitrate increase compared to the unmodified encoder of almost 18% with a time saving of 51%. However, excluding the modes using an exemplary threshold value, the encoding time can be reduced by more than 20%, accompanied by a bitrate increase of only 0.7%."

2840162,21220,8494,Single channel speech enhancement using subband iterative Kalman filter,2016,"In this paper, we propose a single channel speech enhancement algorithm using a subband iterative Kalman filter. A wavelet filterbank is first used to decompose the noise corrupted speech into a number of subbands. To achieve the best tradeoff among the noise reduction, speech intelligibility and computational complexity, a partial reconstruction scheme based on consecutive mean squared error is proposed to synthesize the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) subbands. An iterative Kalman filter is then applied to the partially reconstructed HF subband speech. Finally, the enhanced HF subband speech is combined with the partially reconstructed LF subband speech to reconstruct the fullband enhanced speech. Experimental results show that the proposed subband iterative Kalman filter based algorithm is capable of reducing adverse environmental noises for a wide range of input SNRs. The overall performance of our method in terms of segmental SNR, perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and computational cost is superior to several existing Kalman filter based algorithms."
2856334,21220,8494,Time-domain PLL modeling and RJ/DJ jitter decomposition,2016,"Bit rates of high speed serial links (USB, SATA, PCI-express, etc.) have reached the multi-gigabits per second, and continue to increase. Two of the major electrical parameters used to characterize SerDes Integrated Circuit performance are the transmitted jitter at a given bit error rate (BER) and the receiver capacity to track jitter at a given BER. Modeling the phase noise of the different SerDes components, extracting the time jitter and decomposing it, would help designers to achieve desired Figure of Merit (FoM) for future SerDes versions. The phase locked loop (PLL) is one of the contributors of clock random and periodic jitter inside the system [1]. This paper presents a method for modeling the PLL with phase noise injection and estimating the time domain jitter. A time domain model including PLL loop nonlinearities is created in order to estimate jitter. The Standard Organizations specify random and deterministic jitter budgets. In order to decompose the PLL output jitter, a new technique for jitter analysis and decomposition is proposed. Modeling simulation results correlate well with measurements and this technique will help designers properly identify and quantify the sources of deterministic jitter and their impact on the SerDes system."
2886776,21220,8494,Adaptive perceptual preprocessing for video coding,2016,"The quantization of block DCT coefficients is too coarse, and will result in much non-uniform artifacts, therefore, blocking and ring artifacts are usually visible in reconstructed video frames especially when the bitrate is not sufficient. In this paper, we present an adaptive perceptual preprocessing (APP) method to reduce the probability of these artifacts generated in video encoding. The APP algorithm employs a novel filter based on just noticeable distortion filter (JNDF) and adaptive bilateral filter (ABF), and they can be adaptively chosen by block characteristics and quantization parameters.

An activity-based power model for 3D NoC power estimation is also proposed; the model is an essential prerequisite of accurate temperature predictions. Besides that, we propose a distributed multi-input single-output (MISO) thermal model for 3D NoC systems, which reduces the computational complexity of temperature updating from m2 to m compared with the centralized multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model for the system with m units.

This paper presents a novel method for estimating dynamic BC using a time-varying multivariate autoregressive (AR) model with spatial sparsity and temporal continuity constraints. The problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior probability (MAP) estimation problem and solved as a least square problem with Li-regularization for imposing the constraints. The Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) method is employed to estimate the model parameters for making inference of dynamic BC. The proposed method was evaluated using synthetic data and visual checkerboard task experiment fMRI data. The results show that the method can effectively capture transient information transfer among visual-related brain regions whereas controlled areas not related to the process remain inactive. These verify the effectiveness and reduced variance of the proposed method for investigating dynamic task-related BC from fMRI data.

2880286,21220,8494,A new diffusion sparse RLS algorithm with improved convergence characteristics,2016,"A new sparsity aware recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is proposed for distributed learning in a diffusion network. The algorithm deploys a RLS based adaptive filter at each node which is made sparsity aware by regularizing the conventional RLS cost function with a sparsity promoting penalty. The regularization introduces certain “zero-attracting” terms in the RLS update equation which help in shrinkage of the coefficients. Each node shares its tap weight information with every other node in its neighborhood and refines its own estimate by linearly combining the incoming tap weight information from neighboring nodes by a set of pre-defined weights. Results on both first and second order convergence of the algorithm are also provided. As simulations show, the proposed scheme outperforms other existing algorithms both in terms of convergence speed and steady state excess mean square error."
